Title     Souls and Shadows Passing~
Recitals  62
Text
I fell asleep in the darkest night And dreamt of stars, long remembered. I
saw a fire, burning bright, A smoke amidst the embers. For though my road
has carried me through Days of joy and care, My weary steps have lead me
to The steps of dark despair. Through hallowed halls, I walk alone,
Fearing my next step to tread, Fear that it will lead me to my own
Anguish, I am filled with dread. The mountains no longer call to me, The
forest's song is gone. My ears are deaf to hope's melody, And Death, sweet
Death... Death, my own, my one.

Listen to me those who will not give way Listen to me those who will

death is nothing to fear It is sweet and the dark embrace welcomes all
without prejudice But know this truth that those whom die at our hands
shall feel the pain of failure May its touch be like a vile poison working
its foulness long after the deed is done

Mine is a story of the great battle of Namall, in which many brave
warriors died. It all started with the foolish human prince, Gamish,
whoose father ruled the land city of Namall, which long ago was built high
in the Dagaard mountains, but was torn assunder in this war i speak of.
Now Gamish was travelling abroard as young men often do, when he espied a
beutiful woman, one as which instantly stole away his heart. but it was a
cruel fate that this very same damsel was betrothed to a prince of
Solamnia, which even in those years, was a great and proud nation, with
knights running back and forth keeping peace and prosperity. Gamish, the
foolish man was too foolhardy to take note of this, and in his love
induced maddness, he stole her away. The prince of Solamnia, a good and
houable man by the name of Relbarb searched up and down Solamnia, untill
he heard word that in Namell, she was being held prisoner by the prince of
that town. Of course, the prince thought she loved him and forced her to
marry him, but she was utterly disgusted by him. So, this Relbarb mustered
all the knights and all his men at arms, and soon he marched upon the city
of Namell, which lay in the Dagaard mountains, fully intending to slay
every last citizen there. A long vattle was fought there, and Relbarb,
diven insane with anger, slaughted ev and Relbarb, diven insane with
anger, slaughted everyne there, every child and every woman, even the
hermit living a mile outside the city was mercilessly killed. But Rose,
the sought after damsell, was so disgussted by both her lovers that her
heart broke and she died weeping in her bedroom. When her two couters saw
this, they attacked one another in such fury that they were both utterly
killed. A sad day it was, for the defenders had fought bravely but in the
end, the city was destroyed, even todey, there is no known trace left of
it, save this tale of its destruction.

Recitals  30
Text
I'll tell you a story, engraved in my mind, of long, long ago.
Of a maiden, a farm girl, or so she was thought so.
Kora, her name, was sweet on every man's lips.
Her ebony hair, her sweet voice, curving effeminate hips.
The apple, the spirit in every man's red wine.
They all raved, danced and said, "Be mine, Only mine".
Her glad parents, fine names in the land.
Had hopes and dreams of giving away her sweet hand. 
Little did they know of the spirit, hiding beneath grace. 
"I am nobody's dearest, no man shall I embrace!
So on the auroric dawn of her eighteenth year.
Kora set out, on a journey, virgin without fear.
An old sword in her hand, a shield made of rust.
Still brave and ever confident, she battled with the dust.
Many a day she traveled, a smile on her face.
Still clad in loveliness, in splendor, and in grace.
She battled the foes across the land, in legend and myth.
She had found her calling, far at last, her battling pith.

A long time ago there was pretty lass.
Her hair was long and fine eyes made of glass.
Her figure was that of an hourglass.
She even attended holy mass.

Ev'ry man and lass Desired her company.
Though she would never lower to her knee.
For the pleasures of the life giving key.
She was in such demand that she couldn't pee.

So she ran away from her controller.
Only taking what was calling for her.
A wee little boy, whose first words were 'brrr'.
This was the last anyone heard of her.

This is her sad story, heed its call well.
If you want to s'rvive don't ring your own bell.
For if you do, Your head will only swell.
Until the only thing left is the smell.
Of memories, and a future most fell.

Recitals  17
Text
Seems like no one thinks too much of me here. And they are glad to tell it
to my face. And they're right; I'm not supposedto be here. I'm completely
out of place. Somehow there has got to be a reason. Evenings as I try to
think it through. There's a bolt from the blue and I see a shooting star.
It's set apart from all the rest. While the other stars are standing
still. He's on a quest. Ev'ry night this shooting star darts across the
twilight sky. 'Cause he knows he doesn't quite fit in and he's longing to
know why. I feel so much better when it's night time; That's when I can
sort of disappear. When the sin is setting, it's the right time.
Pretending I'm not here. Sometimes I just stare into the heavens.
Wondering if the answer is in sight. That's when I see the light of my
steadfast shooting star. On his way to who knows where.
He's so unlike all the stars that he outshines up there. And this solitary
star is an awful lot like me. On an endless search through time and space
for a place that won't seem wrong. If we both hang on for long enough, if
we both somehow are strong enough, We'll find out where we belong.

with you. Whatever you do, take care of my heart. The longer my journey,
the stronger I need you to be. Keep smiling for me; take care of my heart.
Sometimes the nights may be lonely but nothing's as bad as it seems, for
you're my one and only and you're safe inside my dreams. And we'll be
together, though I may be oceans away, and some brighter day I'll hold you
again. Take care of my heart till then. The carriage is waiting, and
people are counting on you, but I need you too. Take care of my heart. The
longer your journey, the stronger I promise to be. Just come back for me;
take care of my heart. I know I'm good at pretending, but this time the
story's too sad, so I'll skipp to the ending anytime I'm feeling bad. When
we'll be together forever, the way we are now, I still don't know how, I
still don't know when, but nothing on earth can keep us apart. Take care
of my heart till then.

And in my twisted face, there's not the slightest trace, of anything that
even hints at kindness. And from my tortured shape, no comfort no escape.
I see, but deep within utter blindness. Hopeless, as my dream dies. As the
time flies, love a lost illusion. Helpless, unforgiven. Cold and driven to
this sad conclusion. No beauty could move me, no goodness improve me. No
power on Earth, if I can't love her. No passion could reach me, no lession
could teach me how I could have loved her and made her love me too. If I
can't love her then who? Long ago I could have seen, all the things I
could have been. Careless and unthinking, I moved onward! No pain could be
deeper. No life could be cheaper. No point anymore if I can't love her.
No spirit could win me. No hope left within me, hope I could have loved
her and that she'd set me free. But it's not meant to be. If I can't love
her, then let the world be done with me.

These lands are covered by many races. Let me inform you about such
places.
The half-elves are easily the greatest race. They have strength and plenty
of grace. A human life is something rather short. Death they shall not
thwart. Elves are cursed with an everlasting life. The more they have to
deal with in terms of strife. Draconians share the same fate as elves.
They bring strife to others and themselves. Dwarves live away under their
mountains. You never see many around the fountains. Ah the gnomes and
their inventions. It seems self destruction is their true intentions. As
for the ogres what is there to say. They smell so bad I wish they would
just go away. Then there are the minotaurs with their horns. Those through
my chest I don't wish to adorn. Finally I come to kenders who are rather
annoying. In the end they really are cloying. These are the races that
walk this land. Without them this world would tend to be bland.

There once lived a little boy.
Whos name is now unkown.
He was a mischievous boy.
Who once frollecked to and fro.
Then one dark and dreary day.
The lad was stuck in a forrest, When the day was dark as night.
He hid inside of a hollowed log, Where two red eyes were waiting.
As lightning struck the boy found the eyes to be a badger!
A badger! A badger!
The badger spoke these words!
"I can take you home lad! But only for a price!"
The boy answered, "What price shall it be?"
The badger finished, "You must scratch my belly, Or I shall eat you whole!"
The boy knew not what to say.
So he merely said, "I shall scratch your belly! When we arrive at my home!"
So the badger showed him the way.
And when they arrived at the house.
The boy did as he was told!
That is of the Boy and the Badger.
Told in the times of old!

Set aside the buried light Of candle, torch, and rotting wood. And listen
to the turn of night, caught in your rising blood. How quiet is the
midnight, love? How warm the winds where ravens fly. Where all the
changing moonlight, love. Pales in your fading eye. How loud your heart is
calling, love. How close the darkness at your breast. How hectic are the
rivers, love? Drawn through your dieing wrist. And love, what heat your
frail skin hides! As pure as salt, as sweet as death. And in the dark, the
Red Moon rides. The foxfire of your breath.

Water from dust, and dust rising out of the water. Continents forming,
abstract as color or light. To the vanished eye, to the touch of
Paladine's daughter. Who knows with a touch that the robe is white. Out of
that water a country is rising. Impossible when first imagined in prayer.
And the sun and the seas and the stars, invisible, as gods in a code of
air. Dust from the water, and water arising from dust. And the robe
containing all colors assumed into white. Into memory, into countries
assumed in the trust. Of ever returning color and light. Out of that dust
arises a wellspring of tears. To nourish the work of our hands. In forever
approaching country of yearning and years. In due imminent lands.

Let me tell you of a fair maiden, Who once lived in a fair castle. One day
She was a beautiful maiden, With cascading locks of gold. whils in her
medow, She heard something that was not old. Upon finding the noise she
saw a small child, One whom had no arms. The child was crying, Adn trying
to warn the maiden of what was about to come. Raiders attacked her castle,
Burned and pilleged it all! Of the fair maiden her story is grim. Each one
of the raiders had his turn with her, Raping again and again. When they
had theyr fun they left her for dead. She was not killed but simply
disembowled, Which she lived throughout. The rest of her story is very
very long. Being that she was very very strong.

Our Fair maiden left for dead soon awakens. She finds that all she owns is
lost to the fire's of the raiders. What is there left for her to do? Cry?
Mourne? Sleep? Nay, She shall take sword and strike with a vengance on
those who did this. The maiden took up her fathers blade and with one
stroke lopped of her hair. She then donned his old armor. The fair maiden
was fair no more. She became on that day a fierce warrior. With her blad
she traveled the land searching for the raiders. one by one She found
them. one by one they fell to her mighty blade. One morn upon awakening
she began to get sick. It could not have been more than three weeks since
the raid. This followed her for every morning after, She was with child.
What became of her is still yet to come.

Title     Ode to the Wandering Mind~
Recitals  6
Text
To and fro, it goes and goes, But never sows its seeds. From here to there
and everywhere, With footsteps swept by seas. "I leave no trace, Nor rhyme
nor reason. Nor do I know the changing season. But I peddle on and
continue forth, To spew out falsities and treason." The motto of the
restless mind, Who travels long and low and high. Never knowing why he
moves, By winds, and seas, and thuds of boots. From Solace to Dart, Xak
Tsaroth, He moves and travels, nothing in his path. He sees and hears, yet
does nothing, The waves of knowledge crashing elsewhere. Doing nothing,
yet seeing all, He presses on with conviction proud. He knows not why, yet
is not questioned, For what on earth could stand so tall? Freedom, power,
greed, and comedy, Trinkets of this creature's journey. And while he asks
for nothing more, Than time and ease and lack of worry. We move and push
him to the ground, And while the pit of neglect may break his fall. It is
a terrible, terrible crime to stall. The Wandering Mind.

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a Stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a Stairway to Heaven...
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh, it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter...
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder...
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
Your Stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a Stairway to Heaven

And sang a song for the sailors that
Would never breath but the sea again.

The last that ever she saw him. Carried away by a moonlight shadow. He
passed on worried and warning. Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Lost in
a river last saturday night. Far away on the other side. He was caught in
the middle of a desperate fight. And she couldn't find how to push
through. The trees that whisper in the evening. Carried away by a
moonlight shadow. Sing a song of sorrow and grieving. Carried away by a
moonlight shadow. All she saw was a silhouette of a gun. Far away on the
other side. He was shot six times by a man on the run. And she couldn't
find how to push through. I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away. I
stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day. Four AM in the morning. Carried
away by a moonlight shadow. I watched your vision forming. Carried away by
a moonlight shadow. Star was glowing in a silvery night. Far away on the
other side. Will you come to talk to me this night. But she couldn't find
how to push through. I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away. I stay,
I pray, I see you in heaven one day. Far away on the other side. Caught in
the middle of a hundred and five. The night was heavy but the air was
alive. But she couldn't find how to push through. I stay, I pray, I see
you in heaven far away. I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day. I
stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away. I stay, I pray, I see you in
heaven one day. I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away. I stay, I
pray, I see you in heaven one day. The last time ever she'd seen him.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow. The crowd gathered just to leave him.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Caught in the middle of a hundred and
five. Far away on the other side. The night was heavy and the air was
alive. But she couldn't find how to push through. Carried away by a
moonlight shadow. Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Far away on the

Title     Song Of the Nine Heroes~
Recitals  6
Text
From the north came danger, as we knew it would: In the vanguard of
winter, a dragon's dance Unraveled the land, until out of the forest, Out
of the plains they came, from the mothering earth, The sky unreckoned
before them. Nine they were, under the three moons, Under the autumn
twilight: As the world declined, they arose Into the heart of the story.
One from a garden of stone arising, From dwarf-halls, from weather and
wisdom, Where the heart and mind tide unquestioned In the untapped vein of
the hand. In his fathering arms, the spirit gathered. Nine they were,
under the three moons, Under the autumn twilight: As the world
declined,they arose Into the heart of the story. One from a haven of
breezes descending, Light in the handling air To the waving meadows, the
kender's country, Where the grain out of smallness arises itself To grow
green and golden and green again. Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight: As the world declined, they arose Into the
heart of the story. The next from the plains, the long land's keeping,
Nurtured in distance, horizons of nothing. Bearing a staff she came, and a
burden Of mercy and light converged in her hand: Beating the wounds of the
world, she came. Nine they were, under the three moons, Under the autumn
twilight: As the world declined, they arose Into the heart of the story.
The next from the plains, in the moon's shadow, Through custom, through
ritual, trailing the moon Where her phases, her wax and her wane,
controlled The tide of his blood, and his warrior's hand Ascended through
hierarchies of space into light. Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight: As the world declined, they arose Into the
heart of the story. One within absences, known by departures, The dark
swordswoman at the heart of fire: Her glories the space between words, The
cradlesong recollected in age, Recalled at the edge of awakening and
thought. Nine they were, under the three moons, Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose Into the heart of the story. One in the
heart of honor, formed by the sword, By the centuries' flight of the
kingfisher over the land, By Solamnia ruined and risen, rising again When
the heart ascends into duty. As it dances, the sword is forever an
heirloom. Nine they were, under the three moons, Under the autumn
twilight: As the world declined, they arose Into the heart of the story.
The next in a simple light a brother to darkness, Letting the sword hand
try all subtleties, Even the intricate webs of the heart. His thoughts Are
pools disrupted in changing wind He cannot see their bottom. Nine they
were, under the three moons, Under the autumn twilight: As the world
declined, they arose Into the heart of the story. The next the leader,
half-elvcn, betrayed As the twining blood pulls asunder the land, The
forests, the worlds of elves and men. Called into bravery, but fearing for
love, And fearing that, called into both, he does nothing. Nine they were,
under the three moons, Under the autumn twilight: As the world declined,
they arose Into the heart of the story. The last from the darkness,
breathing the night Where the abstract stars hide a nest of words, Where
the body endures the wound of numbers, Surrendered to knowledge, until,
unable to bless, His blessing falls on the low, the benighted. Nine they
were, under the three moons, Under the autumn twilight: As the world
declined, they arose Into the heart of the story. Joined by others they
were in the telling: A graceless girl, graced beyond graces; A princess of
seeds and saplings, called to the forest; An ancient weaver of accidents;
Nor can we say who the story will gather. Nine they were, under the three
moons, Under the autumn twilight: As the world declined, they arose Into
the hear of the story. From the north came danger, as we knew it would: In encampments of winter, the dragon's sleep
Has settled the land, but out of the forest,
Out of the plain they come, from the mothering earth,
Defining the sky before them.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.

Oh Palanthas why must you be so dull, My time around the countryside has
brought me here to you, why are you so dull. I can't say it is your fault,
You were built by man. Yet man has made you boring, at least to this lone
elf.

The company was rather nice, Save for an odd little pair He appeared to be
a mage, She something more. She looked into my eyes, I could not look
away, Coin would mean nothing since she wanted me But I did not want her,
At the moment. We went our seperate ways, She to women me to fame. Tis a
sad sad fate being loved by all and none. But she was the one, I let go.

Title     The lord and the Lady~
Recitals  2
Text
There once was a lord and a lady
They met at a bar in a port
It was love at first hatred,
For they did not like the bard
He must have been amused
for he did not find it hard
or he must have been rather bored
for he wrote them a small song
Of love...
He whispered to her
she to him.
back and fourth they went,
deep into the twilight
they kept on whispering soft loves into each other
then they glared at the bard
whom had clearly disturbed them
by singing what was going on.
But he did not stop.
not even with their glares.
but perhaps a coin
would make him only stare.
But no one knows.
What he shall do
for the man
is surely blue.
If you know not what I mean
You are clearly thick.
And the girl was angry
and the cheeky little prick

Title     The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late~
Recitals  8
Text
There is an inn, a merry old inn.
beneath an old grey hill,.
And there they brew a beer so brown.
That the Man in the Moon himself came down.
One night to drink his fill.
The ostler has a tipsy cat.
that plays a five-stringed fiddle;
And up and down he runs his bow,
Now squeaking high, now purring low,
Now sawing in the middle.
The landlord keeps a little dog.
that is mighty fond of jokes;
When there's good cheer among the guest,.
He cocks an ear at all the jests.
And laughs until he chokes.
They also keep a horned cow.
as proud as any queen;
But music turns her head like ale,.
And makes her wave her tufted tail.
and dance upon the green.
And O the rows of silver dishes.
and the store of silver spoons!
For Sunday there's a special pair,.
And these they polish up with care.
on Saturday afternoons.
The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,.
and the cat began to wail;
A dish and a spoon on the table danced,.
The cow in the garden madly pranced,.
and the little dog chased his tail.
The Man in the Moon took another mug,.
and then rolled beneath his chair;
And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,.
Till in the sky the stars were pale,.
and dawn was in the air.
Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:.
The white horses of the Moon,.
They neigh and champ their silver bits;
But their master's been and drowned his wits,.
and the Sun'll be rising soon'!
So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,.
a jig that would wake the dead:.
He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,.
while the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:.
'It's after three' he said.
They rolled the Man slowly up the hill.
and bundled him into the Moon,.
While his horses galloped up in rear,.
And the cow came capering like a deer,.
and a dish ran up with the spoon. Now quicker the fiddle went
deedle-dum-diddle;
the dog began to roar,.
The cow and the horses stood on their heads;
The guests all bounded from their beds.
and danced upon the floor.
With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!
the cow jumped over the Moon,.
And the little dog laughed to see such fun,
And the Saturday dish went off at a run.
with the silver Sunday spoon.
The round Moon rolled behind the hill.
as the Sun raised up her head.
She hardly believed her firey eyes;
For though it was day, to her surprise.
they all went back to bed.

Title     Nemo~
Recitals  8
Text
This is me for forever. One of the lost ones. The one without a name.
Without an honest heart as compass. This is me for forever. One without a
name. These lines the last endeavor. To find the missing lifeline. Oh how
I wish. For soothing rain. All I wish is to dream again. My loving heart.
Lost in the dark. For hope I'd give my everything. My flower, withered
between. The pages 2 and 3. The once and forever bloom gone with my sins.
Walk the dark path. Sleep with angels. Call the past for help. Touch me
with your love. And reveal to me my true name. Oh how I wish. For soothing
rain. All I wish is to dream again. My loving heart. Lost in the dark. For
hope I'd give my everything. Oh how I wish. For soothing rain. Oh how I
wish to dream again. Once and for all. And all for once. Nemo my name
forevermore. Nemo sailing home. Nemo letting go. Oh, how i wish. Name for
evermore.

Title     Star Wars Cantina~
Recitals  10
Text
(Voice of Princess Leia) "Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope".
Her name was Leia. She was a princess. With a danish on each ear. And
Darth Vader drawing near. So R2-D2. Found Ben Kenobi. He'd have to put the
Death Star plans. Into the rebellion's hands. So Luke and Obi-Wan. Had to
get to Alderaan. So they stopped into Mos Eisley to have a drink with Han.
At the Star Wars, Star Wars Cantina. The weirdest creatures you've ever
seen-a. Here at the Star Wars, Star Wars Cantina. Music and blasters. And
old Jedi masters. At the Star Wars. His name was Solo. He was a pilot.
With a blaster at his side And a smile 12 parsecs wide. There with
Chewbacca. He was a wookie. They met with Luke and Obi-Wan. About the
Millenium Falcon. Docking bay ninety-four. Stormtroopers at the door. With
a flash of Ben's light-saber, now there's an arm on the floor. At the Star
Wars, Star Wars Cantina. The weirdest creatures you've ever seen-a. Here
at the Star Wars, Star Wars Cantina. Music and blasters. And old Jedi
masters. At the Star Wars. (Voice of Ben Kenobi) "Mos Eisley
spaceport...you will never find the more wretched hive of scum and
villainy. We must be cautious". His name was Yoda. He was a muppet. Darth
Vader was so bad. And by the way, he's Luke's dad. Luke kissed his sister.
His hand got cut-off. In that galaxy far, far away. Luke has had a lousy
day. Boba Fett was so mean. Jabba had bad hygiene. Why didn't they all
just relax back on Tatooine. At the Star Wars, Star Wars Cantina. The
weirdest creatures you've ever seen-a. Here at the Star Wars, Star Wars
Cantina. Music and blasters. And old Jedi masters. At the Star Wars.
(Voice of Ben Kenobi) The force will be with you...always".

Roses whisper goodnight. 'Neath silvery light. Asleep in the dew they hide

When the dawn peepeth through. God will wake them and you. Slumber sweetly
my dear for the angels are near.
To watch over you the silent night through. And to bear you above to the
dream land of love. And to bear you above to the dream land of love.

call out my name. Listen, my child, you say to me. I am the voice of your
history. Be not afraid, come follow me, answer my call and I'll ser you

the voice. I will remain. I am the voice in the fields when the summer's
gone. The dance of the leaves when the autumn winds blow. Now do I sleep
throughout the cold winter long. I am the force that in springtime will
grow. I am the voice of the past that will always be. Filled with my
sorrow and blood in my fields. I am the voice of the future, bring me your
peace. Being me your peace, and my wounds they will heal. I am the voice
in the wind and the pouring rain. I am the voice of your hunger and pain.
I am the voice that always is calling you. I am the voice. I am the voice
of the past that will always be. I am the voice of your hunger and pain. I
am the voice of the future. I am the voice, I am the voice.
