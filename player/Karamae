Act  CDEFGQT
Desc A black robes with hood are the first noticeable thing you find, trimmed
in dark blue druidic symbols depicting the violence of the seas. A mask,
made of dull black wood is set over his face, matching the typical contours
one would find underneath, with eye slits being the only openings. The same
dark blue trim of his robes adorn his mask. Sea-green eyes, full of a
dark taint and malice, studiously peer out from the slits, surveying his
surroundings and those around him. The robes are open, displaying his black
hide armor beneath, thick and ready for battle. White fur trim lines the
collar of his jerkin and the tops of his gloves and boots. A hide sash
flows from his right hip across to his left shoulder and back down again,
slitted and filled with knives, while pouches hang from his belt in a few
places.
 
Were his mask not on, and his hood not drawn, one would notice gills below
his elven ears, and his dark blue skin. Straight hair, adorned with the
occasional braid and seashell, would flow down to the middle of this male
sea elf's back, and his pointed ears are adorned with several silver hoops.
He stands at just under seven feet, slightly smaller than average, and
he maintains a fit, well muscled build, and would look to roughly weigh a
very fit 200 pounds. A scar runs from the edge of the right of his nose
down to his jaw, slightly curved, and his body is marred by many vicious
scars, products of torture. He can normally be found to wield a black
wooden spear, with a gleaming silver blade. The blade is large, thick
a the base and narrows at the point, and has a very slim angle for
penetration, though is designed to be used to slash as well. The metal is
etched in a dark blue druidic symbol, as designed by the wielder. The
butt of the weapon is adorned by a round pointed metal piece of the same
gleaming silver, to add force to blunted strikes from that end. His arms
are tattooed in druidic symbols, one for the rage of a storm, and the
other a tribal depiction of devotion to the sea, all in a slightly off
blue from his skin, making them difficult to see.
