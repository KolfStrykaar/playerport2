Desc Out of the Shadows appears what once might have been a man.  He looks as
if he is roughly six foot tall, As you can tell he is tall lean, slightly
muscler.  His head has nearly any flesh left.  What little that still
clings to his cheeks and lower jaw forming a guesome grin; along his
cheeks the skin is stretched tightly as four scars that seem to be ash
grey, running diagonally from his ear's to his blacken lip's on both sides
of his {wskull{x.  Bits of the {Dblack{rflames{x seems to spit off the
scars and dance on the wind.  This things {Wskull{x is {Dblack{x as coal
and his left eye glows a {gdark emerald {Ggreen{x.  While the his right
lacks an eyeball and is just the same {gemerald {Ggreen{x orb of energy
burning in the eye socket.  The man is clad in a large black robe.  It
falls around his skeletal frame.  The sleeves are missing and reveal the
lean muscles of his amrs; he has tight fingerless gloves that cover his
for arms.  His hands are stained black.  His skin is pale and has black
stains covering it.  You notice on the back of the robe is a Skull with
{Dblack{rflames{x surrounding it.  As your eye's drift down to the lower
half of the robe you notice that it is in tatters.  Tattered strips of
cloth seem to ruffle in a deathly cold breeze; despite the lack of wind.
He has {Dblack{x leather pants studded with what look likes {Donyx{x.  On
his belt is a {Dblack{x leather spell pouch; and a whip curled upon a
{Dblack{x leather loop.  The whip seems to be made of the same
{Dblack{Rflames.  The handle is {Dblack{x leather with the words in
lettering {RDezath{x.  On the other side of his belt is strapped a
{WSkull{x handled shovel.  The shovel has ruins that pulsate along the
shaft and on the blade of the shove reads an inscription {yShovel{x of
{DDeath{x.  Tattered strips of cloth seem to ruffle in a deathly cold
breeze; despite the lack of wind.  He has {Dblack{x leather pants studded
with what look likes {Donyx{x.  On his belt is a {Dblack{x leather spell
pouch; and a whip curled upon a {Dblack{x leather loop.  The whip seems to
be made of the same {Dblack{Rflames{x.  The handle is {Dblack{x leather
with the words in lettering {RDezath{x.  On the other side of his belt is
strapped a {WSkull{x handled shovel.  The shovel has ruins that pulsate
along the shaft and on the blade of the shove reads an inscription
{yShovel{x of {DDeath{x.  The man begins to laugh softly as he reaches
back of his robe and slowly pulls the hood over his head.  He begins
chanting mystical arcane words as withdrawing from the robe a {Donyx{x
ball. His eye's turns to orbs of {Dblack{rflames{x as shadows dance across
the man's face; obscuring your vision of the gruesome sight.  As the chant
fades you see {Dblack{Rflames {x spread across his body flickering and
fading forming a protected shield.

Backg Born Shadwofang, Zeath spent most his young life in Ergothian in till
his mother (Ravenmoon) was branded a Dark elf.  They left Ergothian and his
mother started to teach him the ways of necromancy.  Growing up Zeath never
knew his father.  All he was told was; He was powerful wizard.  Ravenmoon
and Zeath took up residence in Palanthas where his mother tended graves.  
 
Ravenmoon taught Zeath in secret during their year's in Palanthas. She died shortly after his 18th birthday due to a plague. She left him a spell book and a bit of steel to live on. He soon took over tending the graves, and working on his dark arts. Zeath found out he had control over shadows.  He honed his skills and came across a daemon that marked him.
Soon after being marked the Umbramancer; had forbidden him entrance into the conclave due to the fact he was marked and feared the daemon would have too much power over Zeath. Upon his search for power he has learned that his father was a Conjuror skilled in pyromancy. 
 
Zeath has found out that he is the result of demonic possession. His father Dezath was possessed and consummated with his mother. Ravenmoon ended up giving birth to a Half-elf with demonic blood. He now carries the soul of the Daemon; and his fathers.  The daemon's soul is bound in an {Donyx{x crystal orb; while his father's soul is placed in the handle of a whip. He is learning to harness the power of the {DOnyx {rflame{x.
 
  Zeath has learned to create a shield help give him added protection. The shield he has learned to make allows him to pierce the darkness to see things that hide within it. The Flames do not produce light or heat. The Flame is as cold as death it self. His goal is to harness this power and to teach Master Rayo that he is more powerful than the Umbramancer. He has lied and betrayed many of souls just to get to where he is now.
 
  He used the thieves to learn how too by pass traps and by pass locks that are protected against magic. He betrayed the magi's of the tower to rise in the rank's of the Undead. Zeath powers grow strongly day by day. Soon he hopes to be one of the chosen; to be the great force of The Lord of the Undead Chemosh. 
He will teach all that he is no pawn. His pride knows no bound; May all those who wish to use him face his fiery wrath. May there be their soul's fuel his flame and their body's be his toys. Using those toy's as fodder for his Lords armies. 
 
  Soon all will know him as The Dreaded {DBlack{rflame{x {YLich{x - of the {DEternal army{x. May his name strike fear in the hearts of man, woman and child. Let all those oppose the Dark Lord Chemosh; Know their death will come and their souls will be reaped by the blackflame in the name of his God!
