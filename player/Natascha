Desc {DTwo {Gemerald green{D eyes stare forth from a pale face, tinted with
black kohl around the edges. The pupils are vertical, almost reptilian in
nature. Silky, dark hair often obscures them -- the unnatural sheen of the
hair giving her an almost doll-like beauty. Two oversized, pointed elven
ears poke out from the sides, and at times her strands would be brushed
back behind them. Her pallid pink lips tend to curl into a cynical smirk,
and her face is free of any blemishes or wrinkles -- young-looking, even
for elvenkind. The pallid girl's nose curls upwards, her nostrils
displayed -- giving her visage an almost puglike, yet attractive
appearance.

She stands at a rather tall stature, though appears to be rather thin --
her black and velvet robes hug her lithe frame, accenting what little
curves there are, though at the same time managing to be loose and
comfortable. A corset hugs her chest, with a collar coming up to a
neck-length, hiding away her tiny effeminate features. Oversized sleeves
drape her arms, well-groomed bare hands often times peeking out from
within. The hem of her robes is adorned with {gserpentine{D runes,
gleaming at times with arcane energy.  A leather belt allows for spell
components and a book to hang from her waist, carefully organized as to
not become cumbersome.

A {Wplatinum{D, metallic staff formed in the shape of a viper would often
be found wielded, {gjade{D eyes glaring from the snakelike weapon. The
only other weapon that would be found on her person is a sheathed
stiletto-dagger, displayed in plain sight towards her side. It too is
ornate, the black hilt jeweled with {Gemeralds{D and emblazoned with
necromantic scenes. The mithril blade is typically metallic, though it has
an almost prismatic quality to it in the correct light. A light amount of
jewelry is found on her digits -- her right hand having an apparent signet
ring, rather morbid in its craft. A {Wsilver skull{D holds a {rruby rose{D
in its teeth, the stem of the rose a dark {gemerald{D.

Her legs would he hidden behind silken leggings and buckled leather boots
that reach knee-height. The hem of her robes would start to part close to
the boots, though still trail towards the ground. A rather strange scent
would follow in her wake, enticing one's olfactory senses with the smell
of burning, intoxicating incense. She has an obvious look of nobility --
and arrogance -- flaunting her status as a dark wizard in the open; it is
as though she was a child not only of the Black Moon, but a family with
mortal power as well...
{x
~
Backg Natascha is the daughter of he who has been said to have been the best
Towermaster the Towers of High Sorcery has seen -- Archmagus Darkahn
Kiralv. She takes great pride in her family's name, though she will never
state who her mother is.

Indeed, it is because she has too many to name. She was not "born" in the
sense of being conceived by any natural means, but was created by her
father. She is, in essence, a shell of flesh built to house a particularly
dark soul. As such, it is little surprise that necromancy comes so
naturally to her.

She shares the family name with two brothers and two other women -- her
father's ex-wife, and her father's current wife. She becomes viciously
jealous of anyone who garners more of her father's attention than she
does, and has little shame in making a show of her discontent in any
matter.
