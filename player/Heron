Vers 10
Act  DEFGT
Desc The slow dripping sound of water hitting the ground is heard. You notice
it is coming from a tall, slender, oddly dressed man before you. The
majority of his torso , shoulders, and back seem to be a dark brown scales
that resemble a turtle shell, while his sides have slits that sometime
flex as gills.

Looking more closely, you notice pale skin, dark circles surrounding green
eyes, topped with a pile of messy blonde hair. It is obvious that he cares
little for looking good, quiet likely walked out of the ocean and into
town with little thought of the matter. Behind him, a trail of wattery
footprints can be seen.

The dripping seems to be coming from a long dagger on his side, which
resembles a large sharp tooth cradled by an intricate handle inscribed
with symbols of the Seawolves. His left forearm concretes the fact in your
mind that he comes from the depths as a small symbol is etched into his
skin. The symbol is of the temptress Zeboim.
