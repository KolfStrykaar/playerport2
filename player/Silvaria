Act  CDGHLMQT
Desc {gThe eyeless socket of a {Wbroken deer skull{g, split unevenly in half,
stares out from one side of this young woman's head. The skull has been
sun-bleached, polished, and carved with intricate tribal designs. One
antler remains on the skull, and it has been carved as well, into a thin
spiraling horn that curves back over the young woman's head. Attached to
this skull-mask is a headdress of {ycarved bone beads{g, secured in place
by dozens of sturdy threads. These bone beads have been decorated in much
the same fashion as the skull mask she wears, and sometimes clink against
themselves as she moves.

The part of her face that can be seen is covered in scars. Her lightly
tanned skin is meshed with them, and they travel further down her neck,
below the collar of her shirt. Her features are petite, though her eyes
are wide and keen. Should much attention be given to her eyes, it would be
seen that the eye mostly concealed by the mask has no color -- the iris is
{Dsolid black{g. Her left eye is a {ybright russet brown{g. Strands of
{Wsilvery-white hair{g sprout from her head and fall around her shoulders,
contrasting her youthful image. If nothing else had revealed her heritage,
the elongated ears that poke through her hair on either side of her head
would reveal her elven blood.

She stands perhaps a little shorter than an average human woman, and her
body is wrapped in lithe muscle. This fails to detract from her
femininity, but reveals that she leads a rigorous lifestyle. Her garb
accentuates ease of movement rather than drawing attention to any specific
feature. Of her matching armor, the most notable pieces are a decorated
tabard of cloth worn about her body, bearing a signet of a {ygolden branch
crossed with a longbow{g, and a {Ddark leather brace{g that she wears upon
her left arm. The rest is embossed with designs of {yvines and leaves{g,
in varying shades of dark green, grey, and black.

She has chosen to leave her right arm bare, and upon it, the tattoo of a
{Dblack bramble{g twists and curls upon her skin. Almost as though it had
been caught within the thorny twists of the brambles, there is a strange
symbol. A {Wskeletal hand{g holding a {rred, slit eye{g, encircled by a
black snake that eats its own tail is etched into her skin, oddly dark for
one of the forests, such as she. Floating around her is a dancing ball of
{cethereal light{g, which sometimes reveals itself as a {Ctiny, glowing
spirit{g of a {Csongbird{g.{x
~
Backg Silvaria is a kagonesti who suffered the harsh treatment of a group of
Qualinesti elves who enslaved her race for servants and laborors. She
spent many years of her adolescence struggling to free herself from the
city, only to receive tenfold the punishment other, more 'obedient',
slaves did. As such, over her time in Qualinost, she became scarred and
embittered towards mages and 'noble' elves.

She ended up in the clutches of a particularly cruel family, with little
love for each other, much less for members of other races. They were known
as the Dalginos family, and she endured particular horrors over the course
of several decades in their service. Finally, with a stroke of luck, she
took a chance to fight for her freedom, and fled the city to roam the
surrounding forests for over two decades.

Fate would have her find her way to Solamnia -- and curiosity would lead
her to Palanthas. Here, she lost a companion, and gained another, albeit
he was not at all who or what she expected. Upon posting an ad for a
partner to travel with, a draconian approached her to answer. Naturally,
she was unsure of his trustworthiness, as he often spoke of nibbling on
her appendages... But she took his offer, nonetheless, and it was through
him that she was discovered by Darkahn Kiralv.

Due to her previous disposition towards mages, she distrusted and despised
his interest in her, but her interest in him began to grow as he lingered
about her presence more and more. It seemed, to her, that each time they
spoke -- regardless of how he pestered her -- she always found out
something new about him that intrigued her, and piqued her curiosity. It
happened one day that her curiosity threw her into a spiral of dark magic
and darker secrets, when, while alone in his office briefly, she opened
his journal and was, thus, cursed to relive his memories in her dreams.

Over the duration of this time, during which her dreams were tormented by
the years of Darkahn's own painful youth, she had to struggle to come to
terms with his promise: that she would need to be silenced, should she
learn too much. After several attempts at removing the curse end in
failure, the curse backlashes upon Darkahn, linking the two of them for
some time. Darkahn relived Silvaria's memories in the same way that she
relived his -- though hers were understandably less clear.

Already guilt-ridden by Silvaria's situation, Darkahn began hunting down
what faces he could decipher from her memories, to grant her some form of
peace that those who had caused her harm had suffered equally. However,
her memories granted little information, and those he could find were
reformed or near-dead. He finally discovered her arrogant kidnapper, and
helped her to destroy him -- but by doing so, he in turn angered the
remainder of Nazzim's organization of assassins.

A month passed them by, and then two. Perhaps, in his guilt, Darkahn
agreed to travel with Silvaria to a city she had seen in his memories --
Kalaman. The journey was relaxing in itself, though the memories tortured
both of their dreams, in addition to nightmares from Silvaria's
subconscious that were so intense, they would drag Darkahn into them with
her. From these, and the recurring themes having to do with her parents
and her past, the necromancer suggested that Silvaria confront her
parents' spirits. This, they did, and after finding both of them haunting
their burial places, Darkahn helped Silvaria lay them to rest.

More time passed, and Silvaria slowly came to terms with her looming
death. She did her best to keep to herself -- to keep her pain inside and
not let it show. Perhaps she did it out of shame, or perhaps to keep
Darkahn from feeling worse about what he felt he had to do. In doing so,
however, the curse was able to feed upon all of her despair, sorrow, and
embittered anger. It twisted and grew into something sentient and cunning.

Finally, when she discovered Darkahn's true nature -- the secret about him
that he would, undoubtedly, kill her for, she was kidnapped. She was
summoned away from his private chambers, and the same kidnapper who had
haunted her dreams was there to torture information from her, before
killing her -- what he thought was a good enough revenge upon the loss of
his own life, which had been 'restored' by Chemosh. The small group does
succeed in pinning the necromancer so that he has to watch the event, with
the loss of only one member of their little team. Silvaria suffers through
their beatings without speaking a word of the information they seek.
During the interrogation, Darkahn is freed, and the majority of the team
responsible for the attack flees in terror. Silvaria is left, bleeding and
broken, and Darkahn makes a choice... to save her existence, by turning
her into one of the Nuinqua. She remains comatose following her
transformation, and for several days following the attack. Meanwhile,
Darkahn sees that the curse, which had previously only marked her right
arm, has now marked the majority of the right side of her head. Upon
further investigation, he finds that the curse keeps her comatose, and
hides her memories from her, to "keep her sane".
