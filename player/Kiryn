Desc {yLeather and chain clings to this woman like a well-crafted glove, with
little care for accenting her tall figure. Everything upon her body seems
to have been chosen because it has some sort of use. The leather bodice
that wraps around her chest keeps her full bosom well out of her way, and
the chains and straps that hang from it keep an assortment of tools and
supplies close to her hands at all times. Her pants are a loose, yet
durable cloth that is protected by hard leather chaps. A chain belt wraps
around her waist, as well, keeping the chaps in place. These chaps have
burn marks down the length of them that stop around her knees. Just below
her knees, starting about mid-shin are a pair of leather boots with
plating over the toes and around the heels. They are held closed by
similar leather straps, but also by durable cord.

The woman's skin is darker, similar to deep amber honey. Her hair is
black, and very long, but has been shaven along the sides of her head. The
rest is tied back in a very tight braid that starts at her hairline and
reaches down past her hips. Her facial features are soft and friendly,
with large {cblue{y eyes and full, dusky pink lips. Should she flash a
smile, her teeth are bright white and aligned, seeming elvish in their
perfection. Surely, if that did not reveal her heritage well enough, her
ears are lightly pointed at the ends, belying some elven blood in her. The
rest of her facial features are human in their likeness; a nose that
flares widely and a forehead that is much more human than elvish. Her body
is much more human as well. Complementing her six-foot height, toned
muscle gives her the look of a panther; long and powerful.

Most notably, at her hip, she keeps a large hammer. Around her neck is a
thick chain that dangles over her chest, giving home to an equally thick
charm in the form of an iconic hammer. This hammer is repeated on other
less noticable pieces upon her person; such as her hard leather arm-guards
and on the backs of her fingerless gloves. Her arms remain bare, and
tribal tattoos around her upper arms look to be like knots of cord
twisting around each other in endless symmetry.{x
