Desc The single shouldered smoky blue dress hugs this womans upper body.  Her
exposed arms show a piece of thin black leather tied to her upper right arm.
Her left arm bears a full sleeve tattoo from her shoulder to hand with only
the underbelly of her forearm showing colored ink.  A diamond engagement
ring and wedding band sit on her left ring finger.  A slit runs up the right
side of the dress, stopping just below her hip it shows simple black flats
on her feet and a double weapon sheath buckled to her upper thigh.  
 
Wavy light blond hair is loosely braided over her left shoulder with
longer bangs swept to the right.  A pair of diamond earrings can be seen
from time to time in her ears.  Light green eyes flecked with yellow, stand
out against her darker eyelashes.  Pink lips hold a soft smile, looking
darker against her naturally sun-kissed skin.
