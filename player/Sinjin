Act  CDEFGHLMQTX
Desc Before you is a dark frame, a common horse under the obvious

weight of a mailed knight.  The air feels more crisp in the

presence of the rider and a smell of corrosion and death fills

your nostrils.  His armor is of premium quality, all humming

lightly with a dark aura.  His body is largely covered in the 

intricately designed equipment, flicking shadows cover all

the spaces left bare by his armor.  Pulled over his face is a

bright red face mask, features contorted into a savage snarl.

The horseman is well armed, with a runed polearm strapped to

his saddle, a shortsword on his hip and a vicious two handed

mace strapped to his back.  The warriors garb and demeanor

suggest his experience and willingness to do battle.

~
Backg Since the beginning of existence the heart of man and beast alike is set

to a purpose.  A path that some choose, but more are drawn to.  Necessity

towards honor or deceit and everything in between.  A lesson well learned

by a half-elven child raised in Palanthas.  Too many times scolded as a boy

for pursuing those not in favor, only to reveal the good in their heart.

It was in such practice and habit that the boy became accustomed to the

aiding of the weak and the salvation of those who would seek it.  Even from

a casual glance, it could be seen the boy had chosen his path.

 

The boy stayed active and began training at an early age.  Even as a child

he held in good standing with the citizens of Palanthas and was quick to

recieve aid in his education.  A local scholar trained the mind in the morning

whilst a neighboring cityguard would school him in the evenings.  The boy's

days were well filled between daily training and his ever growing list of

chores.  His body continued to grow strong and his wits ever-sharper.

As the days passed the boy became a man, well known and respected in his

hometown for good deeds and quick payment.  His gaze spread outwards as he

explored the world around him, always looking for new adventure and

friendly faces.  His travels broadened his knowledge of different cultures

and deities, while exposing him to the hardships of life outside familiar

places.

 

The man's continued training and hard work through his adolescent years

have turned his physique stone and his intellect razor-sharp.  No amount of

kindness has left him however, for the relationships built with the citizens

of Palanthas have carved a path of good for him.  For those who do not know

him, his name is Sinjin and he stands a beacon of honor and moral excellence.

 

Going into his adult life, Sinjin took interest in protecting the people of Palanthas.

His journeys abroad and experience with the locals gave him a vested interest in the

security and well being of his comrades.  Over time, he was accepted to the Holy Order,

along with his companion and life-long friend Arlanthis.  The two excelled at representing

for Justice in a time of sparce Solamnic control.  The city and it's patrons soon looked

to the young fighters to keep them safe.

 

In a relatively short period of time, the two men had quelled more brawls and cleansed the

city of more evil than was ever expected by the locals.  The land was embraced in relative

peace and the populations flourished.  Short lived however, for the forming of the ranks

of Takhisis soon gripped the city in dread.  Sinjin and Arlanthis, along with other

members of the Order, formed ranks to deflect the attacks of Solanthus.  The losses on

both sides were grievous, the armies of Takhisis soon overwhelming the diminshed armies

of Solanthus.  The pair of warriors and their guard were forced to retreat to Palanthas

where they successfully defended their hometown from the advancing hordes.

 

After the calming of the siege on Solanthus, the forces of darkness' presence in the city

became more and more common.  Sinjin and Arlanthis were obliged to continue their savage

delivery of Justice to those who brought evil into their stronghold.  After some time,

the citizens wished to see the two men promoted to Solamnic Knights.  Their tales of 

honor and valor proved them worthy of such positions, their natural policing skills

sealing their commitment with the Solamnic Order.  The men were sworn in and given title

within the guild, representing for the force of Light in a dark time for the people.

 

The Knights experience leading up to this moment prepared them for the Justice to come.

Evil had never seen a duo capable of such merciless slaughter.  Talented in crowd control

and individual criminals, Sinjin and Arlanthis were revered for their services to Palanthas.

 

Ten years later, Sinjin had grown quite accustomed to daily battle and attempts on his life.

His feelings of paranoia long gone, his skin hardened and calloused from the constant abuse of

battle.  The mental weight of his duties began to wear on him as his temper and his methods of

policing became more aggressive.  He would now not tolerate any Takhisis followers or undead 

near the city walls.  Their presence was nothing but a pestilence that needed to be 

obliterated from Krynn.  Arlanthis, sharing the same ideas and morals, battled against the

forces of evil with Sinjin for the many years they served as Solamnics.

 

Towards the end of their service to Solamnia, the people of Palanthas began to whisper

of corruption and evil deeds.  The men's lifelong service, at the risk of their own lives,

was portrayed as corrupt!  The two reacted swiftly, wishing to quell any rising rebellion

that was clearly misinformed.  The culprit was dealt with, but the people continued to

whisper in dark corners and quiet places.  The Knights continued their tireless endeavor to rid 

evil from Palanthas forever, or so they thought.

 

Sinjin, taking time in the Questmaster's office to read over papers and important documents

was given message by another trusted friend.  The message was grim and informed the now High

Warrior of the Solamnics that his most trusted life-long friend Arlanthis had been killed and

resurrected as a member of the undead voluntarily.  Sinjin knowing his friend best of all, knew

the choice was simple enough.  The oaths made seemed trivial compared to the daily struggles he

went through with Arlanthis.  Sinjin agreed to join his friend, embraced in Death.
