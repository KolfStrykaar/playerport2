Desc {DAncient robes drape about the features of this lithe form, the blackened


velvet pristine throughout the ages; numerous runes of a dark {rred{D in


the stitching. Skeletal hands that reach from his arms remain masked, save


for the maintained digits that are revealed by the fingerless silken


gloves; his head and face bare, save for the silky black hair that flows


freely from his scalp and far past his shoulders, its well-groomed and


healthy craft obtaining a sleek sort of shine to its palette. Strands of


its nature ocassionally obscuring his face; its fine, brushed look doing


much to complement his noble appearance. Somewhat narrow and slanted eyes


stare forth in monstrous format, their once elven nature transformed into


that of a serpent's; the iris a silvery gray, and the pupil a vertical


black slit -- their gaze forever staring forth from his eternally youthful


visage.



His face's appearance is by all means youthful, an artificial look of


perfection gracing features, free of blemishes or scars, of deformity or


abnormalities, though he is by no means pure; twisted by the darkest of


magics, and the blackest of hexes. His teeth, should they be revealed,


would show their sharpened form as well. His height is that of six and a


half feet; numerous objects of obsidian clinging to his tall frame.


Visible on his right ring finger, a ring of a {Wskull{D with a {rrose{D in


its teeth; on his left, a ring of a Raven, obviously worn and old. His


ears blatantly show him as an elf, but even they do not match those of


pure blood, their thin and over-sized form inches longer than what they


should be.



{DWielded in his right hand is a staff of almost equal height as himself;


a head resembling that of a cobra atop of it, from which two {rruby{D eyes


stare forth; though the make of the staff itself is an almost spine-like


bone, resembling a fleshless serpent. Around his waist, is an atypical


blackened sash of silk, with a stain of {rblood{D upon it. Hanging from


the sash, an ebony-palette shroud, often times its contents revealed. All


manner of arcane objects, such as potions and scrolls, remain visible


inside. Furthermore, a curved dagger with the make of an obsidian craft --


a strange enscription upon it -- hangs from the left side of the sash.



{DA slightly thick black string wraps around his neck; hanging from it an


amulet that rests above his solar plex, an ominous black crescent moon,


surrounded by a faint {rmalicious{D glow. Shackles of an obsidian make


clasp his wrists and ankles, though their chains are long since gone; but


worn as if a token of years long since past. Black leather boots, polished


and laced, cover from his feet to his shins. His smell reeks of a strong


aroma of lilies and roses, as well as potions and spices -- though the


intent of the artificial scent is obvious -- to mask the putrid stench of


death.{x



~
Backg Historical archives stained yellow speak of a family of magi, all of which


embraced the black arts of Necromancy. Known as the Kiralv dynasty, their


history is one where neither truth nor lie have any objective existence.


Darkahn Kiralv, the most infamous of them, was born to a Silvanesti who


was once held as a highly esteemed cleric of E'li -- Silianti. When


Silianti's true nature as a renegade necromancer was revealed, and he was


allegedly murdered by the Conclave of Wizards, the sheltered and then


unknown Darkahn continued his father's research within the manor.



After years dedicated to intense study, Darkahn was spotted one night from


a window inside the abandoned manor. The estate was set aflame, and


Silianti's only son was believed dead. The apprentice necromancer


survived, however; his life preserved by his fleeing into the underground


labs beneath the now charred and ashen mansion; here began the strange


tale of the elven pawn, played for a fool by gods who toyed with the


vengeance in his heart -- only for him to turn such vengeance upon them.



Tricked by the Dark Queen Takhisis into believing that the Conclave of


Wizards had been responsible for his father's death, Darkahn left the


ruins of the Kiralv Estate for Neraka. He continued his studies in the


bowels of the undercities for months, awaiting any attempt to prove


himself to the Dark Knights. Eventually, Darkahn was found by the


Draconian necromancer Sievel Daemona, whom apprenticed him within the


Knights of the Thorn.



The Silvanesti -- then, still quite young for one of the race -- displayed


his penchant for necromancy, but also his self-preservation and dedication


to himself. Never truly holding firm loyalty to the Dark Queen, Takhisis


herself saw his heart -- trading his soul to a darker god, still.



After his unit was ambushed by the Knights of Solamnia, Kiralv was accused


of purposefully giving sensitive information to a spy network of


mercenaries known as the "Raveneye." Whether the claims were true or not


have never been verified, but Darkahn's guilt had already been assured.



Darkahn was personally executed by who was then the Lady of Night --


Tattiana.



He awoke within the Heart of Death, the pulsating caverns deep within


Dargaard, devoid of any emotion sans the vengeance which still burned like


a raging fire. Initially without freewill, the pain of existing in a


rotting body and the hatred for those who had wronged him ate away at the


Satyr's shackles like acid spit forth from a dragon.



Chemosh, then impressed by the necromancer's resolve, allowed this seeming


act of rebellion against his own control -- but for a price. Darkahn's


remaining flesh was seared from his bones by the flames of the Abyss, and


he would serve as the Archlich of the Eternal Legions.



Darkahn's mastery over his own art was sorely underestimated even by the


God of Death. While seemingly swelling the ranks of the Eternal Legion, a


vast majority of those raised by Darkahn's touch were not servants of


Chemosh -- but him.



Darkahn's fading memories of mortal life over the course of nearly a


century were restored when he discovered a journal he had kept until his


death at the hands of the Knights of Takhisis, revealing to him that the


death god had twisted and warped them despite the supposed return of his


free will.



Enraged, the necromancer launched a plot against all of his enemies in one


fell swoop.



Darkahn hatched an alliance with the Knights of Takhisis and the


Mercenaries of Sargonnas, forming a monstrous invasion force filled with


countless soldiers -- both living and dead. Surroudning Palanthas, the


Knights of Takhisis conquered Solanthus with relative ease. The


Mercenaries obliterated Dart and Vingaard from within. Lastly, Darkahn


took hold of Kalaman -- not by raw force, but by bribing its living


rulers...a shadow government which exists even today.



In a complete disregard for some sort of vain honorable, scheduled battle


the Knights of Solamnia and the Knights of Takhisis agreed upon, Kiralv


ordered an immediate legion-wide attack when he realized the Conclave had


abandoned Wayreth and taken residence in Palanthas.



Though casualties were enormous, and the Dark Legion briefly held an


occupation of certain Palanthian territories, they were ultimately pushed


back by the combined strength of the Solamnic Knights and the free-willed


Conclavians -- one of which, was Darkahn's own father; the very much alive


Silianti.



With the realization that he had now been played as a pawn by not one, but


two gods, Darkahn utilized an old pathway into the Abyss that had not been


touched since the days of Dalamar and Raistlin. There, he saught out his


god Chemosh, angrily confronting him face to face in pure insanity. Though


he fought well, he was of course a mere mortal -- Chemosh mocked the


necromancer, going as far as to say his very soul had been a creation of


the Dark Gods, as well as something greater... a god whose name was not


known to mortals.



In the process of imprisoning his soul, as if a failed project, Darkahn


was rescued by the combined effort of the true God of Black Magic --


Nuitari -- and several of the elite Black Robes. Plucked from the Abyss,


Darkahn was returned to Ansalon -- his life, at least seemingly, restored.


There was but one catch to Nuitari's gift; the necromancer would take part


in the Orders of High Sorcery, and be allowed to enact his vengeance so


long as he served magic, serving Nuitari by proxy.



The Necromancer gladly accepted.



Centuries have since passed...
