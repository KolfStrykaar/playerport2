Vers 10
Act  CDEFGLQT
Desc {bA young elf is here, standing perhaps five and a half feet in height.
He holds a lithe and toned build, his skin marked with days of battle
with scars, each held proudly. While appearing delicate, he stands
proudly and confidently. He looks at the world through eyes of {Bdark azure{b,
and they glisten with magical prowess and a {Ddarkness{b of unknown origin.
His {Wpale{b skin stands in contrast to his eyes and hair. His {Dblack{b hair,
flecked with {Bblue{b, flows to his shoulder blades, hanging loosely.
His ears hold multiple symmetrical hoops of {Dblack{b. His body is
adorned with {rcrimson{b tribal and mystical tattoos, each performing a
different meaning and function. He wears his attire in layers, partially
weighing him down, and yet, providing more means of protection. About his
body is a {D{w{Dblack velvet{b{b{b robe, with {rred{b runes of power and protection sewn
into the hems. A {Dblackened{b medallion of faith hangs from his neck openly.
Over this, he wears his {Dblack{b chain mail hauberk that stretches down to
his knees, and the sleeves end at his elbows. Over his forearms he wears
{Dblackened{b bracers, etched in runes of protection and stylized with thorns,
each holding a {rruby{b set into the metal. His hands are adorned with {Dblack{b
leather gauntlets, with the tips of his fingers cut out to allow him to grab
spell components and still retain flexibility to ply his craft. His feet are
covered in soft {Dblack{b leather boots in the elven fashion. Over this, he
wears an {washen{b cloth robe that is open in the middle, showing off his
chain armor, but strapped down to a belt that is around his waist, used to
hold spell components, keeping his chain mail tight to his body. A
{Dblackened{b, thorned pauldron settles on his left shoulder, attached by a
leather strap to his belt, running through a slit in his heavier, outermost
robe. Over his right shoulder extends the hilt of a bastard sword, and in his
right hand he wields a spear, made of a {Dblack{b wood, with a gleaming {Csilver{b
blade, and a {Csilver{b claw holding a small {rruby{b in the bottom. A spellbook
is strapped to him, and settles along his left hip, ready for quick access
should he need it. Over his head, and attached to his outer most robe is a hood
that keeps him concealed from the elements. He has a large {Dblackened{b round
shield to accompany the rest of his armor.{x
