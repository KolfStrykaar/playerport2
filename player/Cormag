Desc {rDraped in finely pressed {Rred robes{r this middle aged 
Silvanestis medium legnth {Wplatinum{r falls lightly at ear 
level. His striking elf features fully visible in the light, 
his high cheek bones, and angled chin along with the 
slenderness of his face and the pointed ears really give him 
his Elvin beauty.
{rGrasped firmly in his hand the elf brandishes a devestating
 staff  glowing with an odd red glow that almost pulsates with
 energy. He leans heavly upon the staff using it for slight 
support. In his other hand he holds a spell book that appears
 to be splattered with now dried blood.
{rYour eyes follow down to his finger tips and you take notice
 at his waist line where s thin {Dblack belt{r is fastened 
holding up a light pair of {Rred robe{r bottoms, a flicker of
 light flashes infront of the elf leaving a faint outline
 around the elf revealing a protection spell around him.

Backg I guess my story starts out like any other, When I was young I was found
to have the ability to make simple illusions appear, like this one time I
was at one of fathers parties and I made a dragon appear in the middle of
it all. I know now that these "illusions" were simple cantrips. As time
went by I started to learn how to do it at will my parents, who I will not
state names, were happy that I had such a gift. They took me to be
apprenticed under a white robes elf who lived in the city.
He explained a lot of things to me, how to scribe simple spells, and how
to brew to an extent. One day he was going over the stars and planets and
moons, and upon looking into the sky that night I looked up and saw a
black hole in the sky, the hole I saw that night was Nuitari. At that
moment he sent collision of mental images and words into my head, He
offered me power and knowledge that I have grown to thank him for, if not
for that night and him showing me the path who knows if I would have ever
gotten out of those white robes.
After the instant that all of this flashed before my eyes I turned to my
Shalafi and asked him what is the spot in the sky that seems to suck the
light from the rest of the universe, his first reaction was horror of
course, in my ignorance I had no idea what I had just asked or that it
would lead to my exile.

So, many years have passed since I have been exiled from my homeland and I
have been officially stated a mercenary. My journey for the Tower of
Wayreth ended in me wondering the forest for nearly a month, with the
feeling of rejection in my heart, I held a great hate for the conclave, I
hunted their members and killed several of them.
I had fun on my journeys with the mercenaries, my favorite, being the time
Konrad, Luther, and I took a sail with a minotaur friend of ours and ended
up killing a sea-serpent. I stay as a mercenary for a period of time until
eventually I met these contractors Named Mikhal Emenious and Garrard Ohme.
They bought me that day, bought my life and my soul. From then on I
devoted myself to the Lich Lord, to the point of being evicted from the
Mercenaries. This part always gets a tad cloudy, but I was brutally beaten
by a man named Luther. When I woke up I was in the home of my shalafi,
Yerthorn Stormspell. He convinced me to join the conclave, so after months
of training and preparation I took the test of high sorcery, I won't go
into detail about this but I haven't been the same since. I was now I full
member of the conclave of mages.

My time as a apprentice was short, only because I joined while I was at
such a mastery of my art. Three months after being admitted to the
conclave I was promoted to position of teacher where I met my first
challenge, a Young illusionist named Alagareth.
He is long since dead and gone now, but he sure gave me a run around and a
headach I still blame part of my insanity on him. As time went on my
memory started to return to me. Bits at first, then as time grew my hate
for the conclave returned with it. I stayed awake for hours and hours, it
might have been days at a time, thinking of ways to get back ot the
conclave for tricking me and not telling me who I was. Until one day I
remembered, I was still under ownership, I still belonged to Mikhal
Emenious. I approached the Lich at the place the Sheppard's meet high up
on a mountain, and he explained everything to me, on that day I became a
spy for the undead legion. I sabotaged so many of the conclaves planes
against the undead, and I was never once caught. As I advanced into being
a High mage my position of being a spy became increasingly important.
After awhile of spending time together I because one of the most trusted
people to Mikhal, the old man never was much for names he always referred
to me as "the dark elf" I guess it kind of stuck with me.

Years pass and I never get caught, but one day the lich stepped down from
being the vessel of undeath, and some fool stepped up to take his place, I
do not remember his name but he was very foolish. This is when I strayed
away from the undead seeing my opening to return to my magic and my focus
on furthering my knowledge in order to please Nuitari.
long after this decision I was finally blessed with the Mark of Nuitari,
and I become a renegade hunter. I hunt for years and years, my service to
the conclave has not gone unnoticed and I am promoted to the rank of
archmage.
Then I meet a young necromancer, Zenfrel, she is the first student I have
taken since alagereth, and well, she surprised me, she was smart quick
minded and powerful, she helped me create a living being, and then helped
me kill it. She is now a high mage of the black robes and does her own
thing.
After a few months, after everything has settled down, I receive a letter
from Rayo, Stating he is stepping down from his position as Ordermaster,
and leaving it to me.
