Standing tall and proud is a very large and muscular human.  His face
shows little expression, with the exception of his jaw muscles twitching now
and then, which could be a sign of impatience.  He is dressed down in silver
armor that has been polished to a brilliant shine.  The armor is almost
cerimonial in appearance.  Upon the silver breastplate he so proudly wears,
resides a large red crest of a Dragon.  Upon the dragon's head is a golden
crown, a symbol used to show his position amongst the Palanthas Guard as
being the Captain of the Guard.  The Captain stands almost unmoving, like a
statue, waiting for his subordinates to return with city reports on all the
activity of Palanthas.  Calm as he may seem, his right hand sits on the
pommel of his sword, as if ready at any given moment, to do battle if
necessary

Otho is grotesquely fat man dressed in rich clothes.  Apparently the
money changing business pays quite well in this busy city, or possibly the

Strong and determined, the Captain of the ship stands here.
~
Standing over eight feet tall, this gruesome looking Minotaur looks like
he means serious business.  Trying to barter with him for special trips
seems to be out of the question.  He wears a light, leather vest, only
buttoned at the bottom, leaving his heaving, massive chest open for plain
view.  He carries no weapons, or any other items for that matter, save one
key that's strapped to his waist.  Odds of getting that key are pretty much
out of the question.

A bookish looking man of middle age stands here, sorting through a large
stack of parchment.  His fingers are stained with ink, and leave occasional
streaks as he absently wipes the sweat from his balding head.  His
expression is friendly, though his eyes have a somewhat beady appearance due
to squinting at various forms for hours on end.  Scanning the pages with
practiced ease, he pushes a pair of large spectacles from the edge of his
nose as he stamps various applications deemed worthy of approval.

A small, furry pet cat walks around looking for its owner.

Before you stands a small furry cat.  Around its neck appears to be a
collar with a small name tag dangling from it.  The writing on the tag
appears to be scratched too much to read.  The cat's fur coat is covered in
dirt, but appears to have been white with black spots when it was cleaned
up.  The cat walks around from person to person, looking up at each one,
then pausing for a brief moment as if it were looking for someone specific,
perhaps her owner, before trodding off and down the street to the next
person.

~
He is of large build.  He appears to be young and in quite good shape for
a Mage.  Long flowing Red Robes drape over his body, his hood pushed back,
putting his bald, smooth head on display.  He holds open, a book written
with all the slightest tricks of Illusionry.  He levitates closer towards
you, or does he?  Perhaps it's another one of his grand illusions he likes
to cast to better train his pupils.

The mage seems to be as young as twenty years old, but it is obvious that
he is much older, for his skills far exceed those of a young beginner.  His
black robes absorb all light in the room, save for what you have.  His eyes

greets you with a menacing grin.

his head seems to follow your every move.  He carries a large, twisted staff
in his right hand, and a thick ancient book in his left, containing all the
secrets in the art of Conjuration.  He appears to be waiting to train you,
perhaps you should stop gawking and start learning the great knowledge of
Conjuration.

Astinus Lorekeeper is the head librarian of the Library of Palanthas.  He
is often emotionless, expressing his feelings (if any) only at extremely
rare occasions.  He has proclaimed himself to be neutral in all things,
using his knowledge of the current happenings to help others rarely.  He is
aided by his Aesthetics, who keep the library in shape and protect it. 
These men try to be like Astinus, gaining as much knowledge as possible.

The Ogre standing before you, towers everyone else in the room, standing
at a record height of twelve feet.  His right hand grasps the handle of a
dual-bladed sharp axe.  In his left hand, he holds a long dagger as if it
were a toothpick.  His left eye has a black patch covering it, most likely
lost in a fight.  Many scars cover his arms.  He glances in your direction
with a stern look.  Perhaps you should stop gawking and begin practicing
your skills, or learn new ones.

a strange sight to see on an Ogre.  His hair is quite short and his temper
even shorter.  A large, two-handed axe rests behind him.  His sole purpose

You have entered the living quarters of the aesthetics and apprentices. 
Most of whom live their entire lives in the library.  It is not un-heard of
to know an apprentice that hasn't left the walls of the library in months. 
This particular room is filled with cots, at the foot of each cot rests a
foot locker where the resident keeps all of their belongings.  It is obvious
that they life a simple life, by the lack of personal items.

These elaborate quarters appear to have been the design of a military
fanatic of some sort, or perhaps the inner workings of an overzealous
Captain.  The walls are garnished with weapons and shields and pieces of
armor, some polished to a brilliant shine, others still stained with blood
from old battles long since forgotten.  A small desk rests in the back of
the room with a large, open ledger on top.  The ledger appears to have a lot
of scribbling on its viewable pages. A small ink pen, still wet with fresh
ink, lies on the right side of the ledger, while a bottle of half-used ink
is to the left.  The room is well lit, with candles adorning the walls and a
large lantern sitting on the desk.  The smell of heavy musk lingers in the
air.  Looking around, it would appear that there is only one way out, and
that is back to the south.

This full rigged sailing ship was once used in battle, during the War of

rises behind the bow.  The four masts carry both square and fore-and-aft
sails, and two insignia sails, one with the emblem of a Solamnic Knight, the
other of an odd looking contraption, probably one built by the Gnomes of Mt
Nevermind.  The deck of the ship has been stripped down and most of its
armaments removed, save for a large cannon at the aft end of the ship. 
Docking gates are mounted on the East and West sides of the ship.

passengers.

This tiny graveyard is littered with ancient headstones and mausoleums. 
Once a tribute to the nobles of the city, the graves have been sadly
neglected; many are overgrown with vines, cracked by age, or toppled by the
elements.  The area carries a wistful sense of despair, as if those buried
within longed for days past.  Once a magnificent memorial ground for the
cities richest families, the pathetic remnants serve only to remind that
wealth is fleeting.

Magical orbs of light, float gently around the room high above in the

Mages of all orders of the Conclave, rest on stools, couches and even the
floor, reading and memorizing spells from their spell books.  Some mages
appear to be in deep meditation, a strange glow emanating around them. 
There are three additional rooms which branch off from here.  The room to
the north is where mages specializing in the art of Illusion go to practice.
The room to the west is where mages whom dabble in the art of Enchantment go
to practice.  To the south, the always feared Necromancers, go there to

The Guild of Illusions~
Many pulsating arcane objects are floating about the room.  One large
object in particular, floats in the center of the room.  Looking at it, it
appears to change shape, turning into large Dragon.  A man drabbed in Red
Robes comes levitating forth and through the Dragon, proving it to be only
an illusion used to scare off unwanted thieves....  And Kender.  A few small
sconces have been placed throughout the room, giving it a small
illumination.

The Guild of Enchantment~
As you enter the room, you are taken aback by the multitude of spell
components that line the shelves in this room.  Some are stored in bottle. 
Yet others are enclosed in ornate boxes.  All of the items seem to have some
magical purpose to a mage.  The air here is filled with the scent of herbs
and perfume.  A large workbench sits in the middle of the room, also filled
with various spell components.  On one particular shelf you notice many
scrolls.  Most of them are contained in simple scroll cases, but some are
enclosed in silver, rune covered cases.  Before you can fully grasp the
amount of magical items and components in the room, your concentration is
interrupted by a mage wearing White Robes who politely clears his throat
and smiles at you.

The Guild of Necromancy~
The first thing that you notice as you enter this room is a large red
pentagram etched into the center of the floor.  The room itself is dimly lit
by a single red orb, suspended in mid-air.  The walls, ceiling and floor are
all made from black obsidian.  A strong smell of sulfur slightly irritates
your eyes.  The light from the orb flickers revealing a decayed corpse
hanging from chains on the wall.  As you allow your eyes to become more
accustomed to the dim light, you notice yet more grotesque, mutilated bodies
in various states of decay, lining the walls.  You notice that aside from a
single desk in the far corner, the room is devoid of furniture.  A mage
dressed in black robes steps from the shadows to greet you.

Denmark (which surely is not the capital of Sweden!).  Former ruler of
Scandinavia, England, Northern Germany, Northern France, Russia, Greenland,
Iceland, Estonia etc. etc.
   The sight of those large, wholesome chokoladeboller makes your mouth water
and your soul sing.

Fine bladed weapons, made right here in the shop, are displayed
prominently in the front of the store.  You can even see the forge and anvil
in the back of the store, along with all sorts of smithing tools hung on the
wall for easy reach.  Also displayed, though less prominently, are weapons
not made of metal, which the weaponsmith bought from other craftspeople to
sell here.  He realized that not everyone can stand the weight of a metal
weapon, and that some people are forbidden by they gods to spill blood.  The
weaponsmith will also buy weapons from you.  If they're good enough quality,
he'll offer them for sale.  If not, he'll melt them down and use them in his
next batch of weapons.  Looking around the room, you only notice a female
dwarf standing here.  Perhaps she's his apprentice?  Or perhaps she will
explain why "HE" no longer is working here.

The Temple Altar~
Although the entire worship hall is covered in a white glow, this
particular section seems to possess the most illumination of any spot in the
church.  Before you stands a raised dais where the priests of Paladine
perform mass and prayer services for those who worship the great god of
good.  Along the walls are many intricate murals, depicting Paladine and
other gods of the good pantheon.  The floor of the dais consists of a large
stone mosaic, depicting the visage of Paladine himself, an elegant platinum
dragon.  On the center of the dais stands a white marble altar, decorated
with various platinum ornaments.  Along the steps are several sick and
wounded people, looking for healing from the priests of the temple and the
God they worship.  The healer here will temporarily allow you to practice
skills and spells.  This is for those who cannot find their Guild, or do not
have one in this city and do not yet wish to explore to find other cities
that may have them.

E
dragon~
This large statue is of a Dragon, but appears to be slightly different in
design, than what typical Dragons look like.  The statue is made out of pure
platinum, to represent the Father of Good, Paladine, as he would appear in
his Dragon form.  The statue has a slight glow to it, and one could almost
swear that the statue was peering down at them, smiling ever so elegantly.
The base of the statue is made from stone, and has some sort of writing
etched into it.  Upon close examination, it reads...
{x
{x             'My devoted children. Repent your sins, and I shall
{x             grant you divine favor. Speak thy words aloud, and I 
{x                              shall hear you'
{x
{x             Father of Dragons, I repent and ask for forgiveness!
