{CThe Knights High Road{x~
This is the end of the Knights High Road.  The road becomes a bridge to
the east that crosses a wide and deep ditch.  On the other side of the
bridge stands the mighty Solamnic fortress of Vingaard Keep.  The ancient
home of the Solamnic knights stands here proudly and defiantly as an ancient
symbol of the knights strength.  Even from here light can be seen glinting
from the armour of those walking atop the battlements.

{CA Creaky But Sturdy Bridge{x~
This is an old and creaky wooden bridge.  Despite its obvious age it is
sturdy and could probably hold the weight of a large force crossing from or
into the keep.  To the west the Knights High Road stretches off before you
whilst to the east stand the mighty gates of Vingaard Keep.  The stonework
around the gate is littered with small arrow slits and observation holes
whilst the gates themselves look strong and sturdy.  Above the gates the
gleaming tips of the portcullis can be seen.  It appears that when the keep
is on alert it would be very difficult to gain entry into the keep.  A small
path leads down to a dry patch of the moat.

This large and open room is the gatehouse of Vingaard Keep.  There are
massive thick stone walls either side of you lined with arrow slits and
murder holes.  The massive gates stand tall and defiantly to the west while
a large courtyard opens out to the east.  Above the entrance to the
courtyard the tips of another portcullis can be seen.  It seems that in the

{CThe Eastern Courtyard{x~
Here the spacious eastern courtyard of Vingaard Keep ends abruptly.  The
way north is blocked by a large and fearsome looking tower covered in the
same thick ivy as the walls of the keep itself.  Whilst the ivy looks thick
and inviting closer inspection shows it to be brittle and covered with
hidden thorns making the walls unscaleable.  The courtyard continues to the
south and to the east.

{CUpon the Eastern Battlements{x~
The eastern wall is the least fortified of the four walls surrounding the
keep.  The view looks out onto the west bank of the Vingaard River as it
flows north on its way to the sea.  Any ground attack from this direction
would be slowed down by the river crossing giving the keep's defenders
enough time to pick off the marauders with their skilled bowmen.  The
battlements continue to the north while a heavy wooden door is set in the
wall of a mighty tower to the south.

look out over the river and the plains beyond to the east.  From here any
attackers or suspicious looking boatmen on the river can be covered by the
knight's archers.  A hall in the tower opens out to the west while a spiral

set into the northern and the western walls of the tower watching over the
appropriate courtyard.  Should the keep be attacked then attackers in the
courtyards can be picked off by archers from here.  The tower continues to

The southern battlements are reasonably fortified and well defended.  The
view to the south reveals that a full-scale assault is not likely on this
wall since the proximity of the Vingaard river makes it difficult for armies
to approach and assemble into ranks.  Defenders of this wall are more likely
to be asked to defend against a flanking attack.  A heavyset wooden door is

{CAtop the Southeastern Tower{x~
Here high above the plains watchmen and troops can see all around
Vingaard Keep.  The flat stone roof of the southeast tower is protected by
large battlements that troops can take cover behind should they need to. 
Longbowmen can be brought up here to fire volleys of arrows down upon the
southern plains should the keep be attacked by enemies.  The rooftop
continues to the north and to the east.

Here on the roof of the mighty southeast tower of Vingaard Keep the wind
howls through the battlements and swirls around the roof.  Lookouts and
watchmen are often assigned here to watch over the plains to the south and
the river and plains beyond to the east.  Archers can be deployed here to
fire volleys of arrows down onto attacking forces.  The rooftop continues to

{GA Dry Patch in the Moat{x~
This area of the moat is raised above the level of the murky water that
lies to the north and to the south.  The murky waters are flowing from
beneath a large floodgate set into the banks of the moat.  The gate is
nowhere near its full height enabling the knights to flood this part of the
moat should the need arise.  The keep is built high up on a hill directly to
the east.  The hill is so steep that it is definitely unscaleable.  A patch
of the hill appears to be a slightly different color to the rest.

This tunnel runs underneath the walls of Vingaard Keep.  From the heavily
booted tracks on the floor of this tunnel it is obvious that a large bulk of
troops use this tunnel frequently.  The walls have been carved away in
places to follow the natural walls of the tunnel.  It seems a tunnel has
existed here long before the keep was built and it was merely widened to
serve the knight's purpose.  A stone door is set in the west while the
tunnel leads into a passageway to the east.

and the guards.  There is a small kitchen set up for servants to make their
own meals after they have finished their duties.  The huge kitchens continue

{YThe Armory{x~
This armory has the feel of a museum and not of a working armory.  The
suits of armor lining the walls and on display are pieces of antique dress
armor.  There are display cases all around the room filled with interesting
and beautifully crafted pieces.  The pieces that are out of display cases
are mounted on dummies in various positions of mock battle.  The armory
continues to the west whilst a set of double doors stand to the south.

the decorative armory seems to be focused on weapons.  There are ornate
swords and highly decorative axes lining the walls and mounted in display
cases.  Shields with the emblems of each of the orders of the knighthood
hang boldly on the walls surrounded by heraldic shields from notable
families in the area.  The armory continues to the east.

This vast room is the main library of Vingaard Keep.  Rows and rows of
books line the shelves along the walls and aisles.  The air is quiet and
still, the calming scent of books wafts through the air.  A sense of peace
washes over all that enter the library as the knowledge of the knights
stands before them.  A quick glance at an index card shows the library to
hold books on many subjects from the musings of warrior poets to theories
and thesis' of warcraft.  The library continues to the east.

This is the private chapel of the Lord of Vingaard.  It is still referred
to as the Grand Master's Chapel in honor of its function during the
ancestral days of the knighthood.  The room is filled with images of knights
that died in valor and images and statues of the three main gods associated
with the knights of Solamnia.  A statue of Habbakuk stands among images of
Knights of the Crown whilst the statue of Kiri-Jolith stands amongst his
knights of the Sword.  At the head altar a statue of Paladine stands proudly
among images of Knights of the Rose.

are all fully furnished with beds and a large chest and closet for personal
belongings.  Ceremonial armor is displayed in most of the rooms alongside
stands and racks for day-to-day armor and weapons.  The only exit is to the

The Squires Quarters~
This room houses the squires and servants that serve on this floor of the
keep.  There are small bunks and bedrolls arranged in neat rows here, each
accompanied with a small chest for personal possessions and spaces where the
squire can work at polishing his master's armor.  The quality of the armor
being worked on and the emblems on the squire's chests indicate that these
are the squires of the Knights of the Rose and in some cases the Lord of
Vingaard himself.  The only exit is through the wooden door to the north.
