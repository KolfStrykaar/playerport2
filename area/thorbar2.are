black of his youth.

book~
Lord Soth was a Knight of the Rose, one of the highest of his order.  One
day while riding, he passed a caravan of elven clerics, and fell in love
with a young initiate.  Soth murdered his wife and married the elf maiden,
who learned of his treachery.  She prayed to Paladine on Soth's behalf, and
learned of the Cataclysm.  She also learned that Soth could prevent it from
happening if he rode to Istar, but he would be killed in the act.  Soth rode
to Istar to redeem himself, but came again on the elven clerics, who tricked
him into believing that his new wife -- now pregnant -- was cheating on him.
In a jealous rage, he rode home to kill her, arriving at the moment that the
Fiery Mountain struck Krynn, killing his wife and child -- but not before
she placed a curse on him.  Lord Soth now roams Krynn as a Death Knight; his
men at arms are now a legion of undead warriors, and the elven clerics are
banshees that sing his lament to him every night.  Soth served the Blue
Lady, Kitiara, and strives to entrap her soul as his wife for eternity, but
has not succeeded -- yet.

A conjoining tunnel~
You find yourself traveling down a hollowed out tunnel.  These tunnels
were dug out long ago for the simple purpose of connecting the segregated
clan cities within Thorbardin.  The lack of torches creates total darkness,
forcing one to use his or her own source of light.  With sharp rocks poking
out of the walls, it's obvious these tunnels were crudely dug, with the lack
of safety in mind.  As you continue on, you come to notice that none of
these tunnels have any significant difference from each other.

East Warrens~
Waves of gold flow all around as you appear to be surrounded by an
enormous field of wheat and grain.  The natural vents in the mountain blow
across the crops, giving off the illusion of a giant sea of gold encased in
this stone burrow.  Some billows of wheat can be seen among the crops,
waiting to be collected and used for bread and other foodstuffs.

East Warrens~
You find yourself in a large, open area, carefully dug out of the
mountain by the dwarves for farming use.  Before the Cataclysm, most of the
food production of the mountain was done outside.  However, with the closing
of the gates, Thorbardin was forced to move its farming practices
underground.  Using considerable experimentation, they have found several
crops which not only grow without need of the sun, but are also abundant
enough to sustain the entire mountain.  With a drier soil, the East Warrens
grow the stronger stalk crops and low-water survivors, including wheat,
corn, and potatoes.

East Warrens~
Waves of gold flow all around as you appear to be surrounded by an
enormous field of wheat and grain.  The natural vents in the mountain blow
across the crops, giving off the illusion of a giant sea of gold encased in
this stone burrow.  Some billows of wheat can be seen among the crops,
waiting to be collected and used for bread and other foodstuffs.  To the
north, you see a large structure built into the side of the wall.

The Mill~
The walls of this room are lined with barrels filled with grain,
obviously the storage area for the mill.  All the barrels appear to be
marked with a set of serial numbers, denoting the location in Thorbardin
where they are to be delivered.  Several dwarves with clipboards are here,
cataloguing the barrels and marking them accordingly.

The Mill~
You are nearly deafened as you walk into the main grinding area of the
mill.  This room is filled with a series of machines designed to grind down
the wheat into the grain needed to feed Thorbardin.  Several dwarves are
here, feeding stalks into the machine, and collecting the grain coming out
of the other end.

East Warrens~
You find yourself in a large, open area, carefully dug out of the
mountain by the dwarves for farming use.  Before the Cataclysm, most of the
food production of the mountain was done outside.  However, with the closing
of the gates, Thorbardin was forced to move its farming practices
underground.  Using considerable experimentation, they have found several
crops which not only grow without need of the sun, but are also abundant
enough to sustain the entire mountain.  With a drier soil, the East Warrens
grow the stronger stalk crops and low-water survivors, including wheat,
corn, and potatoes.

A soft breeze blows across your face as you enter this large orchard,
containing a wide variety of fruit trees.  Moving carefully, so not to step
on any of the assorted fruit scattered along the ground, you witness the
many dwarven farmers scanning the trees and picking the ripened fruit.  The
more abundant fruits appear to be strange hybrids of apples, pears, and
cherries, giving the orchard a wild blend of colors and smells.  Above you,
large vents open from the ceiling, delivering both a light air current, as
well as some misty precipitation from the underground streams.

North Warrens~
With only a minimal amount of irrigation and receiving the most amount of
wind from the natural vents in the ceiling, this area of the North Warrens
is perfect for growing some of the stronger surviving crops, including some
nut trees and banana trees.

Storage Shack~
Entering the large building, you are confronted with stacks and stacks of
crates containing considerable amounts of produce from the orchards. 
Carefully boxed and marked for shipping to all the cities in the mountain,
this produce will be used to feed the dwarves from every part of Thorbardin.
Several farmers can be seen wandering through the stacks, counting and
preparing the crates for transport.

outline of a small doorway can be seen lying directly to the south.  Perhaps
it may lead into some sort of secret tunnel, or worse, a fatal dead end.

North Warrens~
You find yourself in a large, open area, carefully dug out of the
mountain by the dwarves for farming use.  Before the Cataclysm, most of the
food production of the mountain was done outside.  However, with the closing
of the gates, Thorbardin was forced to move its farming practices
underground.  Using considerable experimentation, they have found several
crops which not only grow without need of the sun, but are also abundant
enough to sustain the entire mountain.  Utilizing the natural runoffs from
the outside of the mountain, the North Warrens contain a bizarre orchard of
fruit and nut trees which are able to survive underground.

Through the dark tunnels of Thorbardin, you stumble upon the entrance to
the South Hall of Justice, the building from which the laws of the mountain
are carried out.  Before you stands a large administrative building, which
houses the courts and magistrates who maintain the southern cities.  The
building appears to have been carved out of a large stalactite stretching
down from the ceiling.  Around the perimeter of the building is a large
roundabout, where armed guards are watching everyone walking around or
entering the Hall.  Aside from being the main judicial office on this side
of the mountain, this is also the second line of defense from outside
invasion.

This austere cavern is home to the Hall of Records, where a listing of
every dwarven citizen and outsider alike is recorded.  The names of every
resident of every warren in the underground kingdom enables both efficient
city planning and a means for the dwarven thanes to keep a close eye on
their subjects.  An orderly stack of parchments sits atop the stone counter,
containing birth certificates, death notices and applications for asylum
within the underground kingdom.

who devote their lives to the safety of Thorbardin.

Walking up to an intersection in the road, your path now divides into
three directions.  To the south, a smooth path stretches on, well lit by
many torches lining the walls.  Heading east will bring you deeper into this
fortress, like city and going north heads up Hylar street.  A few weapons, as
well as other well-crafted items, hang upon the walls, giving it a glorious
look as if in a war room.

glowing globe is embedded in the ceiling, lighting the street.  Along each
wall every few paces stands a wood or iron support beam.  Along the ceiling
bars connect the supports.  You can see to either end of the street.

Eastern entrance to the Valley of Thanes~
Here you find yourself standing at the eastern entrance into one of the
Hylar cities known as the Valley of Thanes.  This valley consists mainly of
Hylar Dwarves.  Skilled in battle and defenses, this large area was dug out
for the Hylar so they would have a place for them to better train their
defenses and house the many dwarves who devote their lives to the safety of
Thorbardin.

not surprising considering its inhabitants.  The street continues on to the
north and to the south, leading to other parts of this large valley.

An intersection in the road comes into view.  The road continues on to
the east and west, but also heads south, where an odd aroma seems to be
making its way towards you.  An ear piercing clanking sound can also be
heard coming from the same direction.  What could possibly be going on is a
mystery all in itself.

The black opal walls appear to be much wider down this cavernous street
than most others you've walked upon.  Although now you have much more
breathing room, almost enough for two minotaur to walk along here side by
side, the ceiling is almost painfully low.  Where it would be a perfect
height for a dwarf, it would force anyone taller to hunch over to get
through without bumping their head.

heavily fortified with burning torches and long spears.  The road appears to
have recently been swept, as you find it to be very, unnaturally clean.  The
path continues to stretch on to the south and to the north.

A wide corridor~
You find yourself walking down an unusual wide corridor.  The walls are
of black marble and have been polished smooth to give it a beautiful luster.
The light coming from the torches and reflecting of the walls, is almost
blinding.  From the south, an odd odor can be detected, however too faint to
make out.  An ear piercing sound can also be heard coming from the same
direction.

A wide corridor~
You have come to an intersection in a wide corner.  All sorts of smells
and sounds invade your senses as you stop to observe your surroundings.  To
the east, a foul and putrid smell appears to be lurking out of some sort of
Barracks.  From the west, an even more disturbing smell fills your nostrils
and to the south, metal clashing with metal hits your ears at an almost
deafening decibel.

The Stone Barracks~
Stacked ten high and ten across, bunks line the walls, giving this room
an adequate amount of room to house a full dwarven army if need be.  The
distinct smell of dirty feet and sweat lingers in the air.  The room appears
to be empty, the only sing of life coming from one small lantern still
glowing in the back of the room.  Perhaps it would be best to leave before
the trainees come back to find someone else sleeping in their bed.

The Galley of Thanes~
An overpowering smell of fried onions and dwarf spirits completely fill
the room, almost enough to make one's eyes tear up. Towards the back of
the room stands a large dwarf with some sort of white hat on, serving up
some sort of "slop" and slapping it down on each tray that passes him by. 
The smell alone is strong enough to knock out an ogre, let alone having to
see it.  If you’re hungry enough, perhaps a clothespin over the nose would
ease the chow down your throat.  What’s even more disturbing, is that he's
actually selling this stuff and not giving it away.

Koinus's House of Pain~
You find yourself standing right in the middle of some sort of training
room.  A place where the Hylar Dwarves, those whom seek out to become one of
the elite guards of Thorbardin, come to train and enhance their war fighting
skills.  The room is well lit with many torches hanging on the walls.  Along
side the torches, weapons and armor of many types have been placed in a neat
and orderly fashion.  The floor is made of hard marble, odd for being a
training room, but perhaps the pain which comes from taking a fall,
strengthens the body, rather than weakening it.

wall.  The other walls are laden with metal items, tools and implements and
merchandise.  Several forges and anvils dot the room; some have glowing
pieces of iron or bronze cooling atop them.  A large stone block shoved into
a corner has a sign affixed to it.

The main room of the general store is a low, dark place, poorly lit and
poorly arranged.  Shelves and racks stand at inopportune and awkward angles,
blocking walkways and cramping spaces.  Several seem ready to fall over; not
from too much merchandise, but from poor construction.  A dusty counter
lines half of the back wall.  A small wooden sign stands on the counter,
leaning to one side and in danger of falling off.

they each bear the weight of the earth above them on their shoulders.  A low
wooden counter occupies a small portion of the wall near the entrance.  A
neatly handwritten sign stands on the counter.

Diamond Road~
This road seems to sparkle as if it is paved in diamonds.  In all
actuality, it is constructed of a clear crystal that resembles the gemstone.
Somehow, the architects of Thorbardin designed this road so that it looks
completely natural here in the middle of all this natural wonder.

In the center of the room is a raised platform bearing an alter of gray

is flanked by twin braziers burning incense to the one God of neutrality the
Dwarves love most, Reorx.

He sits on a small black iron safe, with one arm rested on a knee and the
other carefully appraising the coins he has received for the day.  As he
notices your approach, he swings off the safe and quite literally bellies up
to the counter.  As you look over his proud weapons, you hear the chattering
of a young kender being thrown out of the store.

to guide themselves through the large outside world.  For now, you are safe
and at ease, yet you cannot forget what dangers unknown may lurk outside
this haven.  To the west, a small road leads through the glade where new
adventurers will learn how to survive.  A place where the bloody hunting
grounds awaits those who seek greater dangers

Inside a Secret Tunnel~
You find yourself inside a dark, damp tunnel.  Your own light source
appears to be the only thing lighting up your surroundings.  This tunnel
appears to have been dug out a long time ago, given that the rock appears to
be worn smooth from age.  Taking a close look at the walls, they appear to
be composed of graphite or some other kind black ore.  Large cobwebs litter
the corners where the ceiling meets the side walls.  Perhaps it would be
best to continue on.  The tunnel bends around a smooth corner, leading east
and north.

Intersection deep with-in a Secret Tunnel~
You come to an intersection in this vast secret tunnel.  Looking up, the
ceiling appears to have no end, as if reaching up to the heavens.  The main
direction of travel leads north and south.  Two paths branch off leading
east and west.  An odd odor lingers in the air, almost resembling that of
sulfur.  The darkness surrounding you almost seems to devour your own source
of light.  Unfortunately, no torches or any other means of light fill these
tunnels to aid you in making out your surroundings.

A dead end~
You find yourself standing at a dead end.  With the amount of rubble
lying on the ground before your feet, it appears the Dwarven tunnel miners
stopped digging here, leaving some of their mining tools scattered about. 
The only thing to do is to turn around and head back in the opposite
direction in which you came here.

A branched off tunnel~
This tunnel branches off the main path, leading west.  Going east will
take you back to the secret tunnel's main drag.  This separate tunnel has
obviously been dug out in thinking that only Dwarves would ever walk down
here, with the walls being very close together and the ceiling only standing
a mere five paces high.

A conjoining tunnel~
You find yourself traveling down a hollowed out tunnel.  These tunnels
were dug out long ago for the simple purpose of connecting the segregated
clan cities within Thorbardin.  The lack of torches creates total darkness,
forcing one to use his or her own source of light.  With sharp rocks poking
out of the walls, it's obvious these tunnels were crudely dug, with the lack
of safety in mind.  As you continue on, you come to notice that none of
these tunnels have any significant difference from each other.

Parameter Tunnel~
These damp corridors provide the defensive parameter for the North Hall

of Justice, and are constantly patrolled by roaming guards.  Because an
underground river flows just above the ceiling, water is constantly leaking
down the walls and creating a thick, humid air.  The tunnels are also quite

Entrance to the North Hall of Justice~
As you move through the low ceiling tunnels of the mountain, you find
yourself in a slightly larger tunnel system, with what appears to be a
building carved out of the rock itself.  Although not as elegant as some of
the buildings in the mountain, the North Hall of Justice was definitely of
dwarven design and craftsmanship.  This building handles many of the legal
disputes for both the northern cities and labor disputes in the warrens. 
Along with its judicial duties, the North Hall of Justice is also the second
line of defense for the mountain if the North Gate falls.  All along these
tunnels, guards can be seen patrolling the parameter.  To the south is a

door, leading into the Hall.

ruled over the years, including some depictions of several dwarven legends.

The Main Lobby~
One of the few areas in the Hall that is kept clean, this enormous lobby
seems to be made completely out of white marble.  Completely devoid of even
a scrap of paper, it would appear that this room is the main focus of the
janitors and maids when it is time to clean.  Aside from a few sculptures
and benches, the lobby appears pretty plain.  Several groups of people can
be seen here, either discussing an upcoming court appearance or just finding
a quiet place to chat.

Looking like a continuation of the office outside, the courtroom walls
are also lined with miscellaneous stacks of court papers and transcripts
which appear to be heavily covered in dust.  The only open spaces in this
large room are near the bench of the judge and the box for the defendant. 
Although court is not currently in session, several dwarves in fine clothes
can be seen wandering around and discussing cases.

Filled nearly to the ceiling with boxes and stacks of paperwork, this is
the office of the court secretary.  Although the South Hall of Justice does
not have the traffic that most of the courts of the mountain do, it
certainly makes up with its lack of organization.  Given the way the
paperwork is arranged in the room, the desk of the secretary appears to be
near the door to the north.

of Justice, and are constantly patrolled by roaming guards.  Because an
underground river flows just above the ceiling, water is constantly leaking
down the walls and creating a thick, humid air.  The tunnels are also quite
small, being just wide enough to allow weapons to swing properly.

The docking yards of the Life Tree are filled with merchant vessels which
transport supplies and people across the Urkhan Sea to the monstrous
stalactite before you.  Among the ships are some of the most dirty and rough
dwarves you'll ever meet in the mountain.  You currently stand on the Great
Lift, an elevation device which can take a person through the Life Tree to
any of the twenty-eight levels.  Aside from people, the Lift also transports
the many supplies brought across the Sea to the occupants of this giant
hanging rock.

here, buying supplies and food for their homes.  This Commons area appears
to be a giant bazaar and merchant level, where wandering peddlers can sell
their wares next to the age-old shops of the Life Tree's resident merchants.

Carved completely out of the natural granite stone of the mountain, this

abilities of dwarven craftsmanship.  Although not very flashy, the temple
possesses very intricate impressions in the stone, all praising the survival

square stone in the center of this temple, with a few words etched onto it.

stone~
Although not standing out with elaborate detail, rather a simple square
stone carved from marble, it is a symbol of devotion to the great Reorx.  A
reminder that all things created from stone, have a beggining state of form.
The stone is a simple square, standing approximately ten feet high, four
feet wide and about a foot thick.  It has been polished however, to at least
give it some kind of life, and the edges have all been rounded and smoothed.
It is made up of pure marble, with swirling colors of grey, white and black.
Directly in the center of the stone, some writing has been etched in.  It
reads - 
 
'For those who require my assistance, call for me with these words, and thou shall
 recieve'
 
{x                     By Reorx's Hammer, I shall never give up!

obvious display of the professionalism and faith of the great healer of the

around, there is a wondrous bouquet of scents permeating the room, giving
off a very relaxing sensation.

Small Bedroom~
This small room appears to be the perfect place to rest for the next
campaign.  Despite the rather simple decorations in the room, a strong sense
of peace and comfort flows through you.  In fact, you are starting to get...
really...sle....ppy....Zzzzzzzzzz...

The Seminary~
Although not as warm as most of the buildings on this floor, a strange
peacefulness passes over you as you enter the Seminary, a place for aspiring
priests to gain the skills and faith needed to make their way through this
troubled world.  With an almost divine craftsmanship, the building has been
carefully carved out of the very rock of the Life Tree.  Completely smooth
and decorated with intricate carvings of the gods, this granite room holds
some of the finest in dwarven sculpture and art.  A stone staircase leads up
into the major academic areas of the school.

The Sanctuary~
The upper floors of this school are the training and prayer rooms for the
development of a priest’s skills.  A small altar sits against the north wall
of the room, where several priests are praying for guidance.  There are also
some small desks positioned along the side walls, where aspiring clerics are
studying their spells and history.

The beginning and end of the Beast Pit~
Here is where the ancient Beast Pit begins and ends.  Nothing seems
familiar here, even the possible guidance of the heavens is denied to you by
the thick ceiling of gnarled vegetation.  You feel the land trying to grasp
ahold of your sanity as you trek through this pit, trying to find something
besides the endless cavern walls.  The Beast Pit continues on to the east. 
To the west, lies a completely different path.

Beast Pit~
You are treading deep within the Beast Pit.  Nothing seems familiar here,
even the possible guidance of the heavens is denied to you by the thick
ceiling of gnarled vegetation.  The constant buzz of insects grows louder. 
Darkness, twisted and contorted trees, and the sludge beneath your feet is
all you have to orient yourself.  Backwards, leftwards, upwards, rightwards.

Beast Pit~
The beast pit is very cramped, barely wide enough to accommodate a
kender.  The ceiling is only a few hands above your head; you can reach up
and place your palm flat against it.  The floor is littered with loose
stones and sand, making one's footing, treacherous.  Animal noises can be
heard throughout the cavernous pit.

The floor is littered with loose stones and sand, making one's footing,
treacherous.  To the north, it appears to become more easier to walk, as the
loose stones turn into tightly fitted large stones.  To the east, the Beast
Pit continues on, leading into darkness and unknown atmospheres.  The sounds
of a bustling market seem to make their way towards you, also coming from a

Intersection of a muddy street~
You stand on a broad road, the quality of which is very impressive. 
Though it is obviously old, it is graded and well paved with stones that
have been fit closely together.  No one in these parts knows who built the
road, though most attribute it to an ancient kingdom which once spanned all
of Thorbardin.  The street continues on to the north and south, with another
street branching off to the west.  The sound of metal being hammered into
shapes can be heard coming out of a doorway to your east.  A sign hangs
directly above the open door.

Reorx's Forged Shields~
Large and small, round and square, shields of all types line the walls
surrounding you as you find yourself inside Thorbardin's Shield Armoury. 
Towards the back, an older dwarf pounds away on an anvil, forging a piece of
metal into a great shield.  The room is hot with the large bellow keeping
the fire going at an extreme temperature.  A large gold safe imposes that
these shields aren't just for show, but for sale.

Before the Throne Room~
Two large marble pillars lie directly to the south.  A large gate lies
open, inviting all into where ever it may lead.  A gold carpet lying
directly at its entrance and leading inwards, would imply a throne room of
some sort.  Looking around, one would find themselves standing on a broad
road, the quality of which is very impressive.  Though it is obviously old,
it is graded and well paved with stones that have been fit closely together.
No one in these parts knows who built the road, though most attribute it to

ceiling are elaborately sculpted, having intricate geometric and foliated
patterns incised upon them.  To the rear of this elaborately built room,

Roil Street~
You stand on a broad road, the quality of which is very impressive. 
Though it is obviously old, it is graded and well paved with stones that
have been fit closely together.  No one in these parts knows who built the
road, though most attribute it to an ancient kingdom which once spanned all
of Thorbardin.  A separate road breaks off leading to the west, down to
separate part of the city.

Market Square~
You stand in the middle of an EXTREMELY large Market Square.  The ground
here has seen much use at the hands of the military, it has been worn a good
six inches below the rest if the square.  A giant black archway towers above
you to the north.

The Training Quarters~
You find yourself in a fairly large room, walls completely filled with
weapons, armor and paintings depicting great battles between dwarves and
other races.  Here is where many dwarves come to hone their training in
order to become better fighters, in hopes to defend their great Kingdom,
Thorbardin.

Diamond Road~
This road seems to sparkle as if it is paved in diamonds.  In all
actuality, it is constructed of a clear crystal that resembles the gemstone.
Somehow, the architects of Thorbardin designed this road so that it looks
completely natural here in the middle of all this natural wonder.  The road
continues around a bend, heading north and east.

The Satrap's Road~
The Satrap's Road is an old construction, built many hundreds of years
ago.  It's made of wide, flat, red blocks.  The road is wide enough for
several carts to drive side by side.  The sound of hammering metal grows
louder to the north and to the east, the sounds of laughter can be heard
ringing through the air like a large bell.

The Armoury Depot~
The sound of hammering metal grows louder as you enter the armoury. 
Young boys run to and fro carrying buckets of water and coal.  A few dwarves
work on sections of armor in the back of the shop, their hammers working too
fast to follow.  The walls are adorned with all of Gosur's prize creations. 
Here you can purchase suits of armor meant to protect you in those
dangerous situations you seem to keep getting into.  A note sits propped up
on a counter.

E
note~
LIST  : gives you a list of items for sale.
VALUE : tells you how much an item is worth to Gosur

East Sator Drive~
You find yourself standing at the end of a small street.  To the north
lies an elixir shop, where as to the east, lies the great Tavern of the Nine
Drawn Axes.  Pandemonium.  Chaos.  Madness.  A few other choice words come
to mind as you gaze into this corner of the market.  The cavernous walls
surrounding you have been polished to give it an eerie luster.  Perhaps a
quick stop in the Tavern will clear things up.

The Tavern of the Nine Drawn Axes~
Loud raucous laughter, the pounding of feet and swirling music drown out
any attempts at conversation.  Low tables surround a cleared space at the
center of the tavern.  On the back wall above the bar is a starburst pattern
made by nine axes, hilts together, that fans out in a circle.  Almost
everyone in here wears an axe or a blade of some kind.  Warriors and others
of the martial persuasion swill wine and ale or devour the food set before
them by serving girls.

The Scrollin' Potion~
You enter a shop crowded with bookshelves and cluttered with scrolls. 
The shelves are packed with many strange items, including animal skeletons
in jars and unidentifiable things trapped inside clear rocks.  The owner
seems hard at work on his latest magical creation.  You can't really tell
what it is because of all the smoke rising from it, and from the fact that
it's shaking very violently.  A thin chittering sound echoes occasionally
through the store.  There is a small hand-written sign on the wall.

sign~

A conjoining tunnel~
You find yourself traveling down a hollowed out tunnel.  These tunnels
were dug out long ago for the simple purpose of connecting the segregated
clan cities within Thorbardin.  The lack of torches creates total darkness,
forcing one to use his or her own source of light.  With sharp rocks poking
out of the walls, it's obvious these tunnels were crudely dug, with the lack
of safety in mind.  As you continue on, you come to notice that none of
these tunnels have any significant difference from each other.
