A chillness sweeps over anything that swims too far from the warmth of
the volcanic vents.  Though the vents give off heat, they also give off
toxic fumes that could be deadly if one is not adapted to them.  Crustaceans
and small fish swim eagerly around, picking off the dying and the young.  A
pack of barracuda swim overhead, eyeing the situation.

A small kelp leaf floats by slowly, looking ripped and torn.  A quick
glance shows that a plant has fallen victim to a vicious attack, by a large
fish, still in the area.  The fish, after the shrimp crawling around the
stalks, used it shear force to get the shrimp, and in the process, destroyed
a small kelp plant.

Larger fish swim alone, looking for food to eat and a way out.  The coral
only appears to grow so high to keep the fish in, leaving water above the
means of an easy escape.  With a spurt of energy it heads upward, only to be
thrown back to the sandy bottom, wish such force, it dies instantly.  There
appears to be no way for the fish to escape once they are in.

Larger fish swim alone, looking for food to eat and a way out.  The coral
only appears to grow so high to keep the fish in, leaving water above the

thrown back to the sandy bottom, wish such force, it dies instantly.  There
appears to be no way for the fish to escape once they are in.

only appears to grow so high to keep the fish in, leaving water above the

thrown back to the sandy bottom, wish such force, it dies instantly.  There

A large shark swims swiftly over head.  Once it passes a good distance
from the walkway it slows down to a slower pace.  The unearthly feel of the
walkway looms, while the mountain keeps it presence known at all times.  A
small kelp plant stands eerily silent in an unmoving lifeless form.

A couple small kelp plants lay scattered along the walkway.  Large
boulders rest solidly on either side, making the walkway look menacing and
isolated.  No fish swim along the path giving the walking an almost lifeless
feel.

The dark sand that makes up the walkway looks as though its firmly
planted in place.  There are no loose grains of sand in the water, no
movement from it at all.  The boulders that line the walkway are scarce of
any living creatures, only an out of place kelp plant give the area the life
it so needs.

In the far distance a large rock formation can be seen.  It looms over
the lifeless pathway, like a vulture over a corpse.  Perhaps the reason for
no fish around here could be because of this very under Sea Mountain?  For
any reason, the mountain, lets its presence known and hovers over all.

A loud clicking noise echoes in the water.  A large wall runs along the
side of the mountain in the distance.  Are those people working on the wall?
The still walkway leads to the mountain, making it feel more and more
unnerving.

A set of stairs, cut out from the very mountain, rise up from the water,
to a well worn floor.  A few puddles have formed from people leaving the
water, after working on the massive wall that runs along side of the
mountain.  The water from which everyone emerges has an odd stillness to it,
giving the entrance an ominous feeling about it.

A small fire pit is in the middle of the room, while a few large barrels
lay close to the wall, upright and covered.  A few blankets are close to the
rim of the fire pit, while balled up cloth is on one end of the blanket,
more than likely used as pillows.  The fire pit is free of any wood or
anything else that looks as though it could be burned, yet it is quite
obvious that is has been used recently.

cave, giving the impression even more, that a large creature has done this.

The floor is full of slime, making it hard to walk along.  If one were to
try and grab the wall for support, they would do nothing more than slide
down it, for it too is full of slime.  The air down in the many tunnels has
a slight warmness to them, though no signs of any heat source.  The area
surrounding this cannot be seen, the only light that comes from anywhere, is
what brave adventurer has brought with them.

glistening slime adorns the walls, while broken shells of crustaceans litter

The walls inside this large cave are jagged and torn.  Boulders line the
floor, along with many bones.  Some have been pulverized into nothing but
dust, while others have been unmoved from the very rock that took their
life.  Though the rest of the caves have warmth to them, this one has a
coolness about it, which could make even the most wizened person feel
uncomfortable.

Large boulders are scattered about, making it hard to get around. 
Climbing and walking over the boulders prove to be a difficult task since
most are butted up against each other and full of slime, allowing hardly any
room to maneuver through them or over them.  A few have some gashes taken
out of them.  There must be something down here in the dark depths of the
tunnels that has strength enough to harm solid rock.

float through the water, cutting anything they can in their way.  A small
anemone's arms are forced into a ridged shake from the slight whirlpool that

Tiny crustacean and shrimp have made their home around it, and a few small
springs of coral are growing from the jagged ends of the wood.  New life is

Broken muscles shells litter the sea floor.  Dozens of small crabs climb
the many muscle encrusted rocks, snipping and cracking shells to get at the
meat inside.  Small shrimp scurry among the shells looking for any uneaten

Finely trimmed kelp stalks move in a ghostly fashion.  It's obvious this
area has been harvested for reason unknown.  Perhaps the leaves were a
perfect thickness for clothes?  Or perhaps the leaves where tender enough
for food.  For unknown reasons, it has been done, yet the wall of the thick
kelp still remains as interference for passing.

Tiny crustacean and shrimp have made their home around it, and a few small

A large shadow moves slowly over the area.  Over head a huge manta ray
glides rhythmically through the water, casting its shadow over where it
swims.  The thick massive stalks of kelp move jaggedly about, from the many
fish swimming through from an unseen predator.  A small starfish clings to a
rock on the floor bottom, moving at its own graceful pace.

A few enormous boulders jut up from the ground in a beautiful spectacle. 
A few hundred tiny muscles cling to the boulders, filtering the food from
the water for nourishment.  A dozen tiny shrimp walk along the kelp stalks,
cleaning it for food while a few somewhat large fish dart in and out of the
kelp, attracted to the shrimp.

Broken muscles shells litter the sea floor.  Dozens of small crabs climb
the many muscle encrusted rocks, snipping and cracking shells to get at the
meat inside.  Small shrimp scurry among the shells looking for any uneaten
food, while fish chase the shrimp for sport.

Finely trimmed kelp stalks move in a ghostly fashion.  It's obvious this
area has been harvested for reason unknown.  Perhaps the leaves were a
perfect thickness for clothes?  Or perhaps the leaves where tender enough
for food.  For unknown reasons, it has been done, yet the wall of the thick
kelp still remains as interference for passing.

The current kicks up an undersea sand storm.  Tiny, razor sharp particles
float through the water, cutting anything they can in their way.  A small
anemone's arms are forced into a ridged shake from the slight whirlpool that
has formed, and the surrounding kelp only acts as walls to keep the
disturbance from growing.

A large chunk of wood appears to have found its way to the sea floor. 
Tiny crustacean and shrimp have made their home around it, and a few small

Massive kelp sways, schools of fish play, and a small starfish moves
slowly along the sea floor.  A pair of manta rays glides over head, in an
unearthly ease.  A large sea turtle pauses for a rest, while a few fish play
with a floating, broken kelp leaf.  Such is life at the bottom of the sea.

Deep green kelp sways back and forth in an untenable current.  Schools of
fish swim within the many leaves, scurrying about when larger fish come to
close.  A few leaves break off from the stalks of the kelp, falling slowly
but gracefully to the sandy bottom of the sea floor.

In all directions a wall of kelp seems to block the way onward.  A few
turtles easily maneuver their way through the impenetrable wall.  To do so
by another non-sea creature would be suicide.  Large schools of fish sweep
the sea floor, kicking up what little sand there is in this area.
