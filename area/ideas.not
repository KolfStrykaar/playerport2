Subject Roleplay~
Text
Just a thought about roleplaying. I haven't been around this Mud for long,
but I have found that roleplaying is quite a rewarding aspect of the game here.
When I say rewarding, I do not mean xp's wise, since there is no standard for winnig them.
I would suggest that people might gain xp's by interacting with other players in a similar as Blacksmiths do.
By time spent speaking with others. Or number of lines written to others.
I have been doing a lot of roleplaying lately, and I would be gainning a whole lot more xp's killing things.
That is, of course, unless a "Kindly God" notices me and decides to give me some.
I guess the fact that you would gain xp's just by speaking with others could be abused by certain players.
But then the "Gods" role would be just to monitor what they were saying and penalize them if they abused this.
It would be more motivating to see you could advance through Roleplay, and not just hack-&-slay.
And I've seen a lot of Roleplaying around here. That is one of the appeals of this Mud!
Just a thought. Gotrek the Warrior

Subject Blacksmith store fronts and warehouses~
Text
It's me again with another great idea. How about making a place where blacksmiths can come to show off their services. Perhaps a store situation. I always thought it would be cool to have my own shop to sell my services in. It could be in a new town or something or in Palanthus. Maybe the 'Smith Mall' or annexed to Smith Alley a 'Smithy' or a 'Blacksmith Guild' that would allow people to come in and buy services from a blacksmith. This way, everyone would know where to find a smith and each smith could ha
ve his or her own storefront.
 
Also, Blacksmiths should be able to store things in a warehouse situations. You should be able to deposit materials just like the bank situation. I think this would be really cool, cause then you don't have to donate you hard-earned materials because you need to carry more stuff.
This could be part of the same thing as my first idea.
 
Please listen. This is INGENIOUS!!!! hehehe. lol

OK, not sure what youve done about boats(if there still hand held objects
or not) but i got an idea.  A new item flag for builders called boats and a
new eq slot such as <captain of> and a boating skill.  Boats would have a
passenger limit meaning that if a boat could carry 3 people then the person
who has the boat and 2 people following could cross water with him/her. 
Different boats would have different passenger ratings and the boating skill
would be required (all mino's would have this skill).  Then people could
charge to ferry people across waters that normally would be unaccessable
without a fly spell.  Also was thinking of a shallow water room sector and a
swim skill for like rivers and lakes.

Okay I was thinking a bit and it seems like
your clan could have a bit spicing up. I mean
especially one that prides themselves on Roleplay
there should be a underlying backbone (Scuse the Pun).
I think the clan skills should be looked at a bit.
Black order gets Gaseous Form. That would have been
a perfect skill assigned to those of Vampire in our
Umm Your clan (Woops Freudian slip) I think what
form one takes should depend on class too. Lich
should be Necromancer. Mummy should be clerics. 
Bards should be Ghosts ect ect ect. Just to add
some flair to it.

To: immortal
Hey, 
Its all of you guys that check ideas's worst nightmare! im back with my millions of ideas.
and heres something i cant believe i never thought of earlier,
BOWS! as of now, they are farely pointless. no good bows, they dont do much damage,
certainly no more than a regular hit, and they are much slower, only one shot per round, or every
other round. Soo, im just addressing how if theres arrow deflection, maybe
we should do something to make bows used :P and let me think of someway to do that.
maybe you can add a targeting command that goes along with the bow skill.
you can target parts of someones body, and the bow will do different things. 
for example: maybe you can target legs, right arm, left arm, torso, head.
if you target someones legs, a hit there will slow them down, lowering dex,
by a good chunk id say. and create a loss of movement points.
a shot to the torso will do damage as its always done, tho maybe create more powerful
bows, or just make damage by an arrow BETTER than a regular weapon, since its slow, 
make it at least a possibilty to shoot for damage. left and right arm.
maybe that can have something to do with a persons weapon/shield or
weapon/weapon combo. perhapse, for now, as a basic, a right arm shot 
could cause a person to drop their primary weapon.
a left arm shot drop shield or secondary weapon.
 
i think this is a great idea, it will finally give those few classes who can use them
a real use for them. it will also give the deflect arrow skill a value, because
as of now, its close to pointless. It will give classes like rangers a real value in a group,
as a rare comodity. (sorry if i spelt that wrong.) thanks!

oh sorry, forgot head. 
targeting someones head would be a tricky thing. it would be a difficult  thing to hit
but if hit, either do massive ammounts of damage, or 1 hit kill (since i think an arrow to ANYONES head 
would hurt badly) but of course there are helmets. so maybe, when an arrow to the head actuallt hits,
it has a percentage to kill instantly, but otherwise just does terrible damage.
Thanks for listening :)

Akiran: Ranger skills
Tue Jan  3 12:51:40 2006
To: immortal
Here are a handfull of Ideas ive come up with over the months...
 
Craft Trap - Level 70
The art of setting traps is one of the greatest weapons
of any Ranger. It also goes hand in hand with the art
of creating the traps. More than aquestion of supplies, 
this skill is focused mainly on theingenious of the Ranger
crafting a trap. The more intelligent, the more effective 
the traps the Ranger mightbe able to come up with.
Craft Trap will allow a Ranger to create a trap, given
he is in a wooded area, for most of the supplies needed
can be found there. The higher the skill percentage, the
more likely the Ranger is to succeed in creating the trap
of choice. There are two types of traps he can create, one
being like an ordinary trap that a Ranger can buy at a
hunting or Ranger supply store that can be stored and set
upon need. The second kind is a trap that cannot be built
into a kit, and must be prepared and set on the spot. Though
this may be harder to use, these traps are hugely more effective.
Once a Ranger has practiced this skill, he can use it. When used,
by typing in "craft" or "crafttrap" a list will be displayed of
settable traps. The higher the intelligence of the Ranger, the
more traps that will be displayed under this list. Some traps
available:
Intelligence 10 - Trip Trap
-This is merely a rope stretched across a path, tripping anyone
to pass-
(This is a kit trap that when set will trip the victim and 
 lose them 50 movement points)
Itelligence 15 - Pit Fall
-Obviously, a covered pit that will cause the first person walking
by to fall in)
(This is a on-the-spot set trap that causes the victim to 
 be stunned for 1 tic and lose 75 movement points)
Intelligence 20 - Log Trap
-A log tied back, suspended from vines or rope. When tripped,
 the log is released, striking the victim-
 
(This would be a kit trap that when set will deal damage
 and cause the victim to fall to the ground losing 75 
 movement points)
Intelligence 25 - Spiked Pit Fall
-Just like the pit fall, except with spikes, ouch!-
(This is a on-the-spot set trap that causes the victim
 to be stunned for 1 tic, take moderate damage, and lose
 100 movement points)
Intelligence 30 - Fly Trap
-The Fly trap is a web of vines with heavy stones weaved into its  design. When tripped, the net swings down from above quickly and   strikes the victim from the front, causing them to become entangled-
(This is a kit trap that causes 300 movement points and trips the  victim)
Intelligence 35 - Hunters Net
-This is a trap designed to catch large and dangerous prey. It is a net
 that is hidden amongst the leaves and foliage on the ground, and when  victim is in the middle of it, the trap is tripped, raising the victim  up into  the trees, trapped-
(This is an on-the-spot trap that causes the victim to be "entangled"
 for 5 tics)
A new skill could be granted to all classes (or maybe just the stronger 
classes) called "Struggle". This skill will attempt to free the user when "entangled". This skills effectiveness is based on skill percentage and strength. Three successful attempts must be made before the "entangled" effect will be negated. This skill could begin at 50% for all fighter classes, and if given to mages, starting at 0%.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Woodland Healer - Level 50
As a survivalist, Rangers have gone further than any, except maybe the druid, in using the world around him or her to live and be healthy. It is second nature to a Ranger the right mixtures of plants to produce a salve or balm with healing properties. 
This skill is usable only in a wooded area. It can be used on himself or an ally. It will heal a small ammount, 50-100 hp, and cure poison and plague. The skill should take several seconds to work. 
Syntax: cure (or) heal <target>
<User name> begins mixing a healing balm from nearby plants.
(a few seconds)
<User name> applies a healing balm to <target>.
Alternative:
The Woodland Healer skill could have a different effect depending on where the Ranger is, in a swamp, forest, hills, ect. So depending on the avaialable plants, the Ranger can mix a different sort of salve or balm. It would be up to Ranger to learn what sort of effects the balm or salve will have depending on the terrain.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pivot Block - Level 75
The spear is an ideal hunting weapon, one Rangers have excelled in using. A particularly skilled Ranger has learnt to use the weapon in an effective defensive manner by using the spears long shaft to pivot quickly to either side of himself to avoide an attack.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Expert Markmanship - Level 60
Rangers being one of the few classes adept at using a bow has learned to be truly accurate with this ranged weapon, able to target the most vital locations of an enemy, inflicting much more damage when firing a bow. 
This skill is passive and acts like Enhanced Damage except exclusively for Bow weapons. Since bows do not do very good melee damage, this skill is most effective when using the "Fire" command.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Woodland Quiver - Level 35

Subject Improvements~
Text
My first thought of improvement would be to start players off with a map
of their hometown instead of palanthas which would obviously help to a
certain extent lowering the dependancy on palanthas(fountain room in
particular) as an rp room.  Second, since evil people are not allowed in or
around palanthas, perhaps some lower level mobs in and around neraka would
help keep evil characters away from there, other cities may need some as
well but I'm relatively new here and haven't had a chance to experience all
of them but palanthas seems to be the general area where most new characters
start off leveling outside of mud school.  And lastly regarding skills, a
massive intelligence score is necessary prac with any affectiveness, it
seems that eq to raise wisdom so a large number of pracs can be attained
each level has arrisen to counter act that...  So maybe some coding to alter
that?  As well, certain skills, atleast in my opinion would seem to be based
largely on other stats then intelligence, for example, dodge is more of
dexterity skill then an intelligence one, so also maybe some coding to make
it so that the rate at which the % increases when practiced would be based
on dex instead of intelligence and for other skills as well which are in a
similar situation.

Something along the lines of a paralyzing arrow. Said assassin shoots a player/npc with the arrow and until it's removed, "type rem arrow" the player is slowly paralyzed. With the initial hit, I would say 5 ticks of not being able to dodge hits during combat, and if left in, at the 0 tick mark they paralyze (stopping combat if there is any)
 
I would like to see more/better poison skills for assassins without necessarily being combat ones. This is an example.

I know you have all sorts of changes that you put in and you are
constantly busy.  But I was thinking maybe when you get the time you could
put in some eq that has the same stat bonuses with other things added or
something.  I mean you have 50 out of 51 characters using the same eq from
level 10 to level 80.  Just an idea.  Or maybe something like take out the
the stat bonus list in the identify thing.  Like leave the stuff like it
says its sharp or has a vampiric aura.  But take out the stat bonus stuff
cause people just run around and find the best stat eq and use None of the
other ones.  It would liven up the look perspective of the game and make
characters more unique i suppose anyway just an idea and i thought i would
pass it your way.

Subject Writing and Papermaking~
Text
So, I was trying to discover some cantrips on a slow evening the other day, and I decided to read the helpfile just for fun. And I read this: 
"Mages are known to keep written records of their favorite cantrips. If you find such a scroll..." It was then I realized it was a lie: we
currently cannot write on anything! The closest we get is the scribe spell, but that serves more a technical purpose than an RP one.
 
So I propose the {WWrite{x skill. It works much like scribe, but is a bit different; you have to hold the item you wish to write 
upon in your hands and type simply WRTIE <TEXT>. The language you are currently SPEAKING will be the language you write in.
Pretty simple, right?
To go along with this, I propose a {WPapermaking{x skill for Blacksmiths. This skill will allow them to, with the correct resources 
(like wood, reeds, papyrus, etc) to make the following items (from lowest level to highest): piece of paper, piece of parchment,
leaflet, flyer, poster, banner, scroll, invitation, broadsheet, manuscript, book, ledger, tome, spellbook.

Subject Doppelganger~
Text
I think that once an Illusionist reaches a certain level (say 80) they should be able to Doppelganger MOBs as long as the said MOBs are at 
least 20 levels lower than the mage. So a level 80 level Illusionist could doppel a beggar in Palanthas or anything level 60 and below. It 
could really spice up the RP! Perhaps, when doppel-izing a MOB, the said caster would not be able to cast other spells (except for maybe Dispel
Magic or Cancellation). What do you think?

Subject Conclave Skill: Declare~
Text
{YThe following is a mock "helpfile" on the Conclave skill {RDeclare{W
 
Syntax: Declare <victim> <Renegade>
 
What this will do is FLAG a person with the RENEGADE flag. This command may ONLY be used by members of the Conclave clan (reason being that they were the only ones who know whom practices High Sorcery within the Towers and do does not). Do not get out of hand flagging people.
Do not FLAG people just because they are mages but not members of the Conclave or because you dislike them for OOC reasons or because they did something to one of your Alts. DECLARE only works on MAGE type classes, as they are the only ones able to practice High Sorcery.
 
According to numerous sources on the web and in the Dragonlance books, "Renegades are individuals that have chosen to practice the art of 'High Sorcery' outside of the guidelines and law's laid down by the Orders of High Sorcery." The key words here being 'High Sorcery,' not mere 'Magic.'
 
High Sorcery is a much more powerful form of magic, that said, it would be suitable to say that any non-Conclavian mage over the level of 50 that is deemed a "threat" to the Conclave may be declared a renegade. Each Order of High Sorcery goes about dealing with renegades in different ways. You may find out more on this by reading HELP WHITE ROBES, HELP RED ROBES, and HELP BLACK ROBES.
 
 
As there is some grey area here (a level 100 mage who is a hermit and talks to himself may not be deemed a "threat to High Sorcery," and therefore would not be labeled a renegade, whereas a level 51 Necromancer who enjoyed terrorizing cities would be), it is very important that only the Leaders of the Conclave have access to this skill; if they are leading an Order of High Sorcery, they should at least have the RPing skills and level headedness (at least OOCly) to not abuse this skill.
 
It is recommended that the Conclave Wizards (the 6 High Mages of each Order plus the 3 Ordermasters) convene and have a formal judgment before declaring a mage a renegade to avoid any disagreement and dissent. If the renegade is a former-Conclave member, it is custom that their previous Order has the final say on their status as a renegade.

{YThe following is a mock helpfile on the Conclave skill: {RCapture{W

This command is given to all Wizards of High Sorcery. It is a command which will enable them to capture magi who are DECLARED a renegade. If successful, the victim will be sent off to the dungeon where they will await their punishment based on how large of a threat they pose to High Sorcery.
They will not be able to get out of jail until their sentence is up. This command is mostly level based, so for someone trying to apprehend a person who is higher level than they are, they won't be too successful. This is an alternate method of taking care of renegades, rather than just killing them. It gives a more realistic method of governing the world's practice of High Sorcery.
 
{YOOC note: The dungeon this file refers to are the cells beneath the Tower of Wayreth. I'm not sure how exactly the sentence lengths would work (as being a renegade isn't a 'crime' you merely serve a sentence for). But I'm hoping we could work something out either code or RP wise.{x

Players should be able to buy homes in the Residential District in Palanthas (and other cities as well). I single Palanthas out because it actually as a 'residential district.' I think that it would serve many purposes by filling it with 'plots' or rooms that characters can buy.
 
{WHELP HOME{x would display the following:
 
Players may purchase and develop property of their own to serve as their online home away from home.
 
The first step in this process is for the player to find a property that is for sale.  Such properties will typically include a message such as "This lot has a Fore Sale sign." After finding such a property, the player should enter LOOK SIGN to discover the properties unique lot number.
 
The next step is to find the local Property dealer for that area.  He shouldn't be too far away! When the property dealer is found, you can use your lot number to purchase the correct lot from the dealer.
 
Once the property is purchased, you will need to develop it. To do that, you may need the help of a friendly blacksmith who has the skill of Carpentry. Then you'll be able to pay them to redesc your room(s) and furnish it with everything that you need.

Subject jailing in general~
Text
Ok My last idea on jailing got shot down. a friend posted the idea for me and got back to me with the answer.  I said that the knights shouldnt be able to arrest you just by typing something in they should have to subdue you or something first. my friend was told think of it like if a knight and his wardens were the cops.  You are outnumbered and they would drag you to the grond and arrest you.
but I was just arrested by a knight who just happened to enter the game right next to me and before I could even type anything I was sent to jail....he had no wardens and I was just there all of the sudden.
so there is something to think over.  Also when I got there there was no exit.  There should at least be a way out even if it is hard as hell and you gotta have people bust into the solamnic headquarters and kill strong guards to get someon out.  Or if you pick the lock and try to escape and get caught it could add time on so maybe people wont try unless they are desperate.  And if you do successfully escape it adds a jail break flag to you. It would make the game more fun.
oh and of course if someone broke you out of jail they would need an rp reason of course.

Subject Bounty System.~
Text
Okay, here is my idea for a new bounty system.
The first thing that could be changed is.. how current/up to date it is. I see characters made years ago and have been deleted for SOME TIME now with bounties on their heads. The change would be: After a certain amount of time, the amount placed on the persons head will be taken off, as would their name, and put into a mercenary collected coffer. It could also be that mercenaries are the only ones who can COLLECT bounties.
 
Second thing.. character descriptions. When you place a bounty, you will have to write a description on the what the person looks like. The issue I see with that is just copying and pasting their description on there, so if regular people look at the bounties (I dunno, say.. mercenaries?) they can check and make sure that it is a detailed or vague description.
So if a bounty is placed on Kotoasa, you won't have to click enter like 5 times just to be done with the description, you would receive a character summary. Moving with character descriptions, it could also be made so that the bounty can only be raised up a certain amount before you have to go to another bounty collector in a city.
What is this for? It gives the possibility of messing up descriptions of the hunted, so if you are hunting Jack Smack, the blonde axe wielder, another city would call him Joe Shmo, the brunette swordmaster. This doesn't have to be considered, but it would give them an easier time I guess. :p
 
I think this would be a great way for legitimizing pk. Instead of seeing their name on the wholist, then on the bounty list, you don't get to just run after them and kill them, with no rp.

it would crumble/fall/sucumb to the changing of the

Subject Thief and Mercenary ability~
Text
Ok, I have a proposition for a dual-clan ability,
Since the steal skill really only belongs to
the Thief class, since they specilize in that,
i'd love to see some other ability given to
the Thief clan that can cause a player to 
lose items to another player, because if
a non thief wants to be in the Thieves guild,
they should have some means of scoring loot.
so here is goes, it would be an ability
that would allow the user to have a chance
to score random items or gold out of the
victims inventory. The ability can only be used
if the victim is sleeping, unconcious,
or immobile. If the person is voluntarily
sleeping, the skill, whether succesful or
not, has a pretty good chance of waking them up
(chance maybe dependent on the users skill proficiency).
I cant think of a good name for this ability though,
but it makes sense to me that it should not only be 
given to the Thieves but also Mercenaries, because
mercs are shady like that too.
The ability would have a pretty good lag-timer on
it, and certainly a longer lag-time for a failed attempt.
I think a person unconcious would be the easiest to
succeed on, followed by someone asleep, and lastly
(fairly difficult) on a person who is simply
incapable of moving.

LoK has more narrow areas.. or rather, narrow roads connecting wider areas together..
its not quite as important, because its pretty easy to get from Area to Area
here. Those maps are in muds that have wide wildernesses between towns and
areas of interest, so the map becomes very useful. Honestly, though, i'd love

It'd be cool to see more bonuses given to someonew

for one, to even just hit them. Maybe attacks VS
someone mounted in combat have a less chance to hit, unless
they are wielding a bow, spear, or polearm, or likewise,
any weapon with a fair amount of reach.
 
OR, a skill that can be used in conjunction
with mounted combat, that urges your mount
to lash out in whatever way it can (depending on the animal)
at whatever the rider is attacking.
 
OR, there are already mounts who attack in
combat, i think, like the warhorse that can be
purchased in palanthas. maybe a skill
that someone can use to TEACH any mountable
creature how to be a WAR MOUNT. Once taught,
the animal will either attack during combat,
or become better at attacking during combat.

Subject Skill idea: Transmute~
Text
Here's an idea for the Enchanter class. 
This skill would allow them to take two items,
and transmute one into the other. The 2nd
item would remain, while the first would 
dissapear. The 2nd would receive some or all
of the first items added stats (like STR,DEX
 Hitroll/Damage roll, etc)
naturally, there would be restrictions on this
skill, so as to not allow the creation of all
powerful items. Maybe an item can only receive
a transmution once. ya, that'd make sense.
if you tried to do it a 2nd time, it would 
explode from too much contained energy.

I had this idea last night as I was going to bed.
It would be a cool idea for the LoK mud client
your developing Hiddukel. This is what it would do:
it wold allow you to select a group of players in to
your "roleplaying group" and it would show a bar on
the side of the client screen with the names of the
players. ((oh, and this feature would only work
if everyone was using the LoK mud client, 
i believe?)) what the feature would do is alot
like how IM programs work. If one of the other
players is typing something, it will alert you
next to their name in your RP group window.
 
many times, in big rp groups, it can get real confusing
because everyones sending messages at the same time.
this feature would give people the chance to wait for
someone to finish typing something before responding
with their own action.

Subject Preserve / herbs~
Text
I've no idea if the idea for a Peasant class
was ever really accepeted or not, but if it were
, here's an idea I have for it.
 
If you remember, hiddukel, i suggested a long time
ago an ability that would allow the user to preserve
herbs and plants by increasing their lifespan
(before they poof). You said if any class were to get
the ability, it would be an Herbalist class. Well,
peasants often have skills like that. Drying out herbs
or making tinctures or whatever to preserve their 
usefulness. Perhapse that class could get the Preserve skill.
((as far as i know, the only HERB that dissapears like that
is Goldbloom. only lasts about 10-20 tics after being found))
 
** 
 
To go hand in hand with that, I'd propose a revamping
of the Herba Discern skill. Alot of the herbs are pretty useless
after reaching mid to high levels. Maybe there could be more,
powerful herbs implemented that would, like goldbloom, have a
lifespan, so they couldn't be stocked up on. That would make a skill 
like Preserve useful and relevant.
 
** 
 
If not a peasant class, I think it would make sense for
Druids to get the Preserve skill. Druids seem to be a little
more inclined in that area, than Rangers really.

Subject Ranger balancing~
Text
Another thing I've mentioned many times. I've thought
about it more, and have possibly more information 
on which to make my argument with. The ranger is a specialized
fighter type, excelling in wilderness combat. As such,
a Ranger would possess many abilities to help them survive and fight
in such areas as a forest, or swamp, or mountains, or desert or plains.
 
Looking at the Ranger class right now, they really only have
a few area-type specific combat related abilities, being 
Quiet Movement and Camoflage for detection, Ambush for damage,
Grasping Roots for debilitation, Herbs as an accessory, and traps,
for combat assistance. 
 
As I've said before, there's only a few traps for the ranger,
and the only one thats really any use is the Pit trap.
 
Herbs, most herbs are unuseful to the mid to high level
Ranger, because they could much more easily find a potion substitute,
that is probably more powerful (because, problem with herbs,
the spell level on them is set, and is for the most part low.
this is what makes them obscelete by the time the ranger is higher
level themself. The herbs dont get any better)
 
Ambush is decent, and as always, camoflage and quiet movement are
useful.
 
If I compared this list of area-specific abilities to the lists of
specialized combat abilities Barbarians or Knights get, it would be
dwarfed. 
 
Now, i'm not proposing Rangers get the same skills, with different
names. I would like to see some more area-specific abilities for the ranger.
Over the course of the next few weeks, I will try and come up with
unique abilities that will fit the ranger profile well, by taking
advantage of the rangers surroundings, be it frozen tundra, marshy swamp,
or dry plains or desert.

Subject Ranger and Thief: traps and boobytraps~
Text
Here's an interesting idea.
 
Perhapse high level rangers and thieves have gained enough
knowledge to do away with pre-made traps and craft one
of their own, specific for the very room they are in, to maximize
affect. The skill would be something like Craft Trap and Craft Boobytrap.
Here's how it works: The ranger or thief would, if they typed
Craft trap or craft boobytrap with no argument, a list of the traps 
they could set. The traps would be specific to the room type:
A thief would have maybe one or two traps for an outdoor city area, 
or an indoor city area, maybe another specifically for an alley (the most deadly)
 
whilst the ranger would have a list of traps, maybe just one for each wilderness room type.
A special trap for forests, and another for swamps, one for mountains,
maybe one for caves, or hill or desert. Whatever.
 
When the trap was chosen, via the craft skill (lets say one of the thieves
indoor boobytraps was called Smokebomb, they would type
'craft smokebomb' and their character would begin crafting AND
setting the trap in the room. there would be a lag time of maybe 2 or 3 rounds.
If success, the trap is set. 
 
This would be fun, giving the ranger or thief some strategy,
because if they had a particular trap they needed to employ,
they might have to lure or herd their target in to the specific
type of area they need them in to build the trap.
 
it would also expand the number of deployable traps,
which is small right now

I wanted to come back and say, the herb system might be more
useful if the level of spells on the herbs were equal
to the person picking them's level. for example,
the most powerful herb, goldbloom, is only level 25.
that means the invisibility and glitterdust are so low level

Subject Lowbie Area and Inns~
Text
So I've been here for about 48 hours so this may seem a bit presumptuous but I am resigned to the fact that I am an annoying person. Anyway. Idea: A new area more friendly for the lvl 5-15 character.
 
Reasons: Having to mass murder jump-roping girls in Palanthas just seems to be a very poor way to get past the early levels. And quite honestly, hearing the dying screams of little children and seeing blood trails to and fro the temple and down each alley kills some of the RP/IC mood in what appears to be the most frequented and used town in the game.
 
So perhaps the forested area to the west of the city (since this is where newbies are likely to be) can be expanded and populated by nasty goblins and trolls or other wildlife that need slaying. Perhaps innocent and lost pilgrims and travelers can be thrown in to be slaughtered by those of a more evil persausion. Maybe an entire camp!
 
And perhaps an inn or lodge in the aforementioned woods where adventurers can rest for food and health to prevent the bloody wounds of lowbies from gushing all over the bakery and streets of Palanthas. This might also be a good oppurtunity to at least add some more opputunities for more more diverse low level gear.
 
Expanding on this, maybe something similar near Neraka and whatnot to encourage players to use other areas early.
 
SUB IDEA: Speaking of inns (see paragraph 4), I've noticed inns around the world have rooms but not in Palanthas. Perhaps these could be added sometime, allowing players to temporarily buy keys or something. I think this could add to the atmosphere and provide additional locations for RP. (And not just for THAT. Jeeze. Get your minds out of the gutters, people.)
 
Thank you for your attention to a fairly lengthy note. -fin.

Subject Temples and Alignment~
Text
Here's an idea I had last night that would inflict
some DL realism on the mud. All temples and their
grounds (room(s) leading up to the temple) would have
an alignment flag, if its a good god, it would have a Good
aligned flag, if it was an Evil god, Evil aligned flag,
and neutra Neutral aligned flag on the rooms. 
 
If, say, a Good character decides to stroll in to a temple to
Takhisis or Sargonnas, every tic they are standing in that
Evil aligned room, they will suffer the divine wrath of
the god(dess) of that temple. This will look something
like this:
 
You feel the excruciating pain of Divine Wrath.
 
others will see:
 
((Name here)) looks as if they are in excruciating pain.
 
Every tic that you are infliced with Divine Wrath will do 2 things:
damage you for 10% of your total HP AND inflict the following affect: 
Divine Wrath - 0 hours ((lasts only till the next tic))
Divine Wrath will prevent any healing done to the target.
 
So every turn you are in an oppositely aligned holy place, you will suffer
1/10th of your life in damage and will be unable to heal yourself until removing
yourself from the place.
 
I think 1/10th is good, because that would allow a fully healed person 10 tics in
such a temple before dying. this would allow someone very determined to accomplish something
but they would not be able to stay long.
 
Neutra aligned temples will not inflict such punishment on Good or Evil characters.
So essentially, neutral temples will remain just as temples are now.

Subject Ranger Skills~
Text
The Vision: I've always had a fondness in my heart for both rangers and archers in general. Therefore, I plan on throwing out several ideas and hope that maybe one of them might actually be good (some I invented myself and some I partly borrowed from other games and MUDS). Most of these ideas are focused on my vision of rangers as strategists. They rely on cunning and wit to survive against more heavily armored and strong opponents. And also after peaking at the ranger skills, I do see very large gaps in some levels (50-70, 37-45, 80+) that might need some filling.
 
Evade Traps: The more skilled ranger would be able to avoid traps rather than immediately disarming them. This allows him to disarm if he feels the need, possibly giving him a chance to recover the trap for his own use. Or it would allow him to retreat from a nearby battle and lead his victom into preplaced traps of his own.
 
Arrow Penetration: Reduces the chance of an opponent to dodge or deflect a Ranger's arrows by XX percent. (The Ranger's answer to arrow deflection, I suppose)
 
Bind Wounds: Boy scouts can do it, why not the independent and self-reliant ranger with acute knowledge of herbs and their possible healing properties?. Not to mention, if a ranger does not want to be tracked, leaving a trail of blood everywhere gets in the way.
 
Poison Arrows: The Ranger's next shot poisons the victim. Requires a bow to use. OR, we can expand on a Ranger's herbal knowledge where he can pre-poison arrows in his quiver that he can fire during the course of a battle. Poisonous effects could include ones that make the opponent sluggish and less likey to hit the enemy, a tranquilizing shot that reduces damage or nulls berserking effects, mind-numbing poisons that make it harder for casters to focus, etc.
 
Douse: Let's a Ranger quickly hide all signs of a campfire, hiding his presence in the area. (Mostly an RP tool I guess. Again inspired by the boyscouts. "Leave no trace behind!")

Subject Rangers Ideas Part Two~
Text
Instead of one really really long note, I've chosen to harass you all with two slightly shorter notes. Anyway, back to the ideas:
 
Bow Mastery: An enchanced damage for bow, perhaps. Maybe increases hit/crit chance as well. Mostly to get bows to be more worthwhile.
 
Rapid shooting: Increases chanfe for a ranger to occasionally get an extra shot in. Same concept and motivations as the above.
 
Pathfinding: Years of survival in the wilderness allows the ranger to move more easily outdoors, reducing movement loss. Bonus: If he's leading a group, the group members benefit from this as well.
 
Flaming arrow: Striking flint as he draws back his bow, the Ranger ignites his arrow before shooting it at the target, doing extra damage and having a chance to set the target aflame.
 
Aerial Shot: The Ranger attempts to hit a flying target. If it does indeed hit, does a large amount of damage and a chance of grounding the target (levitating mages beware! You may be out of reach of a sword (hypothetically) but not a bow! Also useful to shoot down birds, wyverns, dragons and the like if you feel the need))
 
That's all my ideas folks. Thanks for your attention, criticism and input.

Pathfinding was actually an I dea that just occured to me

of bind wounds, you said it yourself, ranger's have knowledge of
herbs. Just make a new herb with a similar affect. When applied
or eaten, it will stop bleeding and increase regeneration or something.
also, evade traps is another excellent idea. it's
always peeved me when i set traps for someone and then find myself
having to backtrack upon them, and disarming them... would be
great to be able to avoid the trap, while leaving it intact.
((maybe this idea could be added on to the disarm trap skill,

two modes, Evade and Disarm. Evade will do exactly as exlplained
above, and Disarm will work just like it does now.

knock the the person off balance, even possibly leading
to them falling to the ground outright, dazed for a round or two.
 
The offbalance affect would only last for 0-1 hours (1-2 tics), and it

Subject Lunge and lunge-like skills~
Text
I've got to bring this up, it's a glaring
hole in logic to me, as well as game balance.
I'm bringing this up partially because Lunge
is overpowered, compared to the other lunge-like
skills, but specifically because i feel like
ambush is being cheated out.
 
At level 45, with less tha 40 damage roll,
using a javelin of lightning, a knight can
deal 900+ (upwards of 1100 damage) with a
lunge on a bat, which is level.. 90 something,
while Daenithan, my ranger, with superior weapons,
a damage roll of 93 I believe, can barely hit 700
with an abmush on an antelope, which is lvl 30 maybe.
 
Now, look at the logic here. Lunge can be used anywhere,
has a very moderate restriction based on the current hp
of the victim, and can be used with most weapon types,
i think.
 
ambush requires a succesful camoflauge check in order
to be used (or rather, you must already be succesfuly
camoflauged) and camoflauge in itself requires the user
to be in a wooded area. So Ambush, you must use a skill
prior to ambushing, and must be in a forest-type 
environment, and the damage is pitiful. Mages can cast
a torment spell for the same damage an ambush can do,
and thats once a round. Lets look at others, like
joust and cleave. Cleave is restricted by Axe-only,
the damage is the same as an ambush. Joust requires
a polearm-like weapon AND be mounted, and it's damage
is pitiful.
 
Seriously, what's up with lunge?

Now, I know that global channels are severely frowned
upon (i agree absolutely), but I've got an idea that will
help us immortals when we're trying to render aid to the
new, as well as help the new know where to go for questions.
 
The newbie channel would only be seen/used by Immortals,
Heros, and characters level 20 and under. 
 
Just today, I saw several new characters on, and I wanted to
ask them all if they're getting along alrigh, if there was
any help they needed, and I realized how much easier it would
be if there was a way I could communicate with them all at once.

Subject Herbs Level~
Text
For those few individuals who play classes that get
Herbal Discern, you've undoubtedly noticed the relative
unusefulness of most of the herbs. This isn't due to the
type of affects, but rather the potency of them. Most herbs
hold spell's of a level no greater than 20 or 30. This makes
them more hassle than beneficial, and ultimately superflous 
to the mid to high level character. I suggest that herbs scale
in spell-affect level based on the level of the picker. Perhaps
3 instances of each herb can be made, basically creating 3 tiers
of herbs. First tier will be level 25, second tier level 60,
third tier level 100. A player who picks the herbs will receive the
herb that falls within their tier, that way, over time, herbs
will get better, and retain their usefulness to the picker, as they
climb the ladder of levels.

Of course, if a little more time was spent revamping the
current system of herbs, the herbs could just scale more
minutely, rather than in less-frequent and larger gaps.
Player picks herb, after a succesful skill check, skill
checks characters level, and loads an herb with their level,
with spell affects on the herb matching the herb's level.

Subject New Commands?~
Text
Well I know Im new here, and I know this isnt an RP enforced mud, but there are a few simple snippets of code that are available for ease of implementation for the rom codebase that would make RP a bit better.
 
First being a sayto command. We need one. Bad. :P
 
Second, Osay. I mean, sure we can type, say OOC yada, but osay would be much more simpler.
 
Third thing is turning that hunger/thirst code off. Or perhaps we can have an RP mode which lets players know who is actively roleplaying - and at the same token turns that silly little code off.
Anyway, just a thought. Hope you all take it into consideration.

Text
I noticed a lot of people want hunger/thirst gone or at least a toggle... I don't really care too much but I had a few ideas on how you could implement it. 
One way... the same as passive experience. When you don't fight anythign for a while, it turns off...
 
Another way, have it to where it's like a spell. It'll last for so long and the effect will wear off and there will be a timer to when you can use it again.

Well, I was wandering around with Aleina and we were discussing mounts and
I had an idea. For those of us that are attatched to our mounts, horses, in
particular, it would be cool if we could equip them with saddles and other
pieces of medievil equipment.
Coding behind it is fairly easy, could just set a check for items to give,
and then order the horse to wear the appropriate piece of equipment. The
eq itself could give defensive boosts or what have you, and make things
generally more cool. :P
It would give players an incentive to take care of their mounts. Perhaps
we could even fit the horses with saddle bags to hold items?

Here is a very interesting idea someone mentioned to me earlier.
I think it's worth some consideration.
 
The idea involves the immortal role of Hiddukel. Some players
, namely those who are devoted to Hiddukel or are a part of the
Thieves clan, feel like they dont get the immortal attention they
deserve, since the mud's owner and head of everything :) uses the
name for their game account. 
 
It was suggested that Hiddukel use an OOC name for their character,
that way the role of Hiddukel is open to an RP immortal to take,
thus giving the Thieves the true attention they deserve.

Subject Taking the Cheap Road Out of Dodge~
Text
I realize that I am relatively new to the Solamnic Clan. But I think about this matter often. Would it be possible to tweak the charge system? It seems sort of easy for the criminal (person charged) to avoid their jail time. I've witnessed many of them travel to a powerful mob, and let it kill them, so they do not have to go to jail. 
I believe this is cheap. And pathetic. Level 100's have it even easier. They have no experience points to worry about, if they do this. It happens all the time. I in know way mean to disrespect your current system. It is great, but this charge thing...doesn't really work, if they can escape jail time so easily. I realize it is the duty of the clan folk to capture them. But it's nearly impossible if the first thing the criminal does is go have themselves killed.
Their bandit pals, are sometimes asked OOC to slay them. That is another way the criminal escapes their charge. I've watched it happen on alts, many times.
I've had many of folk ask my alt OOC to slay them to escape the charges given to them by a Solamnic. I have no idea if this has been brought up before. And I in now way mean to down the current system. I'll repeat, that it is a great system. But certain players seem to take the easy road out, quite often. Thank you for listening guys, this is just a thought. Have fun playing LOK.

Subject Clans~
Text
They're the center of broken rp. I suggest maybe killing off the clans until LoK's population rises and rp is restored to people's contents.
 
Right now, as my character's story and background is; she definately doesn't belong in the Black Order. I joined it because no other clan suited Zeboim and I wanted to join a clan with my friends. Black Order, as I see it, is a broken concept as there's not much room for character growth if you are to be devoted to all of the dark gods.
 
When I take this view on things and look at all of the other clans, they all seem similar. Not many characters fit their clans. Many player versus player conflict arise from clans. On top of all of that, I don't even see many purposes in some of the clans. Yeah, it creates a place for a lot of people, but the only three factions I see as worthy of being clans are Conclave, Solamnics, and KoT.
 
Things like undead, aesthetic, foresters, and artisans seem more along the lines of role playing than clans.
 
Anyways, it's something to think about. I don't expect this idea to take form, but maybe it'll spark something that might induce a change from some brilliant mind.

Subject Battle for Cities~
Text
The idea is only for clan's I believe should be ic but remotely placed. By this, I mean that the action for battling would be in character, but where the battle takes place would be away from the city, but a part of the city. Here's my idea:
 
* Add a room in each main city that links to a different area
* In those area's, there will/should be multiple high leveled mobs
* It should take 5-8 high leveled people (90 or above) to kill all the mobs
* The area should be a no-recall/no-teleport area
* When people die, it should act as if they died by a clan guard
 
Now, here's where the idea comes from: when a clan kills off the mobs, the city is reverted to that clan's city. Now I'm not saying that Foresters should be able to take all the cities in Krynn. Here's what could happen:
 
(When a city is taken over)
* A few guards at each of the cities entrances is replaced by semi-high leveled mobs
* The mobs shouldn't be able to see invis or hidden people
* A sign of occupation should be posted outside of the city as a warning
* Fee's "could" be set up for players who aren't apart of that clan that wants to enter
* Every clan except KoT and Solamnics should only be able to occupy 1-2 cities
 
It's an idea that could be played upon. Where this idea came from was when I was thinking how KoT rp tends to fall down upon marching out to conquer a city. I find it kind of lame to rp taking a city versus rp preping to take a city and rp after taking the city.
 
When the server resets or whatever, have the cities revert to nuetral. Also, have Neraka and Palanthas set as heavily fortified and naturally under respected orders (Kot and Solamnics.)
On top of that, I think that only clan members of one order should be able to enter the battlegrounds when attacking the city. The only clan exemplified from this rule are the people who are in the clan that owns that city.

Not really neccessary, but I find myself wondering if I just missed someone or if they even got on today.

Assassins gain the ability to coat their weapons with a powerful

victim to go into a coma lasting about 5 to 10 ticks, at which point it
wears off.  The poison needs to be reapplied to the weapon each time, and
would be most effective with for example a backstab.  You backstab the
victim, flee if you can, and try to avoid being killed until the poison
catches up.  Adrenalin in combat prevents the victim from succumbing, so if
they keep fighting, they don't go down.

Text
Let me just say this isn't meant to bash the class at all...  It just
needs an overhaul.  I mean the battlemage class here is outdated and makes
it completely useless to play.  Which is why there are so many of us running
around.  Our greatest and most powerful attack spell is iceblast.  At level
47.  The help file makes them sound like conjurers and warrior mix.  Would i
would view as actually being able to fight, and cast some decent spells. 
Likely i would see counter, a lead attack that actually does something other
then tickle.  Maybe some cool staff moves since they can create a
battlestaff (which btw is a little lame).  As far as spells go, i'd like to
see there blade barrier and flying swords be able to do some damage.  Help
files makes them sound as if the spells get more powerful as you go, but i
have yet so see it.  Maybe make a blade barrier act like a barrier, where it
interjects between you and who you fight so it defends you, and acts to
damage the opponent.  Also more warding spells, and maybe a decent attack
spell.  I'm not asking for mindshatter or gate or anything.  But something
orginal, maybe something you have to set up for.  Cast blade barrier and
then if they survive by the time you cast the new spell the blades attack
the opponent and explode shattering and blasting them.  Ripping up their
armor and doing some damage.  Maybe making them defend less and bleed.  Just
asking to make the class playable, i love them for the massive way you can
roleplay them, if you pretend their abilities are much more powerful then
they are codewise.  But i would like to see them have some use so people
aren't afraid to make them.

Subject Tournament arena~
Text
So its recently come to my attention that an arena exists in another place and time and I had a few ideas id just like to share for any whom may concerned about its use.
These are just some brainstormed ideas but how about:
A player could challenge another player anywhere in the world(as long as they are on the who list) with a command like
<challenge> <player> and then the challenged player could receive a simple message like "so and so has challenged you to battle in the arena. Accept or Decline."
and then that player could either accept or decline by typing something like <Challenge> <accept/decline>
if they decline then nothing happens but if they accept then both parties are transferred to the arena entrance where they could
either just enter the arena doors and it randomly place them inside the small arena.place both parties in the same room in arena.or make them
read a rules of arena message board with things like "dont loot." etc.(I saw one already exists.) before entering
With victory the winnder could be instantly sent home to bask in glory and the loser remain in the arena to collect his things before going up or something to exit
like the newb arena. only passing through several rooms of shame before returning home.
Also there could be like a tournament office(much like the bounty hunter one) where anyone could look at winners and losers of past matches.maybe collect prizes?
bet on players? or just look at the winners and losers for bragging rights.I think this will do good to feed the competitive nature of pk while still providing choice
to decline for those not interested.
Just some ideas :P

I think there should be an additional command associated, allowing the caster of mirror to specify how many mirrors are made, up to the max allowed by their level.
For instance they could type 'c mirror 1' and that would make one mirror of themself, or 'c mirror <target> 3' and make 3 mirrors of their target.
It would just be useful because if you're trying to use mirror to fool someone, it always creates as many as possible and no one is fooled, whereas if you were to flee, invis, and make 1 mirror, they might see it and think it's you.

I like rangers as they are. They're extremely versatile and if you know how to use them, very powerful. They do however have a big flaw that I see with literally no other class. They have no skills OR spells that you can use to bring a person out of invisibility or hiding!
I think they deserve at least one skill or spell that would do that, considering I just had a fight that lasted muuuuuuch longer than it should simply because a knight was able to quaff a potion and go invis, and the only way to draw him out of invis was to reveal myself, which resulted in me getting lunged, then he could just proceed to quaff another demon essence and be fine again.

Perhaps an OOC area, branching off of the Newbie Glade of Beginnings? Rooms, each dedicated to a character that is long since gone, retired. Perhaps an item set in stone in the room, with a short brief history of the character. Each inductee have been nominated and voted upon by the playerbase. Each immortal gets one vote. Each player (mortal gets one vote, from one of their characters). One vote each. For everyone. Voting held once a year. 3-4 people get inducted a year. 
That's only 3-4 rooms that have to be built a year. If no one is nominated, no one is inducted. It could provide motivation for people. Newbies. Regulars. Anyone. To get out and be productive. Just an idea. Throwing it out there. Anyone with anymore input, ideas. Feel free to speak on it. 
The area could be open to the public, a path to it from the newbie glade or palanthas. 
Who would you nominate? The first class would have to be incredibly respectable. If ya make a nomination, you send a couple in depth paragraphs of why they are being nominated. Their history. You can't nominate your own characters. Their would be a timeframe each year to make nominations. The nominees from the playerbase and narrowed down by the immortal staff. The immortal staff has a set amount of time to narrow their nominees down.  
When the narrowing down part is done, a poll is posted with the nominees listed for voting purposes, either on the game itself or on the forums.
Perhaps the forums, in an attempt to lead the players to the forums more so...to get the forums more active. 
Voting has a set timeframe. No more, no less. A certain percentage of the votes, have to be cast in your favor, to get inducted. And the characters nominated only get 2 attempts on the ballot, to get inducted. If the character doesnt receive the percentage needed for induction, in his two times of being on the ballot, then the characters attempt to ascend to LOK immortality is over. The character is no longer eligble for the Hall of Fame.
Simply an idea. Being thrown out there. An idea is all. Any input?

I had a pretty good idea on how to balance scrolls.
There is already a short timer for when you recite scrolls, but my idea was that the more spells are on a scroll, the longer that timer is.
It would kinda make sense since it would be a longer incantation to recite, and it would balance it because if you walk in and drop a triple convoke scroll, you have a decent little timer before you can flee, so if that doesn't kill them, you may be in trouble.

Blacksmiths at level 35 get a skill called "smith" I think it should be

on the fact that you cant actually use the "smith" command.  An example

Subject New Clan~
Text
Alright, so I thought this would be a great idea, and I think everyone else would agree.
Alright, well this has to deal with clans as said in the subject.  Now not everyone creates a character and wants to join a certain clan or what not. Like say a kender who is a thief, why should he have to join the Thieves guild, to be in a clan? I know he does not have to, its just an example.  What if the mage or knight does not want to lay his heart to a specific cause, but still wants a clan?
 
I know, we can just not join a clan, but lets face it, a clan opens up more RP.
So, I thought of a clan that may be acceptable to those who wish to be in a guild, but not claim love for a certain cause.  This would be the Adventures Guild.  This guild is soely for those who wish to be part of a group, but not one of the main Clans, Ie: Conclave, KoT, KoS, HO, BO, etc.  This clan is fit to those who wish to join up with their fellow adventuers and set on journeys, quests, to search for lost treasures, to scoure the world of Krynn for dangers, glory, stories to tell!
Now, there will have to some requirments. I don't think Draconian's or Ogres should be allowed in said clan. I mean icly they are not the "I wanna join up for a treasure hunt, mr.elf!" No, they'd want to kill everyone. So they would be out of the question.  Any class can join, be you a thief, an assassin, a warrior, mage to knight. Be you a bard, a thief of spells, a barbaric man to a druid of the land.  Now on races, Ogres I think shoudlnt be, but if there is a good ic reason, a good story by all means.
Now, I think Kenders should be VERY welcomed to the clan, they are the embodiment of Adventure, and of stories.  Humans, elves, gnomes even your friendly neighborhood gully dwarf. Maybe, even a minotaur... again that is an iffy race, but I could see it happen.
 
Alright, now some other things.
Clanhall: The Wandering Drunk Inn.
This would be a mansion type Inn.  If anyone had ever played Final Fantasy 12, you'd get the idea of what Im thinking about. This would be an inn that would be able ot house MANY adventurers at any given time, a bar where friends could get together and relive old memories, or talk about their quests and hunts.
There would be an an armory room, where adventurers of all kinds can leave weapons and armor for fellows of their guild.  Almost like a treasure room.  There would be say a room like a dueling yard.  Where those who are waiting on a new adventure they could spar with others.
(mind these are just ideas for the rooms and all) And a main room or whatever, where adventures converse, and swap stories and others seeking help for a quest. That type of thing.
 
Clan backup: Im thinking a clan backup if it was allowed, would be a Direwolf, or a Pathfinder.
ClanTell: The clan tell would be I'd say a Raven. IE: A raven lands, a missive attached to its leg, it says "...........>
Also if you were to give clan skills, Im not sure, thats up to you.
Now, I know more GODS(imms) are assigned to a clan already, and thats already a handfull.  So i think, if you were to allow this clan, that maybe you could choose a respectful and respected mortal, someone trustworthy and all, and make em an imm, not to where anyone could devote to them or anything, that way people can devote to whoever they want in this clan. But they would be the reigning IMMORTAL to the guild. Then you got your guild leaders, etc.
I think that is all, really. You can contact me whenever.
Hidd, if you need to talk to me also, you can email me ad Djandreau1988@gmail.com

Subject Modification to rogue-classes~
Text
Remove "detect hidden" spell from them and replace with a skill called "keen senses" that does the exact same thing but without spell decay. Thieves and their kind don't
see hidden through magic, they see it through an innate familiarity of things hidden from plain sight.

Subject Deadeye Bug~
Text
Hey all.  I had a new player notify me that deadeye isn't working
according to the description in the helpfile.  In the helpfile, it states
that deadeye should grant vision in the dark.  He didn't have a light (I'm
not sure why), but he discovered that deadeye does not grant darkvision.  I
think most of us didn't realize it because we have endless lights.  I got
him set up with coldlight, so he's all right, just giving a heads up.  :)

Subject Room 9014 - Pet Shop Reset Room~

Somehow, a player was able to shadowwalk into room 9014 by targeting a
squirrel.  Gate does not work, and earthmeld does not work, only shadowwalk.
Just giving a heads up.  Thanks!

Subject Dwarvencraft~
Text
I found this on some D&D site while browsing for some new weapon/armor ideas amd thought it was pretty neat. Its a specail class and race skill just for dwarven smiths. Its called Dwarvencraft. Heres what the site said about it. 
-While masterwork weapons are available from any skilled craftsman, the dwarves have perfected their skills to an almost magical degree. They possess secrets of smithing and weapon engineering that outstrip cultures that are less challenged by both their natural environment and competition for its limited resources.
-While many dwarf weaponsmiths and armorers are capable of crafting masterwork items, as normal, dwarf smiths have created another category of quality that goes beyond masterwork. appropriately, such items are generally referred to as dwarvencraft items.
-Dwarvencraft items are always of masterwork quality. Only items crafted primarily of metal or stone are available in dwarvencraft quality. An item must be declared a dwarvencraft item at the time of its creation; items cannot be upgraded to dwarvencraft quality once finished. Prices for dwarvencraft items include the cost for masterwork quality.
-A dwarvencraft item is stronger and harder than a comparable masterwork item.
 
 Now, this is basically how the skill should work given the description above. It only works on weapons/armor made out of metal (iron, steel, brass, gold, silver, etc.) and stone. Instead of having to type in "Forge *material* into *level* *item*" and then typing "masterwork *item*" this skill would do it all in one go and make it stronger than a regular masterwork so the prompt would look something like this "dwarvencraft *material* into *level* *item*"
I think that to make it happen, two smiths should still be present, but obviously, the other smith is going to have to be a dwarf...or it could have a huge timer on it so there wouldnt be any spamming of the skill.

Subject Note spool~
Text
Yerthorn and I spoke toguether and thought that it would be better to organize the note spool presenting the new notes first, rather than the older notes.
Mainly because most of us have the note spool overflowing and we can't check the new notes on the note list.

Subject Command to list who is devoted to you.~
Text
I was thinking some thing like the clist where it list all those who is
in a clan.  Only for immortal's to be able keep track who is devoted to them
and maybe what level and last time on.  Just a idea to toss out and think
about.

Subject Item Storage Idea~
Text
Hello! Barius Bracchus, B.B, here! Wanted to suggest an idea.
I'd like for the guildhalls to have a vault for guild members to store their items in, so players would be able to free up some inventory space. Perhaps make the vault/chest/container unique to each player by issuing a key that opens up only that player's stored inventory in the guild vault. This would be a good way to manage inventory, keep important clan-related items safe, and give players more incentive to join guilds. It would be cool to store items that won't dissapear with a server reset.

So I have been working on a Knight character, and I have been spamming
his skills with fighting.  As I was going through the skills and testing
them I noticed that while dual wielding a whip with an axe as your primary
you cant trammel with whip in your secondary hand.  Is there a way to change
that?
