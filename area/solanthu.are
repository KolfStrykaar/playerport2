A mangy mutt is growling at you.

In front of you is a medium sized dog.  The fur on the dog is quite

mean, and most definitely something that should be messed with.

The White Stag Tavern~
This modest tavern is a newer addition to the city, having been
commissioned by the Town Council during the reconstruction.  A large common
area boasts a long table along the western wall, some semi-private booths at
the eastern end, and a series of smaller round tables throughout.  To the
north lies the main bar and kitchen area; kept busy at all hours by the
constant influx of travelers and citizens alike.  More often than not, a few
members of the town guard may be seen taking up residence during their off
hours.

South Entrance of Solanthus~
This is the Southern entrance into the city.  It is one of the least
traveled entrances into the city by whoever decides to come into the city.
The ground here feels like normal ground, because it is not traveled all
that much.  In the distance to the north is a bridge.  To the south, lie the
Garnet Mountains.

path seems quite new and in good condition.  The ground here feels like
normal ground, because it is not traveled all that much.  To the west lies a
Guard Barracks, the east a Watch Tower, and to the north, is the Northern

Watch Tower~
This is one of the watchtowers that guard the city of Solanthus.  From
up here in the tower, one can get a good look at what is going in and out of
the city.  In the tower is a barrel of arrows, presumably for times that the
arrows may be needed.  The watchtower itself is quite beat up from several
attacks on it from the post war.  The tower exits to the west.

their feet.  The inside of the barracks are quite dark and gloomy, and
therefore, one cannot make out much detail of the inside.  The Barracks
continue south, while the Southern entrance is to the east.

Office of the Registrar~
This small building is home to most of the city's day to day operations. 
Dealing with everything from road maintenance to vendor licenses, the front
office has been reserved for the City Registrar.  Responsible for keeping
track of the populace and taking a yearly census, several scribes can be
seen sorting, copying and filing all manner of official documentation. 
Piled atop the front desk sits a large stack of citizenship applications.  

*A large SIGN has been tacked to the wall next to the stack.*

This temple has been erected in the name of the goddess of industrial

the temple, but the answer is obvious that nobody steals from the temple and
comes out alive.  The exit of the temple is north.

Watch Tower~
This is one of the watchtowers that guard the city of Solanthus.  From
up here in the tower, one can get a good look at what is going in and out of
the city.  In the tower is a barrel of arrows, presumably for times that the
arrows may be needed.  The watchtower itself is quite beat up from several
attacks on it from the post war.  The tower exits to the west.

Temple of Paladine~
This temple has been erected in the name of the father of good and master
of law, Paladine.  As such, the temple is quite ornate with various designs,
and murals on the walls of the inside.  All inside the temple are various
signs of Paladine, including symbols, tapestries, robes, jewelry, and the
like.  In the center of this temple room, lies a very large, intricate
statue of a platinum Dragon.

dragon~
This large statue is of a Dragon, but appears to be slightly different in
design, than what typical Dragons look like.  The statue is made out of pure
platinum, to represent the Father of Good, Paladine, as he would appear in
his Dragon form.  The statue has a slight glow to it, and one could almost
swear that the statue was peering down at them, smiling ever so elegantly.
The base of the statue is made from stone, and has some sort of writing
etched into it.  Upon close examination, it reads...
{x
{x             'My devoted children. Repent your sins, and I shall
{x             grant you divine favor. Speak thy words aloud, and I 
{x                              shall hear you'
{x
{x             Father of Dragons, I repent and ask for forgiveness!

As you start to climb down the steep spire, your weight causes your foot and
handholds to collapse beneath you, sending you plummeting all the way down to
the bottom. At the bottom of the spire a little door opens underneath you,
revealing a bed of very sharp spikes as nothing impedes your descent down,
impaling you on the spikes. You are DEAD!!!

Temple of Mishakal~
This temple has been erected in the name of the goddess of healing,
Mishakal.  As such, the temple is very beautiful with various murals on the
walls of the inside.  All inside the temple are various signs of the great
goddess, including symbols, tapestries, robes, jewelry, and the like.  The
exit of the temple is east. Directly in the middle of the temple, lies a metal
stand, holding a large white bowl of water. Around the base of the bowl, words
have been etched into it.
 
(** Note: Go down, if you wish to go to Newbie School. You will not be able

E
bowl~
Before you is a large bowl, crafted from white stone, which is filled to
the brim with cool, blue water.  The water appears to be giving off a sort
of turqoise glow.  Around the base of the bowl, words have been elegantly
etched into it.  They appear to be written in the common tongue.  The words
read -
{x
'For those seeking my blessing, call me out for my divine favor and I shall grant
{x you my warm blessing. The words you must speak aloud are:'
{x
Blessed Lady of the Heart, have mercy upon my soul and cast my body into the heavens!

Guild Lane~
Guild Lane is named for all the various training facilities and buildings
that it holds.  All along this path, there are constructs of various sizes,
shapes, and forms that serve as facilities of training.  The road here is
quite beaten and worn, by the many classes of beings that travel it to
obtain training.  Guild Lane continues to the west, while to the south is a
small building.

A Small Shack~
This place is very small, only about big enough to hold the basics and
about 3 people.  Plastered about the shack are large WANTED signs of anybody
who has a bounty on their head.  The room itself is sort of dark, with the
only illumination coming from the main door, and a small crack in the corner
of the ceiling.

A Small Building~
This building is a somewhat small building, there is only enough room to
hold a very few people in the building at once.  Along the wall, pictures of
criminals and lost objects are hanging.  Perhaps you will have to hunt one
of these criminals or, find one of the lost treasures.

East Gate of Solanthus~
There is a looming gate standing here, built soon after the War of the
Lance had ended.  The large gate stands about 15 stones tall, and is made
from a combination of fine wood, steel, and other metals.  The gate's posts
are carved with ornate insignias of the gods of Krynn.  Here at the gate,
are other travelers, merchants, and citizens forming a line for entry into
the city.  From here, one can wait, and attempt entry, or go back east, to
the Outskirts of Solanthus.

Watch Tower~
This is one of the watchtowers that guard the city of Solanthus.  From
up here in the tower, one can get a good look at what is going in and out of
the city.  In the tower is a barrel of arrows, presumably for times that the
arrows may be needed.  The watchtower itself is quite beat up from several
attacks on it from the post war.  The tower exits to the south.

Solanthus Trade Exchange~
This large open area has been set aside to accomodate the number of
travelling artisans from all over Ansalon who visit the city to sell their
wares and services.  A number of merchant stalls have been erected around
the perimiter, with a large public forge near the western end.  Here,
various smiths, jewellers, leatherworkers and other craftsmen compare their
handiwork and compete for patrons before moving on to the next town.
