[14329] Syre: 5th sentence- The east the road... should be to the east the road
[14328] Syre: consider revising the last sentence, that last bit sounds off- my recomendation- "Trees surrounded by thick brush and thorns block any entry into the woodland, their vine-ensnared branches barring any travel to the north."

Finally, there is a grammatical error in the last sentence. It should read like this, "It would be best if you left the hut, for who knows what might happen if you are caught here." No offense to who wrote the room description, but

[17422] Anav: *No offense to who wrote the room description, but I don't think a room desc should tell me what I "figure" or that the bears eyes look straight at me, or that I have heard any rumors.. because these are all assumptions that could not ICly apply to every character depending on where they stand in the room... what class they are... if they are social or not... etc. etc. Thanks for your time.
[ 4217] Anav: In the room {BBlue Water{x, along the way to the new area, there is a typo in the second sentence. It should be, "An 'unusual' place this far out, for a tree to be, though upon further inspection it seems to have been at sea for quite awhile.
[ 4209] Anav: In another one of the rooms along the {BBlue Water{x path, there is a typo. In the first sentence it says "A few lone waves wash in from a distant place making the water a bit more rough and hard to manuever." When on water, they aren't waves, the correct term is wake. Secondly, it wouldn't hurt to place a comma in there. "A few lone 'wakes' wash in from a distance place, making the water a bit more rough and hard to manuever."
[ 4208] Anav: In yet another description along the "{BBlue Water{x" pathway to the new area, there is a typo. In the third sentence, "tigs" should be "twigs".
[ 4202] Anav: Along the pathway to the new area "{BBlue Water{x", there is a typo in the second sentence of one of the descriptions. This one, is the right word, just the wrong spelling of the word. In the second sentence it says "The shear vastness...". The word "Shear" is a noun that refers to clippers, the word I beleive you are looking for is "Sheer". *Had to pull out a dictionary for this one ;D*

[ 3005] Shanon: In the helpfile for DEATHGRIP, in the third line, the word "automatically" is spelled with only one "L".  It needs a second
[ 3005] Shanon: Sorry to add another, but, the wording of the same sentence with "automatically" in it is kinda screwy.  Maybe it'd be better as "Once the weapon is removed, the power will automatically diminish back to it its original state."  In the end of that sentence, you have "it's" instead of "its", also, lol.

Look kender: "Before you on the street walks a curious kender, bobbing between people and carts as HE runs down the road.  HE HUMPS into you with a smile, then scurries away." Firstly, there isn't a gender agreement with "her heels" and "he". Secondly, I think (or really hope) that it is supposed to be "bump" and not "hump".
[ 1834] Ralesha: Location: in the cliffs south of Solanthus where all the kobolds are. Typo "A kobold squats here, plaing a game of rock with his friends.' Should be playing.
