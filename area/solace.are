Gaeid has spent his life trying to rise above his station.  In the

royalty.  Though he didn't have a knack for spellcasting, he decided to
devote his life to the pursuit of knowledge.  Toward that end, he moved to
Solace, and set up this shop.  When writers, poets, and spellcasters come in
to buy supplies, he enjoys talking to them about a wide range of subjects.

it's all part of the greater cycle.  If you sit very quietly with her, she

out hunting for food.  His green tunic and green trousers allow him to
better blend in with the forest surroundings.  Wrapped around his shoulder
is a quiver full of arrows.  He holds a large bow, arrow notched and ready

appears to be extremely busy.  He obtains reports both verbal and written,
looks down for a brief moment as if contemplating what he has just heard or
read, then looks back up at the Guard who gave him the report and shouts out
orders.  He's very aggressive and firm with his speach, although most would
say that it's for the better, gives the citizens of Solace a sense of
security, knowing that someone like this Captain, is watching over their
city.  The armor he wears, has been polished to a brilliant shine.  He
exhibits a well trimmed gotee, which he occasionally strokes when he's given
reports that appear to be bad news.

dwarves ever appear to be in a happy mood?  He wears only a few pieces of
dented armor, perhaps only because he ran out of room to put them up for

around the room, hoping your eyes will follow in order to see what he has on

She teaches that Bards do not have to be thin and beautiful to make a
living, but if they're not, they have to have great talent to back them up. 
As she teaches the methods that she's learned to her students, her brown
eyes sparkle and her laughter is as beautiful and winning as her voice.

A wealthy citizen of Solace stands here, counting the coins in his purse.
~
Tall and proud, the gentleman standing here is transfixed on his open
purse, perusing through his collection of gold and silver coins, counting
each one piece by piece, even holding every other piece up in the air to
watch them glimmer off the surrounding light.  His attention would appear to
be completely involved in his task, however, every now and then, his eyes
look up and dart quickly from side to side, looking for would-be thieves who
would be more than happy to lighten his "burden" for him.  Judging by the
looks of him, it would appear that one could lighten him of his entire purse
altogether, and he still wouldn't be hurting for money.  His clothes alone,
made from the finest silks and cotton in all of Krynn, are worth more than
at least ten times the steel and gold he carries.  His smooth, clean and
unscathed skin, and his well kempt hair could tell the story of his wealthy
upbringing all on its own.

to teach here while he relearns how to fight, minus the eye.  The training
here is probably the best anywhere, since everyone is training on Grath's
level.  He's not one to lecture to the students, he gets right in there and
throws them around.  Everyone learns in this guildhouse, and after every
lesson, he sends someone for ale.  Grath is no snob, he'll drink with anyone
who brings him alcohol.

regular basis.  She is one of the standouts in the confectionary business,
as a matter of fact.  Her treats are enjoyed all throughout Solace, and it's
not rare that a traveler happens upon her shop and then decides to move to
the city rather than be away from her desserts.

otik sandath~
Otik Sandath~
Otik Sandath stands behind the bar, fixing up drink and food for customers.
~
A rotund and jolly man, with little hair left up on top and a dirty white
apron wrapped around his neck, Otik Sandath is a kind and friendly man with
a big heart.  His large belly comes from the many quarts of ale he drank and
the mass amounts of spiced potatoes and stew he eats.  He doesn't look like
much, but he definitely could hold his own in a bar fight.  His long side
burns and jolly red nose could befriend even a draconian warrior.  He is an
older man with a gift for cooking.

Ghesh'tha~
A spine chilling man, master of the guild, hovers before you.
~
In the total darkness, it is very hard to make out any features this dark
and evil man possesses.  All that is noticeable, is the black, velvet robe he
wears, with the hood pulled slightly back to reveal white hair and shiny,
silver eyes.  He appears to be floating, not standing.  A skeletal hand
reaches out to grab hold of you, perhaps you better think fast.

Thyles~
A black haired Qualinesti elf, master of the guild, stands here.
~
Thyles has always attracted attention for his unusual hair.  Some of his
childhood peers taunted him, saying that he was tainted with human blood,
but his family always denied that.  Some of his teachers thought that he was
the chosen of the gods, but the gods never confirmed that.  And so, he took
up the profession of the outsider: long hours of study to lead to a magical
career.  Still not completely accepted in Qualinost, he decided to come to
Solace to share his knowledge with others and further his own study.

A tall Silvanesti elf, master of the guild, stands here before you.
~
A tall Silvanesti elf stands here, his hair a glimmering silver, with a
few streaks of white.  His eyes almost look to be the color of a daisy, and
his white robes and charming smile, give him away as being a person who's
kind and generous.  It is rumored that his looks should not be taken for
granted, as his magic is very powerful, even feared at times by the Master
of the Conclave.  He only wishes to train those who are willing, the art of
Illusions.

Sean~
A middle-aged man, master of this guild, stands here before you.
~
Sean is small, with a slight build and wisps of blond hair.  He
constantly runs his hand over his balding head as if checking that he does
have some hair left, or maybe to prove to himself that his hair is indeed
jumping off of his head.  Perhaps he picked up this tick when he was a small
boy in Lemish, avoiding the bigger boys.  Either way, he has studied hard
and is now the premier conjuror in the land, and master of this guild.

Felisha~
A bald, but beautiful woman stands before you, the master of this guild.
~
Felisha long ago shaved her head, to rid herself to the distraction of
men vying for her affections, and also because it kept burning off in
battle.  The loss of her hair did nothing to distract from the beauty of her
face, rather, it highlights the pleasing shape of her face and tilt of her
hazel eyes.  She is free of scars only because superb healers have always
been on hand soon after she sustains even the most minor injuries.

it's so she can better carry out the few jobs that she still takes.  If no
one knows what she looks like, she reasons, then no one will suspect her. 
Even the voice that she uses in the guild is different from those when she
ventures outside.  She is a master of death, and the master of this guild.

Kilthandra~
A female half-elf, master of the guild, stands proud before you.
~
Kilthandra comes from the forests far up in Northern Ergoth.  He roots
cannot be traced, other than the fact that she is definitely half human,
and half elf.  Although which race of elves she comes from is unknown too. 
Only the half-pointy ears, smooth skin complexion, and very young looks
gives her away to be half of anything elf.  Her large chest, and long, curly
blonde hair give her human side away.  She doesn't appear to be wearing much
for clothing, only a leather thong and fur boots.  The rest of her body is
covered in paint, her chest only covered up by the long hair she has.  She
carries a bow in one hand, her other hand resting on her hip.  A large
quiver of arrows hangs loosely over her right shoulder.

A male human bounty hunter, stands here waiting to do business.

This man is missing one eye, an arm, and all of his teeth.  As you enter
and take notice, his grin turns into a beaming smile, displaying a filthy
row of unclean gums.  His tunic and trousers are dirtied and shredded.  His
white tainted hair sticks out like a sore thumb, fraying in every direction.
In his good arm, he holds a thick book, possibly the one which contains the
names of all the criminals who have a bounty placed on their head.

The stench of this hobgoblin is enough to make even an Ogre's upper lip
curl.  Her tattered clothes are filthy beyond words.  Her face is ashen
black, dirt and grime growing spores on her cheeks.  Her white hair is
littered with lice, as the infestation is so bad, it is visible to the naked
eye.  She holds a ladle in one hand and a large stirring spoon in the
other, constantly stirring the foul smelling liquid.  She then uses the
ladle to scoop out a little of the liquid and pours it into a vial, which
appears to be magically floating next to her.

3 bardic doughnuts~
1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk
2 eggs beaten fine as silk.

Salt and nutmeg or lemon will do;
Baking powder, teaspoons two.
Now lightly stir the flour in.
Roll on pie board, but not too thin.

Cut in diamonds, twists or rings.
Drop with care the doughy things,
Into hot fat that swiftly swells
Evenly the spongy cells.

Watch with care the time for turning,
Fry them brown, just short from burning.
Roll in sugar, serve when cool;
This is a never-failing rule.

13 Solamnic feast dishes~
Marinade: 
1/2 cup red wine(Burgundy is excellent.
Do not use cooking wine; it's salted.)
2 large pinches dried sage
3 juniper berries, crushed
2 garlic cloves, crushed (or 2 shakes garlic powder)
1/4 cup pineapple juice
1 shake powdered ginger
2 pinches rosemary
2 pinches thyme
3 pinches dried parsley flakes
2 pinches celery leaves
salt
pepper

For the skewer : 
2 to 3 pounds venison tenderloin (or pork) 
2 sweet onions 
1 green pepper 
1 16-ounce can chunk pineapple 
24 cherry tomatoes 
24 fresh mushrooms

A day before serving, mix red wine and pineapple juice in a
large, non-metallic pan. Stir in rest of marinade ingredients
for at least 1 minute. Let mixture rest for an hour so flavors
can meld. Slice tenderloin into 1-inch by 2-inch chunks. Rub
meat with salt and freshly ground pepper. Stir marinade after
its hour is up and add meat. Stir meat to coat all pieces. Cover
and refrigerate overnight, stirring occasionally so all side are
coated and soaked equally.

Prior to grilling, wash all vegetables. Peel onions and cut
them into 1-inch by 2-inch chunks. De-stem tomatoes. Core pepper
and cut it into 1 inch squares. Drain pineapple. Toss meat,
vegetables, and fruit a final time.

Alternate meat, vegetables, and fruit on skewer. Onions and
pineapples are the best neighbors for the meat. Onions should
be skewed from inner to outer layers through all layers,
mushrooms through the stem's center axis.

Grill over medium charcoal for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often.
Remove food from skewer with fork and serve immediately. 
Serves 6.

1 cup powdered sugar 
1/4 teaspoon vanilla 
2 tablespoons cocoa powder 
1/3 cup crushed nuts (baker's choice as to which)

This is a traditional Qualinesti treat, both because elves
love their doglike pets and also because Qualinesti enjoy
any foods containing nuts, which are plentiful in their
forests. Although the baker can choose which particular
nuts she wishes to use, the Qualinesti recipe usually calls
for walnuts.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cream: 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup sugar. Beat in 4 eggs.
Fold in 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
Pour batter into madeleine pan (thus the tongue shape).
Bake about 15 minutes or until light brown. Serve frosted,
or put a filling between two of the cakes of 3 parts chocolate
icing and 1 part crushed nuts. (Sometimes the Qualinesti use
crushed nut brittle instead of simple crushed nuts for the filling!)

The Road to Solace~
Large vallenwood trees loom before you as you find yourself near the
fabled city of Solace.  The leaves of the vallenwoods are turning red and
yellow.  A small gust of wind blows by your face, cool and soothing.  The
road continues south into the Abanasinian forest and north, into the depths
of Solace.

Vallenwood trees bloom all around you, as you find yourself outside the
city limits of the fabled city, Solace.  To the north, the road continues on
leading into the depths of the city.  Houses and shops of a large variety
are barely noticeable, built in huge boughs of mature vallenwood trees.  To
the south, the road leads away from the city and into the depths of the
Abanasinian forest.

Southern Entrance into the Vallenwoods of Solace~
Vallenwood trees loom before you, stretching high into the sky, as if
reaching for the heavens.  Large boughs spawn off these massive trees,
higher than any known creature on Krynn could reach without the aid of
flying or magic.  The large boughs seem to be holding the great city of
Solace up in the trees, up high away from danger, or so its citizens think.

Eastern Vallenwoods of Solace~
Small, pink stones line both sides of the dirt path, clearly marking the
way.  Stately trees rise up on both sides of the well-formed path, their
boughs heavily laden with pretty pink blossoms.  The blossoms are strewn all
over the path, blown from their home by the gentle breeze.  What is most
enchanting about this place, however, is the butterflies which flutter
throughout the trees, attracted by the sweet smelling blossoms.  Thousands
of them dance in the light, their shimmering wings casting a myriad of
rainbow hues throughout.

The Town Registry~
This small office has been set aside for maintaining all sorts of city
records.  Traffic in and out of the building remains brisk, as various
officials tend to matters of bridge maintenance, vendor licenses and trade
agreements from nearby settlements in addition to keeping track of seasonal
dwellers and filing all manner of official documentation.  Piled atop the
front desk sits a large stack of citizenship applications.  
 
*A large SIGN has been posted on the wall next to the front desk*

A Small Short Cut~
Tall Vallenwood trees completely surround you.  A small path here cuts
through them, creating a type of short cut between two major roads in the
forest of Solace.  The air smells of blossoms and roses.  Small insects can
be seen scurrying back and forth, taking cover under fallen leaves.  High up
in the trees, amidst the thick boughs, small houses and shops can be seen,
although there doesn't appear to be any way up there from here.

Eastern Entrance into the Vallenwoods of Solace~
Vallenwood trees loom before you, stretching high into the sky, as if
reaching for the heavens.  Large boughs spawn off these massive trees,
higher than any known creature on Krynn could reach without the aid of
flying or magic.  The large boughs seem to be holding the great city of
Solace up in the trees, up high away from danger, or so its citizens think.

The Outskirts of Solace~
Vallenwood trees bloom all around you, as you find yourself outside the
city limits of the fabled city, Solace.  To the west, the road continues on
leading into the depths of the city.  Houses and shops of a large variety
are barely noticeable, built in huge boughs of mature vallenwood trees.  To
the east, the road leads away from the city and into the depths of the
Abanasinian forest.

hollow high overhead.  The cleared path continues to the north and south.

thicker to the south, while to the north, the trees appear to be thin,

A small trail leading north and south stretches through the great
Vallenwood trees of Solace.  Children run to and fro, hiding behind trees
and chasing after each other.  High up above in the boughs, small houses
have been constructed, keeping families safe from ground attacks.  The air
carries a pleasant smell of blossoms and cherry choke trees.  Wild flowers
grow about on the sides of the trail.  Many people seem to be wandering
around even here on the ground, conducting business as usual.

Western Entrance into the Vallenwoods of Solace~
Vallenwood trees loom before you, stretching high into the sky, as if
reaching for the heavens.  Large boughs spawn off these massive trees,
higher than any known creature on Krynn could reach without the aid of
flying or magic.  The large boughs seem to be holding the great city of
Solace up in the trees, up high away from danger, or so its citizens think.

The Outskirts of Solace~
The Vallenwood trees loom tall before the western entrance into Solace. 
Children laughing, merchants bartering and many other sounds which can be
heard from most cities lies east.  Small children run around hiding behind
the massive trees, perhaps playing a game of hide and seek.

The Western Road to Solace~
Vallenwood trees bloom all around you, as you find yourself outside the
city limits of the fabled city, Solace.  To the east, the road continues on
leading into the depths of the city.  Houses and shops of a large variety
are barely noticeable, built in huge boughs of mature vallenwood trees.  To
the west, the road leads away from the city and to the depths of the
Sentinel Mountains.

The Western Road to Solace~
Large vallenwood trees loom before you as you find yourself near the
fabled city of Solace.  The leaves of the vallenwoods are turning red and
yellow.  A small gust of wind blows by your face, cool and soothing.  The
road continues west into the Sentinel Mountains and east, into the depths of
Solace.

Western Vallenwoods of Solace~
Small, pink stones line both sides of the dirt path, clearly marking the
way.  Stately trees rise up on both sides of the well-formed path, their
boughs heavily laden with pretty pink blossoms.  The blossoms are strewn all
over the path, blown from their home by the gentle breeze.  What is most
enchanting about this place, however, is the butterflies which flutter
throughout the trees, attracted by the sweet smelling blossoms.  Thousands
of them dance in the light, their shimmering wings casting a myriad of
rainbow hues throughout.

A Small Short Cut~
Tall Vallenwood trees completely surround you.  A small path here cuts
through them, creating a type of short cut between two major roads in the
forest of Solace.  The air smells of blossoms and roses.  Small insects can
be seen scurrying back and forth, taking cover under fallen leaves.  High up
in the trees, amidst the thick boughs, small houses and shops can be seen,
although there doesn't appear to be any way up there from here.

You find yourself inside a large, ancient hollowed out tree.  It barely

entrance into another room, deeper into the tree's trunk.  A soft, warm
light shines from within.  Listening closely, there doesn't appear to be any
sounds of any kind coming from inside, only the rustle of the trees outside
to the south can be heard.

Small sconces with candles lit in them, are nailed to the tree trunk
walls.  In the back of this oval shaped room, sits an old man behind a
table.  He appears to be scribbling something on a piece of parchment.  The
room smells of burning incense, and the air a bit foggy from the burning
sweet sticks.  There doesn't appear to be any other type of furniture around
except for the table in the back where the old man is sitting.

allowing light to shine through.  A few blossoms from the tree's boughs seem

The forest trees have grown wide apart in this area, but their branches
join into a tight mesh canopy overhead.  From the west, a cool breeze
lightly wafts through the area.  A deep resounding hoot emits from a nested
hollow high overhead.  The cleared path continues to the north and south.

An Open Clearing~
Spotted red petals adorn the shrubbery.  Large towering trees surround
you, their upper branches seeming to support the sky above.  A cacophony of
crowing bursts into existence as you enter this area.  The birds screech
ruthlessly from their elevated homes.  From the east, a cool breeze lightly
wafts through the area.

A Well Traveled Intersection~
You have come up to a wide intersection in the forest of Solace.  The
forest trees have grown especially wide apart in this area, but their
branches join into a tight mesh canopy overhead.  From the west, a cool
breeze lightly wafts through the area.  A deep resounding hoot emits from a
nested hollow high overhead.  The cleared trail breaks off in all
directions, continuing on to the north and south on the cleared path.  To
the west, it appears to open up to an even larger clearing, and to the east,
the trees grow closer to the road, making the trail appear to be more used
by an)mals, rather than people.

A Balcony~
You find yourself on a balcony, which is actually built on the outside of
this massive tree.  A roof constructed of large brown leaves hangs overhead.
The walls too, appear to have been constructed of the same leaves, with only
one small opening to serve as a makeshift window.  There are two separate
openings which lead back into the inner portion of the tree itself.  One
entrance leads down a steep and narrow stairway, the other leads into Tika
Waylan's house.

The Smithy~
The door opens into this low roofed smithy.  Traveling further into the
depths of this shop, leads into the close, hot darkness, winding through a
wilderness of anvils and bellows, piles of scrap iron, and stacks of
finished products ranging from horseshoes to delicately wrought railings
destined to grace the balcony of some noblewoman's sitting room.  A fire
roars somewhere deep within the smithy, visible only as a wan red glow
reflecting off the gently sloping ceiling.  An intermittent hammer clangs
out with an awkward rhythm.

parameter of the actual city of Solace itself.  The city has been build high
up into these trees for protection.  A steep set of spiraling stairs leads
downward, back onto the ground.  The rest of the parameter leads to the
south and to the west, traveling along a wooden rope bridge that has been
tied securely to the trees.

The Broken Sword~
You find yourself in a room filled with weapons of all shapes and sizes. 
There doesn't appear to be any fire blazing, nor do you see any weaponsmiths
forging hard steel into fine, sharp weapons.  Upon closer inspection, these
weapons appear to have been used before, with small dings and even an
occasional bloodstain on them.  While these weapons might have been
'acquired' from battlefields, and even though they aren't in too good of
shape, the prices here are at least a lot cheaper than what Theros Ironfeld
charges.  There are even a few pieces of armor for sale as well, although
they are about in just as rough shape as the weapons.

The Western Perimeter of Solace~
You find yourself high up above in the Vallenwood trees, on the western
parameter of the actual city of Solace itself.  The city has been build high
up into these trees for protection.  A steep set of spiraling stairs leads
downward, back onto the ground.  The rest of the parameter leads to the
south and to the east, traveling along a wooden rope bridge that has been
tied securely to the trees.

The Northern Perimeter of Solace~
The wooden rope bridge which makes up the northern parameter of Solace,
is littered with leaves which have fallen from the massive Vallenwood trees.
The bridge appears to be very strong, made of sturdy oak wood and ropes
nearly as thick as an Ogre's thigh.  A soft warm breeze brushes by your
face.  The bridge continues on to the east and to the west.

The Northern Perimeter of Solace~
Loud shrieks of awfully played instruments pierce your ears, the sound
more than obviously coming from the south.  To the south, lies one of the
most dangerous places in Solace to be, the Guild of Bards.  A few
interruptions in the instrument playing does not bring peace and quiet as
one would expect, but rather loud shrills of hoarse vocal chords.  It almost
resembles the sound of a cow being slaughtered for food, or a cat being
lifted up by its tail.  The remainder of the bridge continues on to the
west and to the east, leading to other parts of the great Tree City.

The Guild of Bards~
You find yourself among large quantities of paintings, tapestries, and
other works of art, all hanging off the walls.  The walls have quite a few
branches poking through from the tree this house has been build upon. 
Scores of different musical instruments in a variety of sizes hang from the
walls and sit on the floor.  A few Bards sit around the room in different
places, singing and practicing their instrument skills.  A few of the Bards
can easily be pointed out as beginners, as the sounds coming from their
vocal chords and their instruments, are way out of harmony.

The Northern Perimeter of Solace~
This portion of the wooden bridge stringing along the tree tops of the
great Vallenwood forest, splits off into three directions.  To the south
supposedly lies the famed Thieves Guild.  There doesn't appear to be any
light coming forth from the open doorway.  Only darkness, sending shivers
down the average person's spine.  A small sign hanging over the top of the
doorway clearly states: KEEP OUT!  To the east and west, the bridge
continues on it's merry ol' way.

The Guild of Thieves~
The room is quite dark, darker than most people care to have it.  Only a
soft glow from a small burning candle resting upon a table in the back of
the room, gives any source of light to give you a semi-decent view of your
surroundings.  Climbing and fighting materials adorn the west wall.  The
east wall is used for climbing practice, and the slick floor is used to test
balance.  A thief must be able to fight and move in all situations, among
the trickiest is a virtually smooth surface.  To be able to escape through
a place that your pursuer cannot go gives you the clear advantage.  Various
lock picks and practice locks are also visible on the west wall.  Looking
very carefully, it appears as if the shadows given off from the candle are
moving around you in circles.  Towards the back of the room on the floor, a
small hatch can barely be seen, due to the fact that it sits a bit higher
than the rest of the floor.

Oak Street~
The sounds of laughter and joy echo loudly throughout the air of this
peaceful city.  Resting high up in these large, Vallenwood trees, the city
is very well protected from flooding and other natural disasters.  People
walk by you, most in deep conversations or conducting business deals.  A few
people clench their purses and carrying sacks as a couple of kender walk
cheerfully down the street.  The street is made out of sturdy oak wood.  The
citizens of Solace refused to cut their own trees down to use as supplies to
build this city.  A small alley lies to the east, and the road continues on
to the north and south.

bridge, which serves as one of Solace's streets, is pretty clean.  There are
very few beggars or panhandlers.  People of all races walk freely in
Solace, without the hassle of worrying about discrimination.  The street

Clerics Guild.  The street continues on down haven street, heading in the

The Guild of Clerics~
This building is made of gray stone, but has some very beautiful inlay
work done up near where the ceiling meets the wall.  It's black and white
marble set into the stone of the wall in a herringbone pattern.  It was put
here years ago by a group of clerics that did the work themselves, having
learned the work as children of masons.  They thought that it helped the
clerics to meditate more effectively.  Other than the inlay work, the room
is free of decoration or furniture, save a few soft cushions.  The building
is also free of branches poking through from the tree which it was build up
into.

Vallenwood trees are a marvelous wonder.  Venders and shoppers surround you,
as business continues on all hours of the day.  The street continues on to
the north and south.  The smell of fresh baked goods fills the air with a
sweet aroma.  The delightful odor is coming from inside the building to the
east.  A large sign hanging on a small window says: "Confectionary treats". 
Another sign over the building to the west identifies it as the town
registry.

Vallenwood trees dangle down close by, their leaves falling down on
occasion.  The street continues east and west.  To the north lies the House
of Healing, where weary travelers may go for rest and comfort, and to get
away from the all the violence going on today in this world.

using nature as its decorations.  The branches from the tree on which this
building was built on, grow in wild directions all around the room.  Looking
behind the iron bars placed on top of the desk, stretching up to the
ceiling, sits open a large vault of some sort, a few pieces of steel and
gold coins spilling out of a torn bag.

A Small Shortcut~
You cut through a small shortcut.  While the wooden bridge street here is
shorter, it still hasn't lost any width in comparison to the other streets
in Solace.  The wood is very sturdy, strong enough to carry the weight of a
dragon.  It is constructed from oak wood, as the citizens of Solace refused
to use the Vallenwood trees as a supply source.  The railings are simply,
short logs held together with thick, strong rope.  The shortcut leads
through to Main street when going east, and comes out to Marketplace when
traveling west.  To the north, lies Solace's one of a kind, Music shop.

poultry and fish are quite intoxicating.  Even though the back looks like a
bloody nightmare, like a battlefield after the battle is over and the smoke
is cleared, the rest of this store in front of the counter, is quite clean
and sanitary.  The door west, leads back out into the street.

This part of the market is a little less noisy than the rest.  Perhaps it
is because the Circle of Mages building lies directly to the west, where
mages of all forms of art, and colored robes go to practice and hone their
skills with magic reading and usage.  Oddly enough, there doesn't appear to
be any guards standing by to keep watch over it, perhaps because it would be
an even worse fate for someone who does not practice magic, to make any
attempts at breaking into their place.  The market street continues on to
the north and south, where the crowds are a little louder and higher in
volume.  To the east, lies a small short cut of some sort, leading to the
other side of this magnificent tree city.

The Circle of Magic~
Here you find yourself in a large circular room.  A strange magical
feeling intoxicates your mind.  A few couches lie up against the walls, a
few mages, each wearing a red, white or black robe, sit comfortably with
their head hanging down, either studying a book of magic, or some sort of
magical artifact.  In either case, none of them appears to be friendly enough
to just jump into conversation with, at least not without getting turned
into a frog or worse.  The doorway back east will take you out of here and
back into the always busy streets of Solace.  The remainder of doorways in
here each have a magical symbol over their door, each one representing a
different guild of magic.  To the west, a large bat with its head chopped
off hangs over its door, representing the Guild of Necromancy.  To the
south, an odd clear crystal hangs over its doorway, seeming to change
colors at an astounding rate, representing the Guild of Illusionists.  To
the north, a glimmering dagger hangs above the doorway, representing the
Guild of Enchanters.  Finally, looking up, rather than an object
representing its Guild, the door is not at all a door, but rather a
swimming pool of mass that looks just like a portal of some sort is there. 
That would represent the Guild of Conjuror's.

Here amongst the bustling crowd of traders, citizens, kender and just
ordinary shoppers, you find yourself amidst the center of the market in
Solace.  The loud sounds of people of all races making offers on purchases
ranging from food to furniture, is almost too overwhelming to comprehend
what is being shouted.  Many kender wander around, too many for comfort, not
necessarily placing bids on anything but rather only observing the action
taking place before their always-curious eyes (and hands).  Perhaps it would
be a good idea to tightly grip your belongings closely to your body, before
something "magically" appears in their inventory.  To the north and south,
the street continues along market street. To the east, the hustle and bustle
of traders and shoppers continues on.  To the west, lies the most famous
place in all of Krynn.  The Inn of the Last Home.

Vender's Street~
The citizens of solace gave this street its name due to the abundance of
street vendors who walk around here, selling trinkets, spices, and various
other little knick-knacks and party gifts.  To the north and south, lie two
very powerful guilds, the Battlemage Guild to the north, and the Assassin's
Guild to the south.  Although Hedrick despises assassins, he found that
their services do come quite handy when dealing with unwanted visitors. 
That and the fact that many citizens here are peaceful, and could not
themselves go out and accomplish such a task that an assassin does on a
daily basis.

Entrance into the Inn of the Last Home~
The Inn of the Last Home rests high into the boughs of the largest
Vallenwood tree in Solace.  Worn steps wind around the massive tree trunk,
climbing higher up into the treetops and leading into the Inn itself.  The
sounds of laughter and song being engaged echo down loudly from up above. 
Otik Sandath, famous for his spiced potatoes, is the proud owner of this
fine establishment.  The way out and back into the tree top city lies to the
east.

Marketplace Street~
The sounds of vendors, traders and shoppers alike, echo through the
streets as loud as a bell.  The source of the sound appears to be much
stronger to the south, while nearly non-existent to the north.  To the west,
lies an open doorway to a building made of bricks which have been
constructed from mud.  The doorway leads into the guild of spellfilchers,
where the half-breeds practice both magic and battle tactics.  Marketplace
continues on to the north and to the south.

The Guild of Spellfilchers~
This room has nothing decorative on the walls, save a few scorch marks
and a couple of branches from the Vallenwood tree this building is build
upon lingering through the mud brick walls.  Half of the room is covered
with mats and weapon racks, while the other half has mainly shelves of spell
components and empty floor space.  This is a place for practice, but not
usually sparring, since the room is too small to contain full strength
offensive spells.  Sometimes, though, a student will think that this truism
doesn't apply to them, and try anyway.  They're usually rewarded with a
quick trip to a healer and a scorch mark they can call their own.

Corner of Marketplace and Protector Street~
At the corner of two streets, the wooden walkways here have an odd, but
study design to them.  Connecting each street at a corner is hard work to
do, when working with wood and connecting them high up into large Vallenwood
trees.  A few leaves are scattered about, but other than that, the streets
appear to be quite clean and maintained really well.  The street continues
on to the south, down Marketplace street and also heads west, down Protector
street.

This street appears to be quite clean, no fallen leaves or broken
branches left by hungry squirrels trying to shake the Vallenwood trees for
food.  A large doorway, with two small hand size crossing swords hanging
over it, lies to the north.  The clashing sounds of metal hitting metal ring
from within.  The street continues on to the east and to the west.

The Guild of Knights~
Large swords crossing one another, hang on the wall in the back of this
large and ornate room.  Multiple candles brighten the place up, nearly as
bright as the sun.  A few knights, all seeming to wear Solamnic armor, spar
with each other, furthering their skill proficiency in weapons training. 
Two small tables lie in the back of the room, one in each corner.  The table
tops filled with an assortment of food and drink.  And overlooking training
and everything else conducted here, stands a very tall and prudent looking
man.

Belmont Street~
The large treetops dangle overhead, their leaves occasionally falling
down, some resting upon this wooden bridge, others floating over the sides,
continuing on down to the ground far below.  Aside from a few leaves, this
bridge, which serves as one of Solace's streets, is pretty clean.  There are
very few beggars or panhandlers.  People of all races walk freely in
Solace, without the hassle of worrying about discrimination.  The street
continues on heading north and south.

Belmont Street~
The sounds of laughter and joy echo loudly throughout the air of this
peaceful city.  Resting high up in these large, Vallenwood trees, the city
is very well protected from flooding and other natural disasters.  People
walk by you, most in deep conversations or conducting business deals.  A few
people clench their purses and carrying sacks as a couple of kender walk
cheerfully down the street.  The street is made out of sturdy oak wood.  The
citizens of Solace refused to cut their own trees down to use as supplies to
build this city.  A small alley lies to the west, and the road continues on
to the north and south.

The walkway here gets a little narrow, narrow in comparison to the rest
of the city.  The immediate area is free of the large crowds found in the
markets.  Only the sounds of metal clashing with metal, can be heard ringing
loudly in the air.  The source of the sound is coming from the south, where
the warrior guild lies.  The hustle and bustle of venders and shoppers lies
to the east, and the road continues on around the city to the west.

Large polearms hang on large hooks upon the eastern and western walls. 
The wall in the back appears to be void of any hanging objects, save a few
sconces with long candles lit.  A couple of well-trained warriors spar one
another back in the corner of the room.  Lightly armored with only leather
garments, it's a wonder as to how nobody ever gets hurt around here.

Traveling along a very wide wooden walkway, high up in these tall
Vallenwood trees are a marvelous wonder.  Venders and shoppers surround you,
as business continues on all hours of the day.  The street continues on to
the north and south.

The Living Room~
You find yourself inside of Tika's living room.  It is quite large for
being partially inside of a tree trunk.  There are a few circular tables
accompanied by sturdy oak chairs in three of the corners of the room.  In
the fourth corner, a large, cobblestone fireplace sits, burning a few logs
and displacing a considerable amount of heat.  Towards the back of the room,
lies an empty rocking chair with a small reading book, open and placed
upside down.  To the east of the living room, lies an open doorway, leading,
obviously from the aroma of sweet apple pie wafting from within, to the
kitchen.  To the west lies another open doorway, this one leading to the
only place possibly left, the bedroom.

The Bedroom~
A large bed nearly takes up the entire space of the bedroom.  To the left
of the bed, in the corner, rests a nightstand, with a large white candle
burning slowly.  The wax from the candle drips down onto the wide base of
the silver candleholder.  At the opposite end of the bed, lies a fairly
large chair, complete with leather upholstery and black wooden buttons.  The
bed has been made, not one wrinkle noticeable.  The corner of the thick quilt
has been slightly pulled back, displaying the white feather pillow
underneath.  The bed looks so comfortable, you'd almost swear it was calling
out your name, inviting you to take a nap, even if for just a few minutes.

The odor of sweet apple pie is almost intoxicating in here.  A few pots

A small stove, heated by burning coal, lies off in the opposite corner of
the counters.  Something must be in the oven cooking, as heat waves can be
seen emanating from within.  The floor is scattered lightly with a fresh
coat of flower and many recipe books lie open across the dinner table
located on the southern end of the kitchen.

Two tracks lie before you, tracks obviously made from some sort of wagon.
The trail appears to lead north into the northern farming fields of Solace. 
To the south, the trail leads back into the depths of the great Vallenwood
trees.  Lush green grass grows in between the two tracks, as well as on the
outside of the vestige.

where the farmers of Solace come to harvest their crops to feed the citizens
of Solace.  The field appears to be empty, no farmers swinging their
sickles, rather only small mammals, such as field mice and the like seem to
roam about the fields.

The Northern Farming Fields~
A sea of grain sweeps across the north flats.  Stalks sag with ripened
grain, ready for harvest.  But no one is around to harvest the grains or
tend the crops.  A few small mammals can be seen, scurrying to and fro
through the thick grain stalks.

You find yourself up high in the only tree that seems to occupy the
farming fields, high away from danger.  A few birds, perched upon the thick
boughs, chirp away.  Looking down, appears to be too dangerous to try to
climb back to the ground.  Your only way to safe haven seems to be up, but
where does it lead to?

This tidy store has the smell of flour in the air.  Plates of sweets for
sale are all around the small shop.  Though mostly from local recipes, the
cookies and candies are all tasty, or Sarah wouldn't have been able to keep
this shop open for so long.  Once you've tasted her handiwork, you'll
realize that it puts all others to shame.  The door west leads back to Main

You find yourself in an open-air walkway.  The door to the north leads
into the Inn itself, where heading east or west, will take you further down
the walkway, which surrounds the entire Inn on the outside of the tree.  The
floors are old and wooden, but very sturdy.  A fresh coat of polish has been
recently applied to them, giving it a brilliant lustre.  A warm breeze
floats in through a small open window, somewhere on the walkway.

east.  A small open window allows a warm breeze to float in and blow past
your face.  The wooden floor has a brilliant shine to it, most likely a new
coat of oil was applied for lustre and preservation.  This walkway serves
more as a front porch or patio than anything else.

The wooden floor here has a fresh coat of oil, giving it a brilliant lustre.
There appears to be a large splinter poking up.  Careful, don't want to step
on it, as it looks like it would leave a nasty scar.  A warm breeze blows
past your face, blowing in from one of the small windows set throughout the
entire walkway.

The Bar Area~
A well polished bar weaves about several living branches over to the east
side of the room, and the mouth-watering smell of Otik Sandath's spiced
potatoes drifts from the kitchen to mingle with the high quality ale he
sells.  A few barmaids rush up to get the drinks ordered by the heavily
intoxicated customers, throw them on their trays, and dash off in a hurry to
deliver the fine ale.  The patrons in this establishment appear to be
sitting at tables in the lounge to the north.

An Open-Air Walkway~
You find yourself along a fairly wide walkway.  The wooden floor has been
freshly coated with oil, giving it a shiny look.  Small windows have been
cut out from the outer wall, allowing fresh air to seep in.  The ceiling
appears to have been constructed out of large leaves, probably those from
these large Vallenwood trees this city has been build up in.  The sounds of
laughter and drunken singing can be heard echoing through the tree trunk. 
The hallway continues on to the north and south.

You find yourself loitering at the bottom of a winding, wooden staircase.
The staircase leads up to a guest room, although you can't quite remember
ever seeing anyone ever pay to stay there.  The stairs look old, but sturdy.
They too have a fresh coat of oil, a sure sign that Otik likes to take care
of his place.  The open-air hallway lies to the east.

You find yourself loitering at the top of a wooden, spiral staircase. 
The stairs look to be old, but standing and even jumping up and down on any
of them, prove that they're quite sturdy, possibly even strong enough to hold
the weight of a small dragon.  The wooden floor here has a brilliant shine
to it, created by the fresh coat of oil that was applied early in the
morning.  There doesn't appear to be one speck of dust or any lingering
cobwebs lying around anywhere.  A short hallway lies to the south, leading
to a guest room.  Down the spiral stairs will take you to an open-air
walkway.

a few paintings hanging on the walls to make people feel a little more at
home, rather than away from it.  There aren't any windows here, yet you can
still feel a warm breeze flowing in from somewhere.  Heading north will take
you to the top of a staircase which leads down into an open-air walkway.

A Small Guest Room~
Quite a large room for guests to sleep in, this room has it all.  A large
king size bed lies towards the back of the room.  A large table with a
lantern lit on it, sits next to the bed.  There's even a large dresser for
guests to keep their clothes in here.  The floor not only has a fresh coat
of oil, but also has a coat of wax on top of it to help prevent scratching. 
A few paintings of wildlife have been hung in a neat fashion on the walls. 
There is a fairly large window off to the west, with a pane of glass
embedded to keep harsh weather from seeping in and bringing discomfort to
the guest.  The room is quite cozy and almost makes you want to lay down and
take a nap, but just a short one.  The door to the north leads back out into
the hallway.

The Kitchen~
The clanking of pots and pans rings loudly throughout this small kitchen.
A few cooks, hired by Otik to help out during busy times, scurry back and
forth from the stove to the cupboards and icebox.  Frantically trying to
cook as fast as they can, flower, sugar, potatoes and many other particles of
food fling wildly through the air, nearly hitting you in the face.  Perhaps
it would be a good idea not to disturb them and be on your merry way.  What
are you doing in here anyways?  Observing to become a great chef yourself
some day?

The Lounge~
A few waitresses hurry by you, bringing drink and food to the Inn's
patrons.  A few tables, most of them already taken, are tightly packed in
this part of the lounge.  The sounds of joy and laughter ring loudly in the
air, rising out of the lungs of drunken customers.  The floor, although
always freshly oiled every morning, already has quite a few scuff marks, the
heavy toll of many people walking across it and the occasional bar fight
being the culprits.  There are no windows in here, and the mix between
Otik's potatoes and other various foods, and the occasional smoker, linger
heavily in the room.  To the west, lies an open doorway, leading into the
Inn's storage room.  A heavy blast of warm air blows in from the north,
where the lounge stretches on, leading into the part of the Inn where a
large fireplace burns all day and all night.

A large stone fireplace has been built into the northern wall.  A great
fire has been lit, providing an adequate amount of heat and light for the
entire Inn.  A few tables and chairs lie around the room, some empty, others
occupied.  In the corner of the room, where the light almost seems to fail
to work, a table with only two chairs is occupied by two men who look very
familiar.  Upon closer inspection, you realize who you're looking at.  In
one chair sits Seeker Hederick, Theocrat of Solace and Leader of the Seekers
in the town.  In the other chair, a white haired man who almost looks
familiar sits.  You think you know who he is, but just can't seem to place a
name.  To the west lies a small bedroom, although it is not recommended by
the waitresses to go in there.  The lounge stretches on to the south.

and barrels of whine and ale are kept.  There are also a few neatly stacked
chairs placed in here, in case they run out of room and need to seat more
people.  A stock boy stands in the back of the room, with a piece of paper
and a quill pen, taking inventory of everything in here.  So much for
stealing a few barrels of alcohol.  The only exit in the entire room lies
to the east, leading back out into the lounge.

A Small Bedroom~
If any of the Inn's workers or even worse, if Otik himself caught you
inside here, you'd definitely be thrown out and never allowed to come back
in to the Inn for the rest of your life.  The room is void of any
decorations.  It only has a simple bed and a small nightstand with a small
candle and candleholder upon it.  In fact, this room could very well be the
dullest room in the entire city of Solace.  Aren't you glad your risking
your stay by taking a peek?

Almost totally dark, this room is lit only by a single tallow candle. 
Necromancers move all around you, silently, except when a student falls or
trips on some of the furniture that's spread around the room to make
training more difficult.  Near the candle, students work on how to mix
lethal potions into food and drink so that its flavor cannot be detected. 
Some animal noises from the southwest corner of the room are coming from
caged animals that are used as demonstrations of the potency of deadly
necromantic magic.  Occasionally, the clink of a metal dagger hitting the
stone floor can be heard, along with the mumbled curses that go along with
it.

large padded mat graces the center of the room for combat practice.  As you
look at the flowers, you notice that they're also a training exercise. 
They're not all fresh, some have just been enchanted to appear so.  It's an
ongoing task of the young students to keep the flowers here and in the other
room looking as if they were just brought inside from a dewy morning.  Even
the branches from the Vallenwood tree which this building is build upon,
stick through the walls with leaf buds sprouting out.

reading corner has a thick pad for practicing falls with new students.  The
ceiling is scorched and chipped in certain places, where spells went
horribly wrong or amazingly well.

waves.  They make those who haven't mastered their perception, feel dizzy. 
The room is very simple, with chests for weapons and scrolls, and a padded
mat for combat practice.  Every once in a while, something new will appear
in the room that wasn't there before.  Sometimes it is eaten, sometimes
killed, sometimes used, and sometimes just forgotten about.  Nothing
surprises a conjuror.

on the walls, ceiling, and floor.  Big chunks of stone have also been taken
out of the walls.  When battlemages practice, they practice hard.  Vender
street lies directly to the south, out the front door.

equipment at all suddenly grips your heart with a cold chill.  A few daggers
are scattered around the room, some on the floor, others stuck in the walls.
A few spots of blood soak into the wooden floor.  The door to the north

learn and practice can be done here, no additional implements are needed. 
Even food can be gathered here, from the berries that grow on some of the
bushes.  The forest trails continue on through the forest of Solace to the

The only thing in the room aside from the dirty rugs, is a large, white
cauldron.  Upon closer inspection, pieces of bat wings and whole snakes, can
be seen floating at the top.  The smell is powerful enough to knock out an

Inside of this large house, built high up into the Vallenwood trees, are
vast varieties of ornate and healing items.  Burning incense fills the room,
giving the room a delightful odor and a feeling of tranquility.  A large
altar rests upon a step of some sort, raising it higher than the rest of the
furniture.  Upon the altar is a large statue of a platinum Dragon, the
representation of the Father of Good, Paladine.  In front of it, lies a
donation chest, there to help out the needy, not the greedy.  To the south,
lies the door out of here, leading back out into the bustling markets of
Solace.

Around Crystalmir Lake~
The road here is well traveled by farmers and merchants.  Fields run the
parameter of the road on either side.  Tiny settlements can be seen out in
these fields, farmers tending to their crops.  Small buildings of three to
five make up these small settlements.  A few merchants make their way down
the road, some walking alone with their belongings hanging off their robes,
and others, with a team of horses dragging a wagon behind them.  Off to the
west, a large body of water known as Crystalmir Lake can be seen.  The road
continues to the north and to the south.

Around Crystalmir Lake~
The road here is well traveled by farmers and merchants.  Fields run the
parameter of the road on either side.  Tiny settlements can be seen out in
these fields, farmers tending to their crops.  Small buildings of three to
five make up these small settlements.  A few merchants make their way down
the road, some walking alone with their belongings hanging off their robes,
and others, with a team of horses dragging a wagon behind them.  To the
northwest, a large body of water known as Crystalmir Lake can be seen.  The
road bends around a corner here, leading to the north and to the west.

Outside the Sentinel Peaks~
Here the trail bends around a tight corner, leading west into the vast
mountain ranges, known to the local commoners as the Sentinel Mountains. 
Towards the south, the trail heads into what appears to be open farming
fields, small houses scattered about in no particular fashion.

settlements of farmers.  Two to three farmhouses lie scattered about in no
particular fashion.  A few merchants travel along this road, passing by, not
saying a word.  Farther out, bordering the fields lay towering mountains,
known as the Sentinel Mountains.

A Living Shrine to Zivilyn~
A vallenwood of gargantuan proportions stands here, its trunk spanning
more than thirty feet across.  The surrounding area is teeming with an
enormous variety of flowers that seem to be in perpetual bloom year-round. 
An alcove has been carefully hollowed out in the center of the trunk,
containing an altar sculpted from the surrounding wood; part of the living
tree itself.  An aura of peaceful harmony fills the air, as this living
symbol of Zivilyn invites all who visit to pay homage to the god of all
wisdom.

An Open-Air Market~
This large open area has been set aside to accomodate the number of
travelling artisans from all over Ansalon who visit the city to sell their
wares and services.  A number of merchant stalls have been erected around
the perimiter, with a large firepit near the western end for use by
travelling smiths.  Here, various smiths, jewellers, leatherworkers and
other craftsmen compare their handiwork and compete for patrons before
moving on to the next town.
