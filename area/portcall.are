child dirty barefoot~
a dirty child~
A dirty, barefoot child walks past you.
~
A small child, who is quite thin from lack of eating proper meals, plays
nearby.  The look on his face shows that life is hard but not impossible to
live with.  His clothes are dirty, and has no shoes on his mud, caked feet. 
The only reason that his clothes are in such good repair, is because it
probably came from one of the missionaries that you have seen wandering the
area.

than the wicked looking dagger in his hand, he is plainly dressed, and only
wears a leather tunic for protection.

youths kneel off to the side with their concentration on a dice game, where
the pot is a stack of several steel coins.  The citizens of the city are
rarely seen walking down this road, unless they are looking to have a rowdy
time.

jail.  The minotaur seems to have put up a very large fight before the

over a horse dead.  All of the men have their hands on their weapons even
though the minotaur's hands are bound behind his back.  To the north and

sends a flame out of the bagpipes and into the air.  The flame burns off
the guard's facial hair and catches the gnome's own beard on fire.

A group of drunken sailors pass by, singing songs at the top of their

through the streets carrying away the foul stench of rotten fish in the
area.  A seagull lands on a post sitting next to the road and eats it latest

You stand on waterfront road.  To the north, you hear laughter coming from
behind a door.  The windows are painted black so no peeking in is allowed. 
Hanging above the door is a battered sign with a picture of a chalice and a
pile of steel coins lying beside it.  Just then the door opens abruptly and
the barman of the establishment throws out a young man onto the street. 
Picking himself off the ground, he staggers off down the street to the next
bar.

Another ship has just arrived and the crew is eager to enjoy their freedom. 
The warehouses and unloading dock is to the south.  With so many deckhands
heading inland for some rest and relaxation, it’s a wonder how all those
ships get their cargo taken care of.

If you do not see the captain waiting here to take on passengers, wait
patiently and he will soon arrive.  Once the ship pulls into the dock, be

sailors run towards the town, ready to spend their first night on land in
many days, in one of the many waterfront bars.  A ship's captain trails
behind them at a slower pace, for his business is with the harbor master. 
If he is lucky, he will not have to pay any steel to bail out in crew, or
even have to find a new crew to replace the trouble makers.

Ocean Way~
A bush rustles to the side of the road, a small cat runs out of the bush,
followed very closely by a beagle.  They both run a little up the road then
head straight off into the shrubs again.  To the south you can see the
ocean.  This section of Ocean way has very little foot travel, except for
those couples who walk the shoreline hand in hand.

all the fishermen land their boats here to keep out of the way of the nobles
and their problems.  To the north of you is the large slum area of the city
giving haven to the poor and criminals alike.  The road is one of the lesser
traveled areas in the city due to the crime here, even the town militia do
not come here unless in force.

As the years passed, so did the upkeep of the roadway here.  Potholes
are starting to form where the stones have cracked and worn away.  On the
breeze the smells of the sea and trash in the streets come to your nose. 
This barren, seldom traveled path stretches from the north and continues on
toward the east.

attention on the dice game that they are playing.  This dirty road continues

As the road angles from the north and heads east, one can see the
beginnings of a cobble stone road.  Only from the recent labors of a road
crew, the road  has a little stone left to it.  The stump of a tree
stands off to the side of road which is covered in carvings.  Ivy also
covers the old stump, and if not for the rings in the grain, the stump would
pass for a boulder.

Atenbury road.  The route that takes you to a run down part of the city runs
to the north and south on Heathen way.  The foot traffic in this area is a
mixture of riff raff and the good citizens of the fair city.  Overlooking
all these people and ensuring the safety of the streets are the city guard.

around and head off from where they came not daring to enter here without
proper reason.  The area known as the Slums can be entered easily to the

red marble veined in black, with black banners draped amongst the ceiling;
depicting the symbol of a huge condor.  Here, minotaur warriors and soldiers
of the dragonarmies come to pay homage to Sargonnas, god of vengeance and
destruction.  In the center of this temple room, lies a large marble podium,
with a large silver condor on top.

wings are spread, as if in mid-flight.  This condor is the holy symbol
revered by worshipers of the great Evil God, Sargonnas.  An enscription lies
at the base of the podium the Condor rests upon.  It reads:

vile act and leave the scene is almost unthinkable.  A quick glance around
shows muddy footprints leading to the north.

Grave of the Blue Dragon Army's Warlord ~
A granite crypt crafted by the best human stonemasons rest here on
hallow ground.  For in death all are equal, only the path of their spirit is
in question.  The crypt lid is carved in the image of the dead leader,
another life like creation by an unknown artisan.  For the figure lays as
if he still wears his armor, with his shield and sword upon his chest.

Spooky Graveyard~
The plots here are few and far between with lots of room for future use. 
A couple of gravediggers are walking from the south with a shovel and pick
over their shoulders.  One is carrying a lantern while the other carries his
lunch in a pail.  Their work does not seem to dampen their spirit in this
place.  One tells the other a bawdy tale about two women and a drunken priest.

Spooky Graveyard~
Not all the sections of this graveyard bring a peace to ones spirit. 
Instead, they send an uncontrollable shiver up your spine, for the place
fills you with dread.  The grasses look to have been burned away here, and
only the wildest weeds are able to grow in the parched earth.  Among these
weeds are creeping vines with many sharp thorns that will draw blood at the
slightest touch.

Spooky Graveyard~
For some who could not afford a marker, other items were used instead.  A
sword with its blade thrust into the ground and a rusting helm perched on
top of it serves as a marker for one such grave.  A sky blue ribbon, now
tattered for the winds and weather, has been tied to the hilt.  The sword is
plain looking, but is in far better condition than the helm for the only
rust upon it comes from the helmet itself.

Tomb of an Unknown Hero~
Much like the tomb in Solace, this one has been dedicated to a fallen
hero.  Little is known about this strange warrior, for the Solamnic Knights
in which he fought for have no knowledge of him.  No one knew his name or
from where he called home, but his actions made up for his secrets.  In the
few moments of a last defense before the Blue Dragonarmy, he stood with
honor and courage, refusing to retreat even when his fellows left him.  It
were these deeds that the Knights of Takhisis witnessed first hand and gave
him a proper burial.

As the muck of a path continues, so do the end lines of beggars.  You
wonder if the city guard would reward those who would end these people's
sufferings.  Many houses are crammed together in the smallest amount of room
possible.  These homes are smaller than most one-room homes and on average
have a family of eight living in them.  A path leads to the west and south.

shouts out a jeer.  To this the prophet sputters with anger and the people
gathered around laugh all the more.  The path journeys to the west, north,

A muddy path more than a road, runs to the north and south and is
littered with trash.  Since a couple of shacks have now been torn down, the
path also continues to the east.  One must have a cold heart or no wealth,
for beggars line the path waiting for handouts.  If a kind soul comes
around, they will soon be overwhelmed by the desperate folk.

Coming to a bend in the path, it curves from the north and continues on
toward the east and south.  As you travel further, the beggars lessen in
number, but there are far too many for a city of this size.  Many lost their
homes during the war, as well as hope.  A few missionaries from time to
time, try and lend aid to those who are in need.

The homes here could be described as being shacks, made from an
assortment of scrap wood, hemp rope, and cloth tarps.  The path leads to the
north as well as to the east and west.  This southern section of the slums
is depressing, but does seem cleaner than other areas.  As to answer your
thoughts, a gully dwarf appears from one of the shacks carrying a sack full
of trash.

of the elves of Qualinesti.  Docking gates are mounted on the north and
