sand serpent~
a Sand Serpent~
A Sand serpent slithers across the sand and over your feet.
~
Slithering around with the stealth of a persons shadow, this sandy
colored snake like creature has a narrow body and yet it's head is fairly
large, with sharp fangs just barely hanging out of it's mouth.  Being
heavily camouflaged, you almost didn't see it.  However, when it slithered
across your feet, you couldn't help but look down to see what this thing
was.

rat catcher~
a Steel-plated Self-destructive rat catcher~
A Steel-plated Self-destructive Rat Catcher is here snooping around the area.
~
Another one of those Gnomish inventions, these things seemed to have
grown quite popular among Gnomes here in Mt Nevermind simply because half
the time they actually work, catching unwanted rats then self detonating,
killing the rat it caught and sometimes even unknowing on-lookers, usually
curious Kender.  Mechanical in design, it almost looks to be an actual
living creature, with the exception to it's steel plated body.  Perhaps you
better be careful around these things.  Gnomes aren't notorious for creating
inventions that work properly, let alone work, and this thing might just
explode at any time.

A giant spider~
A giant spider sits here, feeding off its last kill.
~
Don't be nice to spiders, because they sure won't be nice to you. 
Shouldn't be too difficult though, just give 'em a good old fashioned
pounding with something painful.  It's body being completely black with
long, hairy legs, it gives you a feeling of fear as you watch it devour the
corpse of some poor young child you wandered into this things path unknowing
of the consequences.

a Mechanized Warrior~
A steam-powered Mechanized Warrior stands before the gate, keeping a look out.
~
Steam seeps out of it's ears as you begin to stare at this ---- thing. 
It appears to be something invented by the Gnomes who live and die here, as
a means of protection.  Gnomes not having enough time to cut out from their
lifequest to do such boring duties, it doesn't come as a surprise to you that
they would make something like this, obviously mechanized gate guard. 
Although it appears to move slow, there's no doubt in your mind that it
probably has some devastating fighting skills.

Never having seen one of these rare creatures, you don't know much about
them except for what you can see right now.  Large fang like teeth and razor
sharp claws don't look too appealing to your comfort and his large muscles
on his, already large worm like body, only bring more fear into your soul. 
He appears to be surrounded by some sort of aura, as if he was brought here
by the Gnomes to look after their mountains safety.

in a yellow toga and bare footed, he doesn't appeal to you as important
enough to stop and talk to.

Sancrist Bay~
Stretching north over the waters of the Sirrion Sea, is a wooden dock
which seems to be the only way on and off this island.  As you stand here,
sand starts to fill your boots making it seemingly difficult to walk
through.  Perhaps you'd better start moving before you sink right through
the beach, never again to be seen.

As you continue to trudge forth on your long walk around the island, sand

A path leading to Mt. Nevermind~
The ground feels a lot more stable beneath your feet, as the sand turns
into more of a clay type terrain.  Looking around, you find yourself coming
closer and closer to the large mountain.  Perhaps now it would be a good
idea to start looking for the entrance; considering from hearsay and rumors,
the gnomes tried to make it as difficult to find as it is to find the
entrance to the Tower of Wayreth.

A path outside the gates of Mt. Nevermind~
Not totally positive about where your at, you could swear the Gnomes have
failed again at an attempt to cloaking their beautiful mountain, for you
seem to be walking down the direct path which leads to the entrance.  A
little more optimistic about where you are, you may head east or west.

Before the great gates of Mt. Nevermind~
You find yourself standing before a large set of gates.  They seem to be
open, an invitation to all who care to wander in and put up with the burden
that all Gnomes seem to carry with them of never being able to complete out
of their LifeQuest.  Listening closely, sounds of metal clanking against
metal as well as a few gibbering Gnomish voices echo off the walls and into
your ears.  Mechanical devices moving, gears turning and the occasional
scream of a Gnome remind you of some freakish experiment gone bad.  Perhaps
heading east into the great Mountain doesn't sound as exciting as you
thought it would be.  Perhaps you'd better turn around and head back west.

A path through a forest~
Off the sandy beaches you go, and right into a heavy thicket of trees. 
Tall aspen trees surround you as the trail continues on, heading north and
south.  Going north will take you back to the trail leading around Mt
Nevermind, and going south will take you through the remainder of the
Sancrist Island.

Volcano which Gnomes call home.  To the west, the Dock continues on to where
a Minotaur Captain pulls in his great Galleon to ferry passengers across the

only ship you see, is a massive one which appears to be docked a little ways
out in the water, leaving the only way to get off of hear is with your own
boat or to fly.

Inside the gates of Mt. Nevermind~
You stand just inside the great Gates of Mt.  Nevermind.  A Volcano, long
since dead and inhabited by the always thinking, always creating, always
inventing Gnomes.  The unpleasant smell of Steam fills your nose and clouds
your vision somewhat.  The sounds of metal clanking against metal as well as
a few gibbering Gnomish voices echo off the walls and into your ears. 
Mechanical devices moving, gears turning and the occasional scream of a
Gnome reminds you of some freakish experiment gone bad.  The sounds get
louder heading east and seem to, somewhat, go away further out west, through
the massive Gates which stand before you.

Inside Mt. Nevermind~
Deeper and deeper into the tunnels of this extravagant Mountain you go. 
Heading west will take you to the gates which lead out of this place and
going east will take you into the Gnomish lifestyle.  You can also make out
a small tunnel which leads down, with a small sign posted right next to the
entrance.

You appear to be walking in a tunnel filled with green moss.  The
moss appears to be lighting up the cave just enough to give you a good look
as to where your going, without a torch.  The smell of something burning, a
new invention the gnomes created or perhaps the entire Mountains themselves,
fill you nostrils.  Looking further down, the tunnels go deeper and deeper.

In front of the Deep Tunnel Gates~
In front of you is the gate which leads into the Deep Tunnels of Mt. 
Nevermind.  There is an old Gnome standing before you, known as the
Gatekeeper.  On certain occasions he will be available to you for advice
during your explorations in the uncharted tunnels deep below Mount
Nevermind.  Before the gate is a sign, which perhaps you'd better read
before entering, or perhaps you should turn back before it's too late.

As you walk closer to the source of the dim light, you notice a change in
the air.  It's not stale anymore, although it can hardly be described as
"fresh".  Cautiously, you peek around a bend in the tunnel.  A cave opens up
before you, with walls covered with some kind of thick fungus which seems to
be giving off the dim light, just enough to provide visibility throughout
the cave.  A small heap of something lies on the floor in the middle of the
cave.  Two exits are visible in the opposite wall.

You walk away from the heap into a long and narrow passage, where you
have to duck frequently to avoid obstacles from the ceiling.  As you crawl
under a huge boulder, you hear a faint noise from ahead.  Carefully, you
move closer to an opening in the wall, and risk a quick peek around the
corner.  The roar from the draconian that was hiding in there makes your
skin crawl.  Your newfound enemy throws a large stone at you, but your
reflexes are good enough to dodge it.  'There must be a way out!  ' you say
to yourself, but the only realistic option is the tunnel ahead -and the
Draconian stands between you and it...  Of course, you could always try to
bribe your way out.

As you squeeze through a narrow entrance, a small sound from above is

the end of your adventures - which is a pity, since the heap of gold in the
next, adjacent room is enough to buy Mt.  Nevermind.

The floor here is covered with debris, and you watch your steps very
carefully as you proceed through the tight turns of the tunnel.  You step
through what has possibly once been a door and yelps when a voice thunders
through the corridor.  You turn your head this way and that, trying to
locate the owner of the voice -to no avail.  You try to turn back and run
away, but your legs are numb...  Petrified, you try frantically to find
some...  Thing to which the booming voice might belong.  -Something
nice-looking, for preference.  Somehow you haven't noticed the large
cupboard by the left wall until now.  It's quite big.

When you leave the cupboard behind you, the voice follows you from a
distance, cursing you and calling you names.  Suddenly, a bright light
surrounds you, blinds you, and you feel a shiver through your body.  As the
light disappears, you are able to see again.  You do not, however, recognize
anything you see...  You are standing in a clearly lit room.  The walls are
far apart, and made in some bluish metal that gleams in the light.  In the
middle of the room is a large...  Thing, which you very cautiously walk up
to, all the time prepared to run away from whatever it is.  Where you would
run TO is an open question, since the walls appear to be solid, without any
openings at all.

The world goes fuzzy for a second, and You feel a quick, falling

another cave -this one even larger than the one You just left.  There's
something in Your hand.  Closer examination show it to be Your new
Certificate as Junior Operator, and after a short admiring look at it, You
tuck it away in a pocket.  You notice that you are surrounded by four
caskets, each made from black marble and polished almost beyond shiny.  Do
You chose The one making You feel comfortable or The one that makes You feel
cold or The one making You feel uncomfortable or The fourth one

While it makes You feel clearly uncomfortable, this casket draws Your
attention in a way that none of the other does, and as You touch it, the
other three disappears.  Oh, well.  Nothing much to do about Your choice
now, then.  The air above the casket shimmers, and an image appears in front
of You.  "You are an Engineer", intones the vision.  "If this is truly so,
then You will be able to solve my riddle with little or no effort."  The
Image is very clear for an instant, and You back away, horrified at the
sight.  "Otherwise, You will be mine to enjoy..!"  "Now, answer me this:"
"How many Gnomes does it take to change a light bulb?"  
Make Your choice: 
1. One, and five more to fend off any committee trying to help!
2. A Committee, and the chairman's nephew (for experience points)!
3. We'll have the kender put it back in!
4. Just Me!

Of course!  It is important to know that the Committee, whatever else it
may be, is there to support You in Your work and provide You with their
valuable experience.  It is equally important to know when to ask for their
assistance!  You have passed Your first test as an Engineer, and even as you
read this, Your colleagues are performing the time-honored preparations for
adding Your name in the Mt Nevermind Junior Engineer's Guild Ledger.  (As
soon as they agree about how the quill should be sharpened).

in the center of the chamber, and some ten minutes later you have found your
way to it, having had a close call on free flight a couple of times getting
here.  In the center of the platform is a hole, with an old stepladder
disappearing down the darkness.  An odd feeling make you turn and look
behind you, where the walls are closing in on you.  You decide to climb down
the ladder, at least to get your head below the danger.

Quoting your Mechanics teacher, "Nothing beats a Gnome -except possibly a

shoulders, and find a fairly comfortable seat there.  Unsure of what to do
now, since nothing unpleasant seems to be happening, you begin to examine
the statue more carefully.  In the back of the statue's head is a small
green button, and no matter how hard you look you can't find anything else
that should not be on a statue.  Bracing yourself, you push the button.

The Gnome statue starts to rumble, and You wonder briefly how it will
feel to be in the very center of an explosion.  Your ponderings are
interrupted by a wheezing voice from the statue: "You are the first person
to choose correctly in fifteen years.  I congratulate Your skill to reach a
correct conclusion based on very little facts."  The enormous head turns to
face you, and a thin sheet of paper comes out from a wrinkle in its
forehead, accompanied by a rattling sound.  "Do not loose this report!  It
is proof that You are eligible for taking the tests to become Senior
Operator, so keep it safe!"  You take the paper, smooth it out over the
brow of the statue, and read it.  It's the real thing, no doubt about it. 
By accident, you have selected the correct route to this room, and are one
of a very small number of People to have the opportunity to make it all the
way to Senior Operator.  And only yesterday, you were cleaning tables for a

going down.  Keep your fingers crossed, maybe today the elevator is working
and you won't have to travel up the long, steep stairwell.

Tinker street~
Down Tinker street your travel.  The streets are clean, not littered with
junk and roaming beggars who do nothing but clutter the streets and then ask
for a reward of gold just for standing there.  Small torches line the large
and tall cavernous walls which make up the passage ways for these streets. 
To your north, you see a sign, with a big number one on it.  What could that
possibly mean?  Perhaps it's the local place of business where all of the
Gnomes stop to do their banking at.

Intersection at Tinker and Adventure street~
You find yourself at what has to be, the largest intersection in this
clean city.  Making quick observations of your surroundings, you can see
you'll have to go north or south if you wish to travel down Adventure
street.  Crowds of people can be heard chit chatting to one another.  Going
west will take you down Tinker street, a well lighted and clean street with
no beggars standing on the curb trying to squeeze a few gold coins out of
your purse.  However, if you see any kender, it'd be wise to turn around and
start walking in the opposite direction.  Immediately to your east, lies a
large, arched doorway.  The curves appear to be smooth, each side
symmetrical to each other.  Through the archway, lies the great room of the
Committee.  A place where Gnomes go to for political matters, but more
importantly, to be reviewed of their LifeQuests.  It also appears to be a
place for healing and sacrifices, which are all made in the name of Reorx.

the Committee Room~
Welcome fellow adventurer.  You have stumbled upon the Committee room,
where at least three or more Gnomes, discretely chosen, come to review new
inventions from which have been created by Gnomes fulfilling their
LifeQuests.  Being here in the presence of these Gnomes is in itself, an
honor.  Perhaps, if your lucky enough, one day you might actually get to be
a part of their "Ultimate Plan".  Looking around, you notice that there's
only three Gnomes running the committee right now.  Perhaps they're short
handed and might need help, that is if you have what it takes.  There
appears to be a sign hanging on the south wall which reads, " Newbies may
proceed here to begin with their LifeQuests ".  Yes, that means if your a
newbie, you best be high tailing it south!  
 
(* You may go DOWN to Newbie School if level 5 or below. )

You find yourself walking down this wide street, named after the
almighty Committee.  A team of gnomes who've already, by some miracle,
completed their lifequest, and are now in charge of making the decision as
to what new inventions are to be build and inspect the ones that are claimed
to be completed (although they rarely ever get an approval of completion). 
Heading on north will take you to a corner in the street and going south

is gleaming bright, as mechanical figures constantly go up and down,
ensuring it is properly swept and washed daily.  You almost feel out of
place, as if your not worthy to step foot on it, however looking around and
not seeing anyone watching you, you continue on.  To the north is a dark
alley, which may provide some sort of cover if your being hunted down for.

their lifequest, and are now in charge of making the decision as to what

screaming coming from within, it seems like they're doing it the hard way. 
Well, better that than nothing at all.

pudgy little Gnome, holding a beaker in one hand and some sort of small
device held together by nuts, bolts and screws.  As you walk in expecting to

that there's no place to sit except on the floor.  The Gnome puts his things

hang all about the room, but being in a Gnome shop, it doesn't come to you
as a surprise.  There's no desk to be seen, let alone an area that’s not
cluttered with junk to put one at.  A small door in the back room opens up,
possibly operated by steam, and out comes a small, stout Gnome from within. 
Almost immediately detecting your presence, he starts looking around,
counting each and every object in the room, as if he thinks you may have
swiped something off his shelves while he wasn't looking.

keeping an accurate account of it's wealth.  You'll rarely find Gnomes
coming in here, for the need of gold is almost obsolete.  Instead, the
Gnomes rely on the resources of the Mountain for supplies.  Gold is only
needed for those rare occasions in which a Gnome must travel outside the
mountain to obtain crucial information to complete his or her LifeQuest. 
You may deposit any amount of gold or silver you wish to get of and it shall
be kept safe, away from any thieving fingers.

aisles meander through enough parchment to wallpaper the entire city of
Palanthas.  Also home to the Genealogy Committee, a mass of gnomes can be
heard bustling about sorting and resorting records by name, guild,
Lifequest, and every other category one could think of.  Every so often,
after sorting things into insensibility, fresh copies are made and the whole
process begins anew.  At the front of the room, a large stack of
applications for citizenship stands ready to be filled out in triplicate
under the watchful eye of the Census-taker.

this high temperature room, is a short little Gnome forming out a piece of
raw steel into a shining bright new shield.  After a careful examination of
some of his displays, your reassured that the shields which he makes exceed
beyond most knights requirements.  Perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to
purchase one and try it out for yourself.

latourcurrentratespernightyoudbeafoolnotoothefeeforonenightisfreethatsright-
folksfreenowwhileroomslast ".  
Standing behind a small desk, sits an old Gnome reading a book. There's a
set of stairs leading up, perhaps you should go up and check to see if
there's any more available rooms left.

Temple of the Living Flame~
Welcome, fellow clerics!  Before you is a small shrine, lit by an
ever-burning golden flame, built to honor and pay respects to Sirrion, God
of Creativity and Passion.  Standing here with her head bowed in prayer is a
slim, small woman dressed in robes of red and gold.  She looks up and smiles
at you as you bless her with your presence.  A feeling of warmth and comfort
overcomes you as make your way further into this room of clerical power. 
Please, sit down and make yourself at home and if your feeling frisky, the
healer here will aid you in the training of your special attributes.

Entrance to the Arena~
You are standing at the entrance to an Arena.  You may proceed through
while still young, to advance and better train your abilities.  However,
train them well now, for after you reach maturity, you will no longer be
allowed to come here and will have to search elsewhere in the world for the
proper training.  May your travels and adventures come safe and have fun. 
Kill as much as you like, the blood can never overflow in the Arena.
