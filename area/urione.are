The water is dark, yet unbelievably clear.  Large coral formations can be
seen all around, while small schools of fish swim in tight formations to
help ward off predators.  The sea floor is littered with large shells and
small sand dollars.  A few large sharks swim overhead, awaiting the
opportunity to snag the next thing that will sate their hunger.

A chillness sweeps over anything that swims too far from the warmth of
the volcanic vents.  Though the vents give off heat, they also give off
toxic fumes that could be deadly if one is not adapted to them.  Crustaceans
and small fish swim eagerly around, picking off the dying and the young.  A
pack of barracuda swim overhead, eyeing the situation.

The lowest level of the spiral city appears to have many entrances.  A
number of glowing pumpkin-sized globes can be seen, attached at intervals to
the overhead stonework.  A closer examination of the walls show that the
pink granite is very thick; as it must be, to support such a huge structure.
Attempting to peer up to the top would only make one dizzy.

Appearances can be deceiving, in the fact that this large structure that
rises from the seafloor is actually very sturdy.  This structure is made of
pink granite, the lowest level being the thickest part of the spiraled city.
Peering in either direction could prove to be a dizzying sight as it looks
that it may go on forever.  Then again, looking back out into the sea proves
to be even more complicated, unless of course, you should be a sea-elf.

Designed to support the many floors of the spiraling structure, it would
take an act of extreme proportions to make this structure falter.  A few
huge dark spots can be seen hovering about the surrounding dark water.  The
spots seem to resemble massive underwater mountains, though it's hard to
tell for certain.  One can only imagine what it is like to live under the
water, unless of course you are a sea-elf.

Appearances can be deceiving, in the fact that this large structure that
rises from the seafloor is actually very sturdy.  This structure is made of
pink granite, the lowest level being the thickest part of the spiraled city.
Peering in either direction could prove to be a dizzying sight as it looks
that it may go on forever.  Then again, looking back out into the sea proves
to be even more complicated, unless of course, you should be a sea-elf.

The lowest level of the spiral city appears to have many entrances.  A
number of glowing pumpkin-sized globes can be seen, attached at intervals to
the overhead stonework.  A closer examination of the walls show that the
pink granite is very thick; as it must be, to support such a huge structure.
Attempting to peer up to the top would only make one dizzy.

A large spiral stairway begins here.  Looking at the staircase, it seems
as though the stairway continues to the very top, however far that may be. 
The hustle and bustle of the market does not crowd the massive staircase. 
Accustomed to the traffic, the citizens keep their distance; allowing
unimpeded passage to those who need to journey to a different level.

Piles and piles of woven kelp baskets line the walkways.  Carts holding
all sorts of wares - from seashell necklaces to even the rarest of objects,
a wooden bow.  The loudness of the market is deafening.  Vendors shout their
latest finds or catches of the day, while only a few seem uninterested in
shouting, rather waiting for the right people to come to their spot.

The Fighting Stance is Urione's weapon shop.  Coral, steel, and leather
just to name a few of the materials of the weapons that are for sale.  Most
of the weapons for sale have been found or salvaged from ship wreaks. 
Xioxn, the weapon master, spends most of his time looking for a new find to
sell in his shop.

A smell of wet dead fish surrounds this vendor, since there is no cart. 
It is a first come first serve basis, meaning that the sea-elves pick out
the size and type of fish they want.  Baskets are piled high with many
different kinds of fish, for those who are unsure of what to get, Karina
offers her best catch of the day, all you have to do is simply ask her.

A large cart blocks the view of what is piled behind it.  Upon closer
examination of the cart, it appears to be a general store of sorts. 
Baskets, glowstones, water pouches, just to name a few, can be bought here. 
Though there may not be a lot of items for sale here, everything appears to
be something that is needed for life under the sea.

This lustrous marble path winds tightly around an enormous pillar of pink
granite the forms the central support of the city's outer shell.  The broad
sweeping of the ramp makes it easy to maneuver through the stairway.  Going
around, some levels are filled with air and contain what appears to be
houses and a few more small shops, while other floors are walled off by
panes of quartz, these obvious entries into the ocean.

begins on the guild level of the city.  Just above the market place, it is a
prime location for any guild to be, since to leave the city one will have to
go through the market place.  What a better way to pick up a few more items

This level appears to be a sea garden.  Trout and tuna surge from wall to
wall, while there are pens filled with crabs.  A few dolphins seem to be
harvesting, or taking care to this sea garden.  Going around, some levels
are filled with air and contain what appears to be houses and a few more
small shops, while other floors are walled off by panes of quartz, these
obvious entries into the ocean

A few sections of the wall seem to have been magically altered along this
stairway. Fish and dolphins can be seen swimming around the walls, and what
appears to be sea-elves cleaning just outside. The marble path is wound
tightly around an enormous pink granite pillar, the central support of the
city's outer shell. The spiral of the staircase has stayed the same, but it
is obvious that the very top of the city is near.

A few sea animals have been carved into the pillar here. A small squid,
a fish, even a mermaid are just a few of the many things that have been
carved. The details are very intricate and amazing to say the least. Just
a glance at them, one could tell that whoever took the time to carve these
creatures into the pillar, had a gift and love of art. The broad sweeping
of the ramp makes it easy to maneuver through the beautiful stairway. The

now, giving off a closed feeling.

{cA Sea Garden{x~
Dolphins swim through these passageways, though perhaps they are the
sea-elves in dolphin form.  There are what appears to be gardens of waving
sea plants, schools of trout and tuna that surge from wall to wall with
restless energy of the wild sea, and pens teeming with crabs.  It seems that
the dolphins tend to the sea garden, and the fish that live in here as well.

{cThe Sanctuary{x~
Here in the center of a large disk made of marble, there is a fresh water
fountain.  In all directions there are large rooms.  It's obvious this is a
private place for the city of Urione.  To the north lies the healers temple,
where anyone may go to heal.  To the east is the questmaster, a place where
anyone deemed worthy may enter for a task.  To the west is the trainer,
aiding all those who wish to become more wise, and to the south the
depository, where the sea-elves deposit their valuables.  Just below, in a
closed of section is the slave shop, where anyone in need of help, can buy
just the right type of slave for the job.

{CTemple of the Healer{x~
A large room off the center of the marble disk lays the healer.  The
priestess of Urione awaits anyone who might need to be healed of an aliment
or just need a refresh.  A kelp woven basket rests in the back of the room. 
Used as a donation pit, anyone may use what they want from it, as long as
they are worthy enough to do so.

{CWaiting Area of the Trainer{x~
A slightly smaller room than the healer and questmaster room, the
trainers room is adorned with many shelves off what appear to be books made
out of dried kelp.  The trainer will aid anyone who comes to him, mostly for
knowledge, he can help even the thickest of skulls become more intelligent,
but only as high as their brain will allow.

questmaster, only gives quests to those only deemed worthy of such praise. 
If a quest is desired the questmaster will give out a quest that one should
be able to complete.

grand.  Highly polished walls are built in with what appears to drawers. 
Only a single person mans this large place it appears.  He waits eagerly for
anyone to come in and either deposit or withdraw.

Stillness seems to have settled in this temple.  The air is filled with a
strong aroma of the sweet & sour incense that the sea-elves burn.  There is
no priestess in this temple, only an alter that appears to be a phoenix
engulfed in blue flames.  Upon looking up, the ceiling seems to stretch
forever, and small light orbs form the constellation of the blue phoenix.

quietness can make even the strong shiver.  The air in here is pungent with
strong smell of seawater and incense.  The only thing in this room is an
alter that bares a large dragon turtle, one of the might rulers of the sea. 
While taking the shear size of this temple, the gigantic ceiling seems to be
lit by stars, in which the constellation of the dragon turtle is shown.

A small room that doesn't appear to be used for anything, not even
storage.  The floors are well kept and there is a single mirror on the wall.
Though quite intriguing, this room has an uneasy feeling about it, and seems
to be kept clean and closed for a reason.  It might be best to just leave it
as is.

A chillness sweeps over anything that swims too far from the warmth of
the volcanic vents.  Though the vents give off heat, they also give off
toxic fumes that could be deadly if one is not adapted to them.  Crustaceans
and small fish swim eagerly around, picking off the dying and the young.  A
pack of barracuda swim overhead, eyeing the situation.

only sense of direction comes from seeing the city.  Many have suffocated
and/or drowned from simple indecision, as they tried to find their bearings
in the murky depths.

A chillness sweeps over anything that swims too far from the warmth of
the volcanic vents.  Though the vents give off heat, they also give off
toxic fumes that could be deadly if one is not adapted to them.  Crustaceans
and small fish swim eagerly around, picking off the dying and the young.  A
pack of barracuda swim overhead, eyeing the situation.

The water is slightly illuminated by the city of Urione.  Glowing globes
within the city give off a great deal of light, even from a distance.  The
only sense of direction comes from seeing the city.  Many have suffocated
and/or drowned from simple indecision, as they tried to find their bearings
in the murky depths.

A fish whips past, along with it a cool rush of water.  The floor of the
sea is very soft and comforting to those who miss the love of land.  Though
nothing can beat the warmth of the sun or the feel of fresh air, the sea
holds many wonders for those who dwell within its deepest fathoms.

An eerie silence seems to haunt the water.  Nothing is stirring, no fish
can be seen, and nothing in the sand seems to be moving.  All of a sudden a
dolphin whizzes past and many clicks and whistles can be heard.  Large
schools of fish congregate by the coral and anemones to have their feed.

The water is dark, yet unbelievably clear.  Large coral formations can be
seen all around, while small schools of fish swim in tight formations to
help ward off predators.  The sea floor is littered with large shells and
small sand dollars.  A few large sharks swim overhead awaiting the
opportunity to snag the next thing that will sate their hunger.
