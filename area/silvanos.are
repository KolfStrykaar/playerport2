A wooden dock juts out from the bank of the river, just where the river
splits.  A barge harnessed to a sea turtle lies in the water to ferry those
within the city back to the forest of Silvanesti.

Lorac St.~
You push your way through the crowded streets of Silvanost.  The hustle

decorated and designed buildings rise up from the ground just behind the
portable shops.  The people here aren't very diverse.  Almost everyone is
Silvanesti.  Probably due to the restricted access of the other population.

The vaulted ceiling just about doubles your height and is painted with
beautiful scenes of Silvanesti history.  You spot one section of the ceiling
that depicts the scene of Lorac attempting to master the dragon orb.  You see
another scene depicting the recent destruction of the forest and the efforts
of the elves to rebuild Silvanesti.  Accompanying the paintings on the
ceiling are the large colorful murals spanning around the inside walls of
the palace.  The true beauty of the palace is breathtaking.  Silver
chandeliers hang down giving light where there was once none.  An arch to
the north leads into the Palace Courtyard where sun streams down from the
sky above.  While to the south, an arch rises from the marble tiles, leading
back outside to the town.

of the palace.  The many colors create a whirlpool of an artistic
masterpiece.  Roses surround bushes that take on the appearance of a
multitude of animals and in the center there is a bush that looks like the
great leader, Silvanos.

You finally managed you push your way through the crowd and make it onto
a back road.  This street is much easier to maneuver on.  Small houses
for the Silvanost public lie along these back roads, as well as some bigger
houses for the richer elves.  You avoid the houses, knowing that the people
of Silvanost do not like outsiders.  Even if they are Silvanesti.

The weapons shop~
The shop's walls are covered with assorted weapons made from steel forged
by Silvanesti weaponsmiths.  The designs are very elegant, much like
everything else made by the Silvanesti.  They take great pride in whatever
they do.

The armor shop~
You walk up to the front counter and take a look at the objects on
display.  You see various shining steel breastplates, greaves, leg guards,
vambracers, bracers and other armor.  They all have the Silvanesti design to
them.  A few rusted pieces of armor rest up against the other side of the
counter.  Probably someone took these in for repairs.

The potion shop~
You walk up to the counter and look over the various potions beneath the
glass covering.  Various bottles of different shapes and sizes hold liquids
of different colors and consistencies.  Your curiosity tempts you to buy
each and every one of them, testing them all out.  But instead of being
foolish, you ask what each potion does.

The magic shop~
You walk up to the counter and see a young woman fussing with a small
gadget.  She notices you and then goes back to her work.  You notice she is
still watching you out of the corner of her eye.  Probably best not to try
and steal anything.  She is a mage, after all.  They are dangerous even when
inexperienced, possibly even more so.

The sweet aroma of cinnamon rolls and other Silvanesti delicacies drew
you into the bakery.  You realize that you are actually quite hungry, how
convenient for the baker.  You turn your attention to her ask her how much
each product costs.

The Speaker of the Stars' Meeting Room~
Moonlight brightens the areas of this room that the candles upon the
walls seem unable to.  The table that adorns the middle of the room is oddly
shaped, yet fully functional for its purpose.  The table is shaped like the
crescent moon, with a star connecting the meeting points of the moon.  A
chair has been set around the moon for each member of the Silveth, or high
council.  The star is set by 3 chairs, One for the Speaker of the Stars. 
The others are for upcoming heirs to throne.  Tapestries among the walls show
the stories of the past speakers.

This is the private room of Lorac, Speaker of the Stars.  The room is
splendidly decorated with paintings, sculptures and silver antiques.  A
four-post bed constructed from dark oak occupies the center of the room, its
lacy curtains drooping down just enough to obscure whoever (or whatever)
would be on the bed.  On the left side of the room is a large dresser.

The pathway leading down, is enshrouded in darkness so as not to draw
attention to itself.  The walls are incredibly smooth to touch, as if
polished by an unknown source.  The stairway continues to lead down, to
where a strange light can be seen at the end of the passage.

A strange light, originating from seemingly nowhere, illuminates this
dark catacomb.  The room is made entirely of crystal clear quartz.  Recesses
have been carved into the walls to serve as resting places for past
nobility.  In the center is a large glass tomb, with a plaque labeled across
it lid, reading, Silvanos.  The tomb is empty of its occupant, yet something
appears to have remained inside, underneath a ceremonial burial shroud.

The Temple of E'Li~
The landscaping here is extraordinary.  The center of the temple is
surrounded by large bushes that have been magically shaped in honor of the
Gods of Good, as well as those that represent nature.  Among these, stands a
peaceful looking elderly woman, blessing all who pass by.  Before her is a
pit of sorts that visitors have placed offerings in for those of need and to
pay homage to the Gods.  In the center of this temple room, stands a very
large statue of a platinum Dragon.

platinum~
This large statue is of a Dragon, but appears to be slightly different in
design, than what typical Dragons look like.  The statue is made out of pure
platinum, to represent the Father of Good, Paladine, as he would appear in
his Dragon form.  The statue has a slight glow to it, and one could almost
swear that the statue was peering down at them, smiling ever so elegantly.
The base of the statue is made from stone, and has some sort of writing
etched into it.  Upon close examination, it reads...
{x
{x             'My devoted children. Repent your sins, and I shall
{x             grant you divine favor. Speak thy words aloud, and I 
{x                              shall hear you'

{x             Father of Dragons, I repent and ask for forgiveness!

Sanctioned by the Wizards of High Sorcery, this guild is an outpost of
teaching for any and all who have been blessed by gods with talents of the
arcane arts.  Spell components and books line the bookshelves that seemingly
clutter the walls.  Fragrant smells of rose pedals intertwine with the
pungent odor of things best left unsaid.  Study tables are scattered about
more as much privacy as the small building will allow.

skills of thievery.  Mercenary and robbers alike can be found here drinking
