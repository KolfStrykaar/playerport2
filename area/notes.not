{DMistress Allyria,

 

The Blackguard is simply an otherwise defunct division of the Knights of the Lily,

elite warriors dedicated primarily to guarding high-ranking officials -- it

takes its name from another 'Blackguard' that was present in the Dragonarmies of old.

Aside from myself, and the guards within the stronghold at Xak Tsaroth, it is little else

than a pre-Roivas creation of myself during my tenure as Lord of Night, until the Night's Eye

Campaign had failed.

 

If you seek to allow it to remain, then such would be appreciated, although it is little

else than an outdated prestige I cling to, with my last official rank having been

Protector of the Lily. If Pilarth wishes to join, obviously he must first

climb through the ranks of the Lily.

To: Conclave

Born to an Elven mother, I was raised roughly. I aged a lot quicker than everyone else around me. This caused me to be a loner, and keep to myself. They Elven children were constantly teasing me, and even the Elven adults always reffered to me as "Him" "The Bastard." They never once said my name, except for my mother, who said it on the day I was born.


My mother came from a wealth Elven family, though, and paid for simple magic lessons. That is where i developed my avid love for The Art.


Growing tired of the way the others treated me-it just got worse, as I was far better than them in The Art- I decided to leave home. There nobody tried to stop me, my mother had died a year before.


Thinking back on my lessons, I remembered the Elves talking about The Wizard's Conclave. I thought that if I joined it, maybe I could show them I was more than a "Half-breed Bastard" and make something of myself. Even though Elves follow the Path of the White Robes, I won't. I will join the Red Robes in hope that they will help me advnace in The Art, and improve.

{dGreetings to all within the beloved ranks of the Holy Order of the stars. I apologize for my messiness, but recent things have made me unable to write with my normal hand. I am writing this missive to inform, and ask of some things. Just recently, in the Headquarters of the Solamnic Quadron, I, and Lord Sebastian Quickblade, helped break my brother's bond with the Darkness.

It would seem that we were succesful, but in doing so i sustained great injuries, and have lost alot of my memory of that day, and a few others surrounding it.

All that i can remember is the presence of a Lich, whom rejected me from the realms of Death, and brought new life unto me twice. My sacrifice for my brothers sake was not in vain, for with the help of the Quickblade, the Lich cast my brother, and a cleric named Shivask from his Legion of undeath.

I am not just writing to you to inform you of recent tidings. I am writing to ask that you all consider me as your own. I have spoken with Lord Sebastian, and we feel that it would be best that i serve under your Order. I can help bring those to the side of the God's of Light, and i can do many things for your Order. It will take some time to heal, but please allow me to do so within your Order, and as your own.

A small piece of bark is hanging from a tree in the courtyard. As you look closer there are a few words scribbled on it in poor handwriting, and many drawings. One of the drawings is of what appears to be an elven girl, above it is the name Bri'kania. Another drawing shows a unicorn. Another small drawing depicts the girl looking under a rock, with a small herb in her hand. Another drawing shows the girl holding a small two headed lizard. At the bottom of the bark are these few words.

The words are in poor common.

"{gMee good find things. I find things not many know about. Me bring them to Library, show to Library N. You put in fruitbook keep long time. Show younglings. They learn, Know what good.{X"

under the words are a small drawing of what appears to be an evil man Kagonesti elf. He has a large axe and horns protruding from his head. His eyes have X's marked in them, and an arrow is in his chest. Below the drawing is the name Ichijo.

What may not be known is who found it. IT was found by the

the only remaining Black rose knight. Who had a piece of the

shroud in his possesion. Since then said knight has been

intrusted to find the other two artifacts of the conclave.

A magical shield, and a set of bracers. He has been succesfull

once more in locating the shield.

 As you may know, the cataclysm could have been prevented by

the patron of the Black rose. But he let dark romures tain his

perspective, and insted of preventing the cataclysm, he commited

murder in its place. As the only remaining member of the Black rose

this is my fault. I shoulder the responsibility of atoning for

the sins. As such i will be going to retrieve the shield from its

resting place,  the fault line that caused the new sea to be born.

From my studies i have learned that the gods hide the shield here,

at the point where darkness took the upper hand in this world. And only

the darkness that did such can claim the shield. I am this darkness, so

i have agreed to claim the shield, and hand it over to the Mage known

as Yerthorn.

This is due to many great magical discoveries found within the our towers, I would like to invite most users of magic to apply to our ranks if they have not already done so.

This is due to many great magical discoveries found within the our towers, I would like to invite most users of magic to apply to our ranks if they have not already done so. If you are found and you are using magic, you will be asked kindly to join our us.

There are many in the world whom practice magic without cause or guidance, we seek to give both to the user. We have devoted our lives to magic, as many of you have. Within the conclave your dreams can be fulfilled. You shall learn things you would not be abel to learn anywhere else in the world.

As for those whom decline our invitation, not all will be considered renegades, there are those whom use magic that we have no say over. Such are clerics, druids, musical fools, and the Draconians. So do not fear for your life if you practice magic, this is not a missive for renegades.

Again, however, those of you whom are renegades, now is a chance to come forth, and proclaim your loyalties to the moons.

Now, if anyone happens to see someone using magic, please send word to myself, or Towermaster Rayo, for we would like to meet with said person. Again, any whom practice magic, step forward and do not be afraid, elf, half-elf, human, or whatever you are, save draconians, send word to the towers.

We are willing to meet with any whom claim to use magic, to gauge thier capablities.

I am not the leader, i know. And it is technically Cyrus and Luther, but i just had a nice little idea i wanted to pitch tot he clan. I figured it'd be pretty cool if the Mercs worked like a mob type o thing. Someone sends in money to a leader of the clan, and requests a hit.

The leader then takes that money, and offers it out to lower members, giving other mercs a chance to get some cake besides cyrus. This way, the leaders would kinda be like the middle man of it all. They get 35-50% of the steel, and the rest goes to whomever takes the job, and completes it.

This way some other players could get rich, etc. Just an idea. At least talk about it or something. I think it's something cool to consider.

{/{/{/

{DMy time within this clan has been brief, yet i still feel the inclination to send this missive. I have walked amongst these lands for many days and nights, scanning the lands of our enemies, learning, plotting.

I have spoken with others of this clan, those being Trellis, and Rhyton. We three have also spoken to a particular person whom wishes entrance into this guild. A lone assassin, sharing Rhyton and Trellis' ways of Sargonnas, has come to this order, and seeks admission. He goes by the name Chidak Crystalhawk.

We three feel that he is quite worthy, and capable of becoming one of this Order. We ask that you bring him into this Clan, and welcome him as any other of our Order.

{/{/

Another issue has been brought up amongst thist trio within the Brotherhood.

The city of Port o' Call has been takin from our Brotherhood. Cyrus Delrivian once was within our Brotherhood, until his betrayal rang across the clan as he announced his leave. When in his control, we were weak, and could not stand our own. But now the time rises to take back what was once more ours.

We must strike the city of Port O' Call, and take back what is rightfully ours. The time for passiveness is over, and aggression must be sought, or the Brotherhood will surely die out in time. I, The Dark Priest of H'Rar have devised a simple, yet time consuming, plan. I, Trellis, and Rhyton have went over this plan on numerous occasions.

And we see no problem within such plans, and are ready to set such things into motion. I shall await word from the remaining few of our Brotherhood, and i hope that some of you are ready, and willing to serve alongside your brethern as you should.

he was brought in by one for questioning, and led to the Captain of the guard, Hedrick.

 

Unknown to Pilarth, I followed, and upon Hedrick's persistant heckling of the squire, and

apparently encouragement from what may have been the Queen Herself, he struck out at him,

and with my assistance, the captain was vanquished. I have erased all evidence of the encounter,

believing it better for the Holy Guard to wander about without a leader, rather than immediately

replace him.

 

Furthermore, I have updated our intelligence on New Haven. The bridge to Qualinost has been

destroyed from the Qualinesti side, and all siege weapons are currently unsalvagable.

 

Unfortunately, we were unable to locate the Foresters' enclave, but pinpointed an accessable

entrance to the elven city of Qualinost, through the Qualinesti forests, near the entrance

to Wayreth forest. It was there that my worst fears concerning Darkenwood were confirmed.

Darkenwood no longer keeps its secrets back behind its bindings; it seems to spit out

Subject Leadership of the Mercs~
Text
Sargonnas



 I would like to formally apply for the leadership position.  I've had

time to RP with some of the members and already see that the clan has no

structure and set rp.  I've held leadership spots in other clans before,

once before in this clan infact.  I've also been a Leader of the Holy Order,

Black Order, and Knights of Takhisis.  Each time i've brought up the RP of

the clan, and made the members more active because of the RP.  I've had some

ideas on structuring the clan alittle bit, instead of every man for himself

and back stab everyone for the right price even if it brings in a couple

thousand more steel.  We need to have an honor system installed, with

structures.  I would also like to open a treasury department with your help

to kick up some rp, since the mud seems to be in a little bit of a lull of

characters with a lot of money i have some ideas on making some rp and just

need the help in paying the members.  With a clan like this i would imagine

woudl have a treasury and an armory and all that.  I think this clan could

be great again and would like the chance to make it so.  The current

policies are making this clan weak, there are no active rps that bring the

clan together.

Lord Rayo,

 

You have asked in your own missive for all necromancers and enchanters to contact you so that you may address them.  It is for this reason I leave this parchment where I am sure you will find it.  For one, I do not lump myself with the others of whom follow the ways of enchantment.  I am above the others in strength and intelligence and shall remain so.

 

If you wish a favor of me then you should ask me directly.  If you wish to give warnings of some sort then none are needed.  I will say that I doubt any necromancers of worth will meet with you, nor any enchanters of worth.  Perhaps you should simply call on myself or the necromancer Emenius for you questions.

 

The Moons shine upon you,

{D*A scroll is laid upon your desk, it is wrapped in a dark, black ribbon. After unraveling the ribbon and unrolling the scroll, it reads:*

{/{/{yI have made my way to the Port city. It seems that Port O' Call has not changed since my last trip here many years ago. After servailing the city, i found that there are the usual fifty one city guards, that most always appear in sets of two. I assume they do this so that there is always a group style of defense, to better defend against an attack. These city guards were once of our control, but the Whore's Children have claimed them, and turned them.

They do not have any patrol patterns, but instead are stationed periodically across the city's limits. They are stationed far enough from one another they cannot be seen, but still in earshot in case of an attack, an alarm may be sounded. I tested this theory with a quick attack of my own. It wasn't large, just enough to get their attention, and as i thought upon getting attacked, alarms were sounded and the whole city went on alert.

I have also noticed that the Queen's Army quite often uses the Port City's boat services to transport large amounts of provisions and weapons to and from the city. I assume that if we can cut out that source, then starvation itself will do alot of the work for us before an actual attack is needed. If done correctly, we could possibly cripple their army before ever raising a hand and spilling blood.

I will stick around the city a bit longer and see what else i may discover, but for the mean time this is my report. I have noticed than many of the high ranking Knights of the Queen's Army tend to travel to an Inn and Bar called the Last Call. I will station myself there, and see what information i may gather.

My other feats include securing lost copies of Abanisian Archeology by Flinders Pitrye, which I procured for a cartographer in Solanthus. My own research has been about the Makau, lost shaman of Ice Wall. This is in part due to my own ancestry.

{yThe time for action has come. The Queen's Army has let their defenses within the Port city slip. We must strike now while they are at their weakest. Most of the Knights stationed within the city lose themselves in their absinthe and ale. If we time it correctly, we could slip in and take back what is rightfully ours, without any form of resistance.

I have set back and watch many, MANY, of you do nothing within my time here, and it sickens me. Let us take action now, or not at all. The time for regaining what's ours has fallen upon us, Rise amongst those who wish to stand tall, or fall down to nothingness of the wretched.

Hey guys, I know a lot of you guys want to take back PoC, i've already

contacted Allyria to start the RP for it and am just waiting to hear back

from her.  Since they RP'd taking it away it is only fair to see if they

want to RP defending it before we take it away.  Just because they are

inactive doesn't mean that RPwise the Knights aren't there and we can walk

in and take it.  If i don't hear anything within a week I'll be sending

notes around so we can all contribute on the story of taking it back.  I'm

also working on an angle for New Port as well but that will depend on a

couple of other things, including players to log in and get back to me about

the RP.  

Sorry it isn't going as fast as we would all like but we need to coordinate with other clans when our rp affects them and that is more difficult then i would like. If nothing happens with other clans I've been talking to Sargonnas in bits and pieces about ways to start RP within the clan.

 

 

Thanks

Frank.

involving scouting missions against each other and then maybe a final battle

to determine the out come.  It could either be code based or rp battle.  I

prefer code based simply because everyone likes to be gods.  Let me know

Master Yerthorn,

 

It has come to my attention that the apprentice known as Pashintra is poorly lacking in matters and has been taught very little from whatever Teacher you have assigned to her.  Her flightly manner and lack ot tutelage reflects badly upon the Conclave and all others whom follow the tenets of the Cousins.

 

She has also stated that renegades have been hounding her every move, attempting to steal her away from the Cousins fold.  Has she not been instructed on how to deal with renegades?  If this is the case then her Teacher is a lout and she should be reassigned a new Teacher, NOW!

A Well Traveled Intersection

  You have come up to a wide intersection in the forest of Solace.  The

forest trees have grown especially wide apart in this area, but their

branches join into a tight mesh canopy overhead.  From the west, a cool

breeze lightly wafts through the area.  A deep resounding hoot emits from a

nested hollow high overhead.  The cleared trail breaks off in all

directions, continuing on to the north and south on the cleared path.  To

the west, it appears to open up to an even larger clearing, and to the east,

the trees grow closer to the road, making the trail appear to be more used

by an)mals, rather than people.

 

if you can see in the world animal its spelt incorrectly - there is a boar normally standing here, and this is solace.

I also think that some clans need an active Immortal to take care of them, so I think I could fill that gap.

Why do you think you will make a good Immortal:

As you should know and as I mentioned before spend lots of time online, and I have a decent knowledge of this game (I have been playing this game since 2002)

Thanks

hi Morgion, following is my submission. it didnt state WHo to send to so im sending it to you.

Regards, Michelle

 

Hi my name is michelle, better known on the mud as Pashintra the red robe.

I read the post regarding imm submissions for applications and would like to apply.

 

I'm 28yo female from sydney australia, finding myself usually on in a timeslot of little use to most players, spending a great deal of time with but a few people.

 one great benefit to my app being approved would be an imm able to respond to those in that time slot, and the chance to increase overall imm presence by being available in those graveyard times. we've had some european players recently, something ive enjoyed seeing and would like to encourage more people to join from other countries.

 

My background is varied as far as gaming goes, I've been a fan of the DL series most of my life, and have probably read almost all of the available books at least once. I began with the original six, and moved out to the various branches, now recently having added more to my collection. I've enjoyed each and every one of them for the passionate drama they bring and unfold. My fave is probably the twin books.

 

I would love very much to be able to be an RP type imm that adds value in roleplay, initiating and responding to action occuring, to encourage as much as possible more creativity. I also have a strong interest in actual area building also, I have been a creative writer for about 15 years,  and have written hundred of pages in my time in various short stories and tales, or participating in group rp's could be included in that.

that. I have a fondness for the gods of good, but am also enthralled by those who are not, or are in between.  

 

Whilst i have no real building experience, ive certainly been admin before on several games including Shadowmere, a strategy game. I've lead clans and groups over the years, and my own life experience in sales and management has led me to see things with a fair measure.

 

Why would i make a good imm? I'm approachable, I don't judge, i get pleasure out of helping and interacting with people, I am creative and wish to  help spark that inside anyone willing or wanting. 

 I do not care much for power of position, its a little boring to me being honest, what I enjoy is being able to help those around me find themselves at home and ease, feel their best in the game world.  To serve.

 

I realise that my own experience inside this mud is limited, but in time that will change

 

 

I am generally available for 1-2 hours a day, but at the moment that can expand onward to 5-6 hours at a time, as it has been most evenings.  I have 100 hours already on pashintra and she's only a few weeks old.  

 

If you care to see some of my writing style, you can view an old start to a tale at http://paladine.i8.com  it was written 2005, and i tried to expand the view of the writing to beyond just a player writing about themselves in actions.  Its a poor attempt that i can show, as others are not accessable like this but does show something of my passion to create.

 

I hope that this application is suitable, and that i may be measured for my want to bring more to the mud, not just gain a handle and sit back and hammer with a big stick. whats important to me is adding value to the mud.

 

my email is skase007@yahoo.com

thankyou so much in advance for taking the time to read this application

Regards, Michelle aka Pashintra

Greetings Followers of Good,

 

 

My name is Aiyre Whistler, a cleric of Mishakal. I come from afar

in the name of The Blue Lady to do good deeds, spread the word and assist

where needed. 

So far, in my travels, I have been alone on this persuit. And then

I had a strange vision, almost like a waking dream. In this

vision, in a beautiful marble courtyard Mishakal came to me,

and spoke these words, "Seek out the Holy Order and you will 

find those like you- pledge an oath to them, and you will

no longer be in this alone."

Upon awaking from this trance, I gathered my belongings and

made the journey to Solanthus. What a beautiful city!

Upon arrival to the Holy Order's Temple, I met many

priests, however none of them were obliged to tell me how I may

join, so I leave this note inside of the Cabinet in hopes

that one day soon it may be answered.

 

May Mishakal's healing light shine upon you,

Aiyre Whistler

Of late, the mercenary companies have been involved in countless

murders, assaults, thefts and all manner of aid to criminals, most of, no

doubt justifiable, but all of it lawless and harmfull to the people of

Palanthas, Solanthus and other members of the lists of loyalty.  My

question, is simply this...  Are your companies nothing more then a branch

of the thieves guild, or a company of disciplined soldiers?  If such actions

continue, I would ask you examine your goals and your reasons for basing

yourself in Solanthus.  Do you aspire to nothing more then creating mindless

pointless chaos?  If so, why call yourself soldiers?  I have myself been

subject to many attacks from your members recently, and for the life of me,

can see no motive, other then sheer mindless pointless pettyness.  Is this

how you would have the world view you, gentlemen?  I was raised to consider

the companies of Solanthus a disciplined band, well worth calling on in

need.  What I have seen of late makes the most juvenille, aimless childs

Duke Inglor,

 

In response to your missive, while you made some good points was entirely unprofessional. I understand your concern with the Guild members actions of late and i assure you the new leaders are working together to put this to an end. 

 

Yes we are paid soldiers, though there are some that are paid assassins and theives as well. I am trying to build a cohesive unit but that will be hard due to recent lapses of judgement in previous leaders. You have my personal word that the mercenaries will break no laws for the foreseeable future.

 

If we receive a contract within your borders i will personally send you a missive of our intent, mind you we will not break our contracts but i assure you we will do everything we can to abide by the law.

{rA man walks up to you and hands you a missive and quickly walks away, for once the man doesn't seem to care if he's been seen or not as he dissapears down an alley.{X

 

This Missive is for all Mercenaries.

 

There is to be an immediate stop to any law breaking in Solamnia. YOU will not attack anyone, steal anything, do anything illegal in their realm. If you recieve a contract for these lands you will bring proof of it to me and I will give you the ok to do said contract. If you, any of you, continue to do the contract without my approval you will be dealt with harshly.

 

We are coming upon a time where our past actions are coming to haunt us, and where we have made enemies. We need to do everything we can to avoid any kind of war, because we are not fighting for money here. We would be fighting for our very survival and for our right to continue in the trade we are in. If any fighting breaks out because of our actions that member will be stripped of everything he has and cast out into the streets a beggar.

 

You may ask yourself if this is harsh, and the answer is yes it is. As it must be with the members we have, and their abilities. We can no longer afford to be a group of ruffians that abide by no laws, and paying for nothing. The guilds coffers have run low and the collecters are coming around for their dues.

 

The Guildhall itself is in danger of being lost to us, it is in poor repair and the Solanthus City Tax Guild is ready to take it back. We no longer have holdings in other cities, we no longer have a safe haven anywhere else. This must stop, this is no longer a business but an outlaw guild. That must change, if you do not wish to be part of a fighting force please let me know and i will make sure that you are not.

 

In the city of Solanthus no Mercenary can attack another, though if you recieve contracts to attack a city that is being defended by another captian in the guild that is allowed. You WILL give quarter and take prisoners amongst your fellow mercenaries. You WILL NOT however slay them out of hand, our membership is far too low for such measures.

 

If there are any concerns you may leave them on my desk in the guildhall, but these rules stand. As I said things will change and you can either be a part of the future or a bump in the road of the past. I suggest you share the future with us, the cementaries are becoming full.

 

{rThe missive is unsigned but a mark of a gold coin in red ink is near the bottom of the page. This is the customary signature of General Ikarus Noskire.{X

 

OOC> Yes i'm still on vacation but i've been contacted that the guild needed some leadership. I know many of you see this guild as an excuse to pk and steal and get away with it. For the clan to grow that has to stop. The guilds are here for RP not an excuse to pk, because every PK has to be RP'd anyways. NO exceptions, especially if they are due to guild related issues. This goes for everyone including myself and Delacroix. We as leaders are no better then the rest of you.

Subject Rise of the Conclave~
Text
A parchment, found in an area specific to each person, is found.

The parchment has the seal of the Conclave on it, and of the Chaslor

line.  You open up the parchment and read.

 

{rI hope this parchment has found you well.

Soon, there will be a gathering of us in the Conclave.  When I

say 'us', I mean by those of higher prestige.  Ordermasters,

Archmagi, and the like.  It is time for us to gather together

and form a plan to bring our towers back to life.  Between lack

of communication, and lack of activity, we boarder the fate of

being silent forevermore.  We as Conclavians cannot allow this

to happen.

 

We must discuss, and come to a conclusion, of how the Ordermasters

must run things, the topic of a new Towermaster, and other topics

that might be on hand that would be useful to cover in this meet.

I wish to make these meets a regular thing, and they need not be

often, but at least once a month, so that we may all touch base with

eachother while setting and meeting goals.

 

The moons be with you.{x

 

Signed,

{rAerogos Chaslor, Lady of the Red Robes{x

Niro has been added to our ranks!  As our recruiters have been busy

currently, I personally tested Niro.  As he passed just fine, he should be

easy to spot IC as he has a medallion of faith and a robe of our clan.  If

any of your don't have these items, send me a note and we'll get you the

quick quest to catch you up to current induction policies.  You guys rock! 

As we work on keeping the identity of some of our members a secret, I've

asked that all parties have a medallion of faith and a robe of the black

order.  They can be your current items for your neck slots restrung to: a

medallion of {DFaith{x, the long should be depicting your specific

religions.  Also, our clan guardians carry a Robe of the Black Order. 

Please have one of these to wear when inside the clanhall.  If you wish to

be bold about it and have your current item restrung to a robe, you should

make sure the item you restring fits in the torso slot.

{G--{yA missive dropped before the Forester's Hall in Solace by a large Kodiak Bear{G--{x

 

{gYou must excuse the wording in this scroll if it is differant than it should be.  I am not used to speaking, let alone writing, in the tongue of the humans.  

My name is Lyselatria and I am born of the Kagonesti that live upon Ergoth.  I have only recently come from the island to the mainland.  I have been asked by my elders to search out those of like mindedness as myself.  In travelling through the town of Solace, on my way to the shrine of The Forest Mother,  I heard of the Foresters.

I wish to speak with a member of your Guild in the hopes of joining you in whatever direction you shall be going at this time.  Most of the time I may be found in the shrine of The Forest Mother, or in the surrounding forest.  If I am unable to be found then leave a message with the beasts and I shall find it.{x

The mage awoke with a start, her head throbbing and spinning. Slowly the briliant light all around her dimmed, allowing the world to come back into focus once more.  Pashintra tried to bring herself upright, finding the sensation of spinning unbearable the mage slumped down once more.

 

"Acolyte! Get help!" a voice echoed in her head, seemingly a thousand miles away.  Clerics rushed over and began to lift her gently, one noticing she clutched something in her hand, small and dark. Attempting to remove it from her hand, he reeled across the room as sparks flew off her, the clerics dropping her suddenly

 

 

"Evil!" the shocked one gasped "In the hands of a red robe!" Mutterings continued amongst them, until finally a voice boomed "Bring her inside! Doubt what you know and do not fear that you don't!"

 

Pashintra awoke hours later, finding herself in the comfort of a large and soft bed, the inviting glow of candles all around her, the fireplace endless in its crackle and low rumble.  

 

"I am glad to see you still with us child, though for a time it seemed you would not recover"

 

 

Pashintra turned towards the voice sitting beside the fireplace and sat up slowly "I would thank you, whoever you are for the aid, I am.."

The old cleric interrupted "We are well aware of who you are, elf.  One of your Order was informed that a mage was found on the steps of the temple. What you were doing at the entrance to Paladine's place of worship is a mystery to all." His old eyes shone brilliantly with life and love "Do you know what happened to you?"

Pashintra tried to remember anything she could, and slowly the words came

 

"I was ...with Aiyre!!! She was being hunted by darkness, and has been for weeks.... We travel often together you see, and it has become my place to ensure her safety against odds that would overwhelm her!!! But... I was struck down before I could aid her, luckily there were those around that heard our plea for help and came, The High warrior one of the first to assist..."

 

The cleric hushed Pashintra "Why don't you start at the beginning?"

The young elf let out a breath, puzzled as to where she should begin."For weeks now, myself and my travelling companion Aiyre, a cleric of  Mishakel, have been plagued by dark messages, and warnings.  By day we travel far as we possibly can, by night seeking refuge in the most isolated of places... Yet each night they come, whispering of doom and destruction. "

 

Pashintra groaned, adjusting herself to avoid her bruises touching anything but the softest parts of the matress .

"A few nights ago, we were set upon by a demon known as Lazurus, fortunately for us we were in good company, some Forester's named Lyselteria and Therin, who managed to help us escape its clutches... But this was just a sign of what was to come!  The demon attack came straight after a most odd experience, we were on the trail to Dargaard, when all of a sudden Aiyre realised her weapon had vanished, so we seperated looking for it"

 

The old man sat forward, never speaking, an intent look in his eyes

Oashintra groaned in pain, but kept going "I found myself in a dead end, and an old man approached me with a staff, saying that its rightful owner was looking for it. I knew when he gave it to me that its owner was Aiyre. The old man was... well he was Paladine"

 

"The platinum dragon sought a red robe out?" The cleric seemed most interested and perplexed

 

Pashintra nodded solemnly "The thought has kept me puzzled long into the night. But when I gave her the staff, it shone with a purity that brought tears to my eyes.  It was trully a gift from the gods."

 

The Qualinesti mage looked dark once more "Lazurus has been hunting with increasing ferocity since that moment, chasing us all the way to Palanthas, hunting and stalking our every step!"  Pashintra threw her hands up in the air "Right to the doors of Palanthas!"

 

The cleric sighed "This we know now, after the destruction they have caused around the city. it was fortunate that the High Warrior and High Clerist came to your rescue."

 

Pashintra agreed "Its has been my charge, to protect Aiyre, and I am failing. Thanks be to the gods that they were there! I was subdued, and found myself int he presence of my own mistress, Lunitari. She warned me about the path I have chosen, and i awoke to find myself... in this bed, clutching this idol piece."

 

Pashintra held up the head of a small figure to the light. It is simply carved, and well aged. She grimaced  "This is the third piece I have encountered. The other two I obtained through a ....bargain with a dragon.  He had slain the previous owner, and had to be convinced..."

 

The cleric looked shrewd for a moment "A bargain with a dragon?  The price?"

Pashintra shook her head "It is mine, and mine alone to know and pay. Needless to say the Blue dragon has a deal with me, and we both honour it."

 

The old one pointed a finger "Be warned, no dragon of darkness is to be trusted"

 

The mage nodded with a determined look "That is for me to worry about, kind one. The attacks in Palanthas included Dragons that would have levelled the city had they not been subdued, so I have obtained some defenses for our own protection,  Aiyre and I... "

 

The cleric looked sadly at Pashintra "You travel a dangerous road, Red Mage."

 

The Qualinesti mage nodded "I am aware, if anything else, of that fact." Pashintra continues  "There are two more pieces, and I have knowledge of their  whereabouts now, they rest with a holy Solamnic."

The cleric frowned "What are your plans? Do you know what these items do when brought together?"

 

Pashintra shrugged "I do not know, all I know is that we have little time or choice in the matter, the items must be gathered, and we must determine their powers and use, before its too late. There are those against us now, even as we speak, plotting to ensure this never happens."

 

"I cannot see the conservative Solamnics wanting you to complete this task you have set yourself. They will err to the side of caution." The old one held no cheer in his voice.

 

"I'm sure they will, but as with my own order, they will need to be reminded that sometimes things happen whether or not they like it." Pashintra sat up fully now, allowing the warm air to caress her face.

 

"Very well child, It seems none can stop you. May Paladine and Lunitari bless you! For now, you need rest, and rest you shall" The cleric shuffled out of his seat, and bid farewell.

 

Pashintra waited long moments until she could no longer hear the footsteps, and instantly jumped out of the bed, reciting a spell she vanished into the air.  There was no time for rest. The world was running out of time.

{DChildren of Mai-tat,

 

  I have returned from a long pilgrimage and 

am disappointed and utterly disgusted at what 

I see. I walk through the halls and find them 

nearly empty. I hear no clerics singing Her

praise nor do I hear knights training in the

courtyard. This fact saddens me deeply, but

sadness quickly turns to anger.

 

  I request a missive from Her followers so

that I may be reassured of your faith to the

vision. I have a book containing the members

of Her knighthood and if I will be forced to 

hunt down those that do not reaffirm their

allegiance to Her.

 

I await your responses.

This book is for all Forester's to pen their travels in.  I see so few of my bretheren that sometimes I wonder if I am the only one about.  I understand the need of our bretheren to be out in the forests of the world and that is why I write here.

 

My travels have taken me many places.  From the sanctity of Chislev's glades to the horrors upon Dargaard mountain.  I have fought dragons and undead and all sorts of other creatures hard to define.  Yet here I live.  Will it be my turn soon to lay down my life for the forests and glades that I hold dear?

Greetings to all those of your halls. I seek admission into your guild, so that I may meditate undisturbed within the peaceful settings you provide and tend to with the upmost care.  

I am but a simple follower of Nadir the Dreamsender and seek enlightenment through his wisdom. While some your ideals may not completely entwine hand in hand with mine, trust when I say that I shall not be a burden to you all. The land is but one piece in the puzzle we call life. The future will not arrive, without us first taking part in the present, and appreciating the past. 

Allow me entrance into your halls if you will, so that we may carry on together and embrace the wisdom and good will of this thing we call life.

It is with a deep happiness that I find your missive expressing interest in joining your forest bretheren within the Foresters Hall.  Of course you will be admitted.  If I noted anything through our travels together it is that you are trustworthy and care about the common causes we, as Foresters, thrive against.

 

I find myself in a position to allow you into the Foresters upon seeing you once again.  As always, the forest breeze, or the small birds and animals, will know how and where to find me.

We have sought out the word of gods, and histories.  The sign of Morgion, it approaches us, and we should all be aware of this.  Paladine himself graced me with his presence, giving me a holy weap

Knowing what I do now, it is a certain that many will judge me wrong. Aiyre and I have a task ahead of us that may darken the

Pashy and Aiyre, mainly pashy had a run in with the nightmaster the night earlier, who was dire and hinted that there was a vessel, a body they would use. (he was most gracious reading notes from you at same time as rping, i filled him in as much as i could realising that

 

anyway the pashy and aiyre finally found gulgor at solanthus paladine temple. others arrived and gulgor nearly didnt go ahead with the joining. the pieces [pashy had flew into the air, and a dark knight appeared and managed to knock the pieces out of gulgor's hand.

 

when that happened,the pieces joined in the air, and pashy screamed to aiyre to use her staff to touch them. when she did they burst into a millin shards, the temple began to quake and they bore into the stone floor, causing a huge crack to appear and a rift.

 

gulgor was furious at the damage, the tmple was nearly destroyed as columns and cieling collapsed

 

 

who

they managed to all survive. The temple is fairly ruined, and now they all await what comes forth....

 

thats the basic, but ill send you the log which is fairly interesting lol

mharik claims to be a serv of tak, and son of delrivian. he promised that all this morgion business was a distraction, that tak was the true threat. was very random....anyway have a read of the log, erm actually i better send it to an email address, its too big to post under notes

Greetings everyone, this note serves to explain the reason why I will not accept Dirge as a member of our clan.

I have heard many complains about his lack of roleplay and social skills, sometimes mixing ooc business with IC business, low level player harassment,(logging of a char and striking with another), RP disruption and so on In my opinion we don't need this kind of behavior neither in this clan and even less in this MUD.

Gulgor narrows his eyes and turns swiftly, going to the edge of the crack.  He sits down at

The sun broke over the city of solanthus, the streets already bustling with activity as 

bakers delivered goods to houses, merchants opened their stalls anticipating and hoping for 

a busy day ahead. The colours of autumn play in the heart of the city, with stalls painted 

in its colours, of red, oranges and greens.

Flags of the city dance in gentle breezes, and 

wafting aromas from the food vendors tantalise the three figures entering the city gates.

 

"I'm glad you took your humanoid form, Valakas" Aiyre pipes up cheerfully

"The sight of my true form would change the atmosphere, no doubt" Valakas intones.

 

Pashintra 

pondered what the city would have looked like if he had arrived in his real image, which was a very large and fearsome looking blue dragon.

The streets would be filled with people awash with dragonfear, and chaos would no doubt reign the day, something the trio sought to ensure did not happen.

 

Aiyre laughed at Valakas' words, which made Pashintra smile. She had not seen the cleric in such high spirits for many weeks, the addition of the dragon to their party turned out to be a boon both in defence and in morale.

The weeks had been hard on them, facing threats well beyond their capabilities, yet through luck or wit they had managed to survive.

The recent attacks in Palanthas had weighed heavily on Aiyre who felt responsible, her reasoning that the pair had brought the trouble with them into the city. Pashintra reasoned they had little choice, but it mattered little to the cleric of Mishakel.

All she saw was the ruin and bodies that had been left in the attacks wake, and its weight bore on her heart heavily.

 

who

Pashintra sighed thinking of those tense moments, when the High Clerist and High Warrior had slain the diseased dragon, Nightclaw on the steps of Paladine's temple, as those inside watched in awe and fear.

It had been a trully heroic rescue, and both were grateful for it.

 

In the days following, The mage had followed a trail of clues leading her to the final key to the puzzle - the two missing pieces of the idol figurine head she possessed. There were five in total.

She secreted away leaving Aiyre a note, and made her way to the Plains of dust, and thus had encountered Valakas, deep in his lair, an old ruined temple.  At nearly the cost of her life, Pashintra had succeeded in convincing the dragon of her need to obtain the arm and leg of this idol, now in his possession.

It seemed the previous holder had been foolish enough to enter the lair and try his luck at stealing from a dragon. A bargain was sealed, the price only Pashintra and Valakas knew, much to Aiyre's distress she would not find what the price had been.  

 

Since then the blue Dragon had accompanied them, an odd friendship developing between them, as time wore down defences and instincts.  At first Aiyre had been horrified and fearful, but she come to trust in the Elf's judgement, this red robe who never left her side, never led her astray.

Pashintra reasoned with Aiyre that Valakas upbringing and his temple lair, which happened to be an old temple to Paladine, had left him reason past all other blue dragons - that he sat much like she did, in the centre of balance.

Aiyre was hesitant, but as time proved, and battles, he was dependable like no other. The fact Pashintra now held three of the five pieces in her hand helped convince Aiyre as well. 

The location of the other two pieces location was well known to them now, and it was their destination.

Lady Allyria and my fellow bethern:

 

 A member of the undead, Xavier, along with thier leader, Dark Lord Dessan, approached me at dawn with important information. They have information that suggests the Mercenary clan are plotting to attack and reclaim the Port City for their own. He wishes a meeting with myself and Lady Allyria to discuss further.

 

 This may be why the attack upon our stronghold by the Mercenary clan took place. 

 

 I'll await word before further action.

My name is Arlanthis Breeze, for along time now I have traveled the lands singing tales of honor and glory at taverns to earn my bread.

But recently in my travels I have encountered an increasing sense of fear and unease in the people of the land.

I have decided that I can no longer just sing songs to inspire the poeple but I must lend my sword as well to protect the innocent and those who cannot protect themselves.

Therefore I would like to submit this application to the Holy Order of the Stars so that I may join the cause of good,and thrust my blade deep in the gut of those that would spread evil's seed.

Subject Sexual Advance Complaint~
Text
Majere, My purpose in writing to you is to bring awareness to you of an

important issue affecting two female players here, and to remind you of the

principles that a staff member should be able to recognize and effectively

respond to the sexual harassment of players.  As you know, I don't believe

this game allows sexual behavior towards mortals from an immortal. 

Longstanding imp authority (on many muds) establishes that harassment of

these players can be a very serious matter.  I want to commend the efforts

of Habbakuk in realizing the seriousness of the matter even though I

perceived the behavior as flirting.  This game has to ensure that all

players have a safe and secure roleplay environment that affords them equal

treatment.  Unfortunately, Nuitari has been accused of inappropriate

behavior towards Aiyre and Pashintra, which can interfere with how this

staff is seen.  Aiyre spoke to me in my room that she was feeling

uncomfortable towards another mortal.  She did not want to be straight

forward with me on the matter because, "he has a lot of strong characters." 

Now, both Aiyre and Pashintra are adults and understand that boys will be

boys, but they both insisted that this was a little more..  Over the edge. 

Nuitari asked for nude pictures from Aiyre and Pashintra.  When they did not

agree, Aiyre claims that he acted very immature and logged on Nayato and put

almost everyone on the wholist to sleep.  I am more concerned with

Pashintra's emotional well-being as she spoke to me about a past experience

of cyber bullying where she had her house broke into and was assaulted by an

online pervert.  Preventing and remedying sexual advances from the staff is

essential to ensuring a safe environment for our players.  Also, I received

an instant message from the player Ikarus regarding the matter.  As this

information has stayed with me and Habbakuk only, I believe Ikarus may have

been a witness.  I am enclosing this report with the notion that I do not

believe Nuitari to be a pervert, I feel that he was just acting like every

other 19 year old out there who is a mild nerd, but regardless if it was a

joke or not, it is unacceptable.  

 

Thank you for your attention to this matter of importance to maintaining 

a safe environment for all adventurers.

 

Morgion

Many times Arlanthis has given me his aid, and protection from the shadows that try

Subject Nightmaster Duties/Role~
Text
The Nightmaster of Morgion is the mortal end of Morgion's will, he or she

must be a priest of his faith, commonly held by humans and not much else,

they tap into the same essence of favor that the diviners do and then some. 


Command, usually giving the orders when a branch of the cult is too far away

from the dictator him or herself.  The dictator usually in the 'blessing' of

Morgion is deformed due to the sheer power granted to him or her.  Such

deformities would usually be made unnoticeable before the dictator goes into

public either by the illusionists, or by some other means.  The dictator

attempts to keep his rank out of the knowledge of any of the associates and

initiates of the cult.  Along with this, his subordinates are not allowed to

reveal to these ranks, who the current dictator is.  Such a thing could

prove hazardous.  Wherever the dictator goes he is usually accompanies by a

mage or fighter of at least the 'Silencer' rank, any less would be

ill-becoming of him or her.  The dictator tends to throw their weight around

at times to those who are of standard rank, putting them in their place when

needed.  The dictator also makes the decision of when a member shall be

banished, and if the member is banished, what their significant 'parting

gift' shall be, whether it be death, or a peaceful banish.  There is no

advancement beyond the Nightmaster and new nightmasters are rarely chosen,

unless the current one dies.  The Nightmaster never strays from the faith,

along with the favors Morgion grants his divine voice on Krynn, he also

makes it impossible for them to scheme away from his faith.  It is however

possible for the nightmaster to become a hit of an assassination, such a

case is however rare, as the cult attempts to make the dictator unknown to

those not of rank within the order, and as traitors are usually killed, the

information usually does not get around.

Per pre-authorization from Habbakuk himself, this is what we're looking to do

as far as requirements into the Solamnic Knighthood. These are loose guidelines

and any proper roleplay that is brought up from this - should you not meet the

requirements - is more than welcome and encouraged. However, libelous RP and RP

just to RP without a true purpose will be frowned upon. This is serious here

folks. The Knights of Solamnia are undergoing a complete restructure to try and

revitalize it and we would appreciate your help in bringing players into the

mud so that the staple of players on at any given time isn't an average of 3, 10

at night after class and work. Let's start rebuilding things and start up RP's

just for the sake of purposeful RP! As previously stated, I have obtained the

necessary preauthorization from Habbakuk himself to start using this rewrite of

the helpfile as a base guideline for induction and running the clan until Maj

or Hidd can approve it and replace the old helpfile in whole, or with just

pieces from this one. This is what we're after and being able to RP like a

legend isn't required, but you are required to RP. Plus, there's a whole bunch

of new stuff coming up for the Solamnics, so stay tuned!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Since the dawn of Vinas Solamnus, the Knights of Solamnia have upheld that which

is just and fair. They have defended the weak and protected the innocence. For

countless generations, Knights came only from the nobility of Solamnia. Names

such as Brightblade, Crownguard, and Tallbow. This was only reinforced during

the Age of Despair when the Knights were unjustly accused to be the cause of

the great Cataclysm. As time passed with the War of the Lance, the Knights stood

once more to uphold the Oath and the Measure. "Est Sularus oth Mithas."


REQUIREMENTS:

Those who so chose to join the SOLAMNIC order must meet the following:

 

RACE:

Traditionally, the Knights have allowed only those of true human blood to join

their ranks. However, after the War of the Lance, they began to allow Half-Elves

(though rarely) among their numbers. However, those who seek to serve and do

not fall within the realm of human, or half human, may join the Auxillary. As

the Knights of Solamnia have been known to honor exceptional individuals of 

other races with titles, such as in the case of the dwarven hero Kharas, short

of full admittance into the Knighthood.


CLASS:

While disciplined Knights, Warriors and Clerics work very well and closely,

the Knights of Solamnia have come to understand that they can be effective as

part of a diverse team. Whereas Knights, Warriors and Clerics are the only

classes currently accepted into the Knighthood, other classes may apply to join

the Auxillary. And as such, the Knights have found a great camaraderie with

other fighters and casters of nonevil alignments. During the Age of Might and

the early part of the Age of Despair (before the War of the Lance), the Knights

never trusted mages. However, after the War of the Lance, it was not uncommon

to find a White Robed Wizard working very closely with a Knight. Most of the 

other spellcasting classes are generally avoided due to their sometimes lack of 

good moral alignment.


ALIGNMENT:

While the knighthood reveres all gods of Good, all squires and Knights are

expected to remain devoted to one of the three patron gods of the Knighthood:

Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, or Habbakuk. And therefore - by extension - excepted to

always be lawful good.


SEX:

Before the War of the Lance, only those of noble birth, and first born son were

accepted into the Knighthood. However, with the passing of time and the War of

the Lance ending, it has been seen here and there to have a female Knight, even

one as exalted as a High Justice or Rose Knight. Therefore, both sexes are now

accepted into the Knighthood.


Those wishing to join may send a note to SOLAMNIC, or contact a Lord Knight to

arrange an interview. And don't forget to ask about the Auxillary if you're

interested!

(OOC) This is for "pretitles" for the Knights of Solamnia and the Auxillary.


.-.------------------------------------------------------------------------.-.

((o))                                                                          )

 \U/_______          _____ ____________  ____________ _  _____ ________   ____/

  |                                                                          |

  |  I sit here now to write and advise on the political structure for the   |

  |  rank structure within the Knights of Solamnia.                          |

  |                                                                          |

  |  The rank of SIR shall be issued to any regular Knight of Solamnia in    |

  |  good standing with the Knights of Solamnia. The rank of CAVALIER shall  |

  |  be issued to any Knight of Solamnia in good standing with the Knighthood|

  |  holding the rank of Sergeant. The rank of BARON shall be issued to any  |

  |  Knight holding the rank of Steward or higher in good standing, or to any|

  |  member of the Auxillary in good standing. The rank of VISCOUNT shall be |

  |  issued to any Knight with the rank of Captain or higher in good standing|

  |  or to any Auxillary member in good standing with the Knighthood. The    |

  |  rank of COUNT shall be issued to any Knight with the rank of Warden or  |

  |  higher in good standing, or any Auxillary member in good standing. The  |

  |  rank of MARQUIS shall be issued to any Knight with the rank of Marshal  |

  |  or higher in good standing, or any Auxillary member in good standing.   |

  |  The rank of DUKE shall be issued to any Knight with the rank of Lord or |

  |  higher in good standing, or to any Auxillary member in good standing.   |

  |                                                                          |

  |  For a closer understanding, let it be known that a Knight surrenders all|

  |  lands associated with his title to the Knighthood. However, that Knight |

  |  does not surrender his or her title to the Knighthood as it is a title  | 

  |  of prestige, honor, and nobility. For those within the Auxillary, they  |

  |  do not surrender their lands to the Knighthood as they are a reserve    | 

  |  detachment of the Knighthood called upon in times of great stress. There|

  |  is a single exception. The Knights of Solamnia still hold their         |

  |  ancestral castles without being forced to surrender them. From this, the|

  |  structure of the Auxillary follows:                                     |

  |                                                                          |

  |  Baron/Baroness hold and lead:                                           |

  |    1) Four to ten townships                                              |

  |    2) An ancestral Castle                                                |

  |    3) and may call upon a Company of one hundred and sixty men-at-arms   |

  |  Viscounts hold and lead:                                                |

  |    1) One county (twenty townships)                                      |

  |    2) An ancestral Castle                                                |

  |    3) and may call upon two Companies of three hundred and twenty men-at-|

  |       arms, and any Barons within their County                           |

  |  Count/Countess hold and lead:                                           |

  |    1) Two counties                                                       |

  |    2) An ancestral Castle                                                |

  |    3) and may call upon a battallion of one thousand, one hundred and    |

  |       twenty men-at-arms, and any subordinate thereof within his or her  |

  |       counties                                                           |

  |  Marquis hold and lead:                                                  |

  |    1) Four counties                                                      |

  |    2) Two ancestral Castles                                              |

  |    3) and may call upon two battallions of two thousand, two hundred and |

  |       forty men-at-arms and any subordinate thereof within his or her    |

  |       counties                                                           |

  |  Duke/Dutchess hold and lead:                                            |

  |    1) Eight counties                                                     |

  |    2) Four ancestral Castles                                             |

  |    3) and may call upon four battallions of four thousand, four hundred  |

  |       and eighty men-at-arms, and any subordinate thereof within his or  |

  |       her county.

  |    It has come to my saddened attention that many have forgotten the true|

  | chain of command within the Knighthood. And for that measure, I pen these|

  | galant words in an effort to remind everyone how the chain works proper. |

  | We should all know that any Knight within the Sword will outrank a Knight|

  | of the Crown. By that note, a Knight of the Rose will outrank a Knight of|

  | the Sword AND a Knight of the Crown. However, the circumstances bearing  |

  | mention are that the High Warrior, High Clerist and High Justice answer  |

  | only to the Grand Master and that no one but the Grand Master out ranks  |

  | the High Knights.                                                        |

  |                                                                          |

  |  - Heartlund, which is to include the city of Solanthus and the roads to |

begin pursuant to the appropriate evidence being provided. Also know that in the

event that a false report is filed and we find out about it, you will be charged

yourself with whatever charge was levied against the one you accused. Unfortu-

nately, that's the best we can offer right now as there is no charge for filing

a false report, but perhaps in the future. ROLEPLAY is encouraged and acceptable

with any Solamnic you find. Also, let it be known that the Solamnics will NOT

use the who list as a means to find someone and charge them. The Solamnic MUST

see that person IN CHARACTER, and THEN charge them. Any Solamnic caught using

the who list as a means to charge someone will be dealt with per the same

charge, and an internal Solamnic trial will commence unto the honor and integr-

ity thereof of the offending Knight! Lets get some RP back in swing!)

who

Hi guys and gal! Firstly let me thankyou for all being a part of the rp that unfolded at the solanthus temple. If you revisit the temple now you will find the DESC has changed im told! to reflect our rp somewhat!!! how cool is THAT!

I want to thank you guys for making it all possible. Everyone did briliantly especially those who had NO idea what was happening.  

The log has taken me well over 30 hours to convert into a creative writing piece. Its not perfect, but it will have to do. I've spend hours every day working on it, and have taken great artistic license with it.  I hope that everybody is happy with the representation they receieve. I tried my best to flesh it out, and give everyone a moment in the sun, give honour to your fine characters.

who

If anyone is offended by the way ive written - im sorry. It was a challenge to convert a present tense bunch of freestyle lines into a past tense story format.

i hope that you are all pleased with how ive represented you. It was an honour to rp with you all.

I have forwarded it to morgion, to give you an idea of its size -- in microsoft word it was about 8200 words, and 15 pages.

I proofread a thesis last year that was 15,000 words.

I did not approach each and every one of you , gulgor you are a hard man to catch, but tried my best to get as much info and creative direction from each player in regards to their characters. Mirinya - i hope you like your parts. Gulgor i left most of you intact, and added a little. Xyra, I fleshed your aid out, and hope you like it. 

who

Dredge - I tried to add as much purpose as i could, hope you enjoy your representation.

 

Once again thanks - anyone who would like it in Word format send me your email address. Otherwise it will show up under morgion's rp thread in the forums shortly i hope.

Sincerely

A BLACKORDER TOME

 

The Holy Orders of the Stars are the faiths that worship the 21 true gods of 

Krynn -- by whatever names they know them. Just as the pantheon consists of 

three celestial families, so too, the gods' worshipers fall into three holy 

orders. Priests of a Good god belong to the Order of Light, those of an Evil god 

belong to the Order of Dark, and those of a Neutral god belong to the Order of 

Balance. 

 

Relations between the Factions: 

Although the Orders of High Sorcery work together for the cause of magic, the 

three Holy Orders have far more hostile relations. To priests, ethos means 

everything, so to work with the other orders is to deny one's only purpose in 

life. If any alliance occurs between the orders, it exists because each thinks 

it can advance its own cause. 

 

(On the Legends of Krynn, we have divided the dark and light orders into the 

Holyorder and the Blackorder. There is no current faction for the priests of 

Balance.)


Monks and Priests of the Blackorder seek to dominate others, both those within 

their order and those without. Members have no interest in persons whom they 

cannot dominate or exploit. And anyone who poses a threat to a member should 

watch his back. Because they are unrestrained by ethics, members of the 

Blackorder would as soon slit a man's throat as smell a rose if they had 

anything to gain from it. But these men/women are evil, not stupid. They do not 

go around destroying everything they see. Such actions lead to vigilantism and 

lynching. On the other hand, cunning schemes lead to power, riches, and the 

admiration of the gods of Evil.

 

The Blackorder is led by the Nightmaster, who is assisted by one Shadowcaster. 

*Be it known though that if the Nightmaster of the Blackorder makes a decree, 

blatant and intentional breaking of that decree may result in being ousted from 

the clan and branded a Heathen.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Heathens:

Are evil priests and monks who refuse to acknowledge and worship an established 

evil god/goddess of Krynn, or when a Blackorder member defies the wishes of 

their faith or ignore set decrees made by the Nightmaster. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

 

There is a set list of common duties and possessions a monk or priest of our

order wears, weilds, carries, etc, and I'll be getting them out to you guys

shortly. My hope in this is to better help mold your character here in the 

blackorder and give you a good understanding of our inner workings so that

your character may flourish for the glory of the dark gods. These are

guidelines, not rules, and keep in mind to just have fun!

Hirinthas: Althea and her Immortal "friends"

Mon Mar 29 12:29:09 2010

To: Immortal

Today, I was speaking to Althea, whom has decided it best to inform me

that she used to play as Lunitari here.  She informed me of these matters

AFTER I offered advice to her regarding Nuitari's scandalous foray's into

asking for nude pictures of female players here.  She also informed me that

even though she is no longer on the staff here, she still has immortal

friends here and that I need to watch what I say and to whom I say it to. 

Certainly such cannot be tolerated, not even from a player.  I felt

threatened by her comments and informed her of such.  I also informed her

that I would be filing a complaint against her so that it was made clear to

the Immortal staff that there is a player here whom is willing to abuse her

Immortal friends powers to dish out punishments to people.  I have prepared

a log of the events and conversation that took place while I was questing

and chatting with Aiyre today and anyone is welcome to have a copy of the

log I have prepared which details, in full, all of what I said and all of

what she has said.  But, as I stated, I wanted it on file that I am filing a

formal complaint against her for her subtle threats, which I did not

appreciate.

Hirinthas: A Change of Mind

Mon Mar 29 12:54:58 2010

To: Immortal

I have decided to send my log of the conversation to the staff so that

all are aware of what was said because I am not afraid of what I said.  In

the event that I am marked as the mud snitch and my Immortal application is

denied because of that instead of denied on whether or not I am able to

properly perform the job, then so be it.  I would only hope that such events

would not happen.  I begin my log after this line ends.  

 

You tell Althea 'I see you here once more. Is it your intention to return as a high level wizard to help properly stabalize the chaos that has become the Conclave? Or would you be more inclined for the mass PK like so many of the others in the Donator's Club?'


Althea tells you 'i plan to roleplay and enjoy my time'

 

You tell Althea 'That, I do believe madam, is what they have all said and it has been proven to be incorrect every single time. I hope that you hold true to your word. The Conclave is huge disarray and regardless of my knowledge regarding the Conclave, it seems that Darkahn Kiralv's tyrannical reign will forever be imbedded into the Conclave because there isn't anyone willing to stand against what he has made the Conclave to be in it's present state.'

 

You tell Althea 'Though, if you seek to obtain a true mark from Lunitari, you are, sadly, out of luck. From what I hear from some of the other Conclavians, she was fired for massively abusing her power and that she is not a very nice person. And Nuitari does not seem to be any better. In fact, I believe he is the worst Immortal on the staff.'

 

Althea tells you 'Lunitari cared a great deal about the mud and left because she got married. she was not fired'

 

You tell Althea 'I would not know, to be one hundred percent honest with you. Though, many people have claimed she was very..."bitchy" and far too strict for anyone to have fun. But like I said, I am not one hundred percent sure. I have never met her. I just relay the dialogues I have had with other players. I ask your pardon if I have offended you because of a close personal relationship you have with that former player.'

 

You tell Althea 'As a word of caution to what will, hopefully, become a new roleplaying friend, I would steer clear of Nuitari. He enjoys asking female characters and players for nude pictures over the internet.'

 

You tell Althea 'Have you ever played in the Conclave before?'

 

Althea tells you 'I have. For the record, when I was Lunitari I was strict because players did all they could to break the rules. 14-18 year olds who liked to see what they could do to wreak havoc on the mud. So I followed the rules and yes it was harsh sometimes but I was never fired. I left the mud because I getting married and real life was taking over too much. So, for future reference I might be careful on what you say and who you say it too. I am not an immortal now but many of them are my friends.'

 

You tell Althea 'Are you threatening me?'

 

Althea tells you 'Not at all. I was merely stating that you should not judge a book by its cover when you dont know what it is about.'

 

You tell Althea 'I take poorly to threats. So, I shall say that if you ever threaten me again, I will file a complaint against you just like I'm going to file currently so that the staff are well aware that you're using your Immortal "friends" as a connection to handle punishments to people.'

 

You tell Althea 'I can certainly assure you that I read far faster, and much more than you do.'

 

Althea tells you 'If that is your wish you may do so, yet by no means did I threaten you sir. Your taking it as you wish. I have already informed the staff of your interesting views on them and I will send Majere a copy of this conversation in full'

 

You tell Althea 'Rest assured, the Implementors will know of your Immortal "friends" comment. And I'm sure they will take the appropriate actions necessary. I congratulate you on your success for your personal love life. And your success in your personal life. But do not, for one moment, ever mistake me for someone who will sit idly by and feel threatened by your words and think that it is ok. Because as it is, I form no judgements or opinions of other people until I have met them. Currently, I can unders

 

You tell Althea 'some of the things I have been told regarding your actions as an Immortal, others, I leave to future judgements.'

Shift + [ + a letter. The letters determine the color. r = red, b = blue... capital letters create brighter colors.

now, to stop making that color, you use "Shift + [ + x". That way, the colors don't bleed where you don't want them.

  | Knights of Solamnia control so that all may know where the Solamnic      |

  |  - Palanthas, the city of and all roads leading to the east and west.    |

  |  - Southlund, to include the roads between Vingaard Keep and Solanthus,  |

  |     and the plains just to the north of Vingaard Keep.                   |

  |  - Heartlund, which is to include the city of Solanthus and the roads to |

  |     the west leading to Port o' Call, but not Port o' Call as a city.    |

  | From hence, let it be known that any and all caught breaking the law will|

  | be punished and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Should you  |

advise anyone and everyone whom is attacked within one of these places to seek

out a Solamnic and file an appropriate report and be patient in understanding

that the Solamnics will mount an investigation and in the event we find - ICLY -

the person responsible, they will be charged and the apprehension hunt will

begin pursuant to the appropriate evidence being provided. Also know that in the

event that a false report is filed and we find out about it, you will be charged

yourself with whatever charge was levied against the one you accused. Unfortu-

nately, that's the best we can offer right now as there is no charge for filing

a false report, but perhaps in the future. ROLEPLAY is encouraged and acceptable

with any Solamnic you find. Also, let it be known that the Solamnics will NOT

use the who list as a means to find someone and charge them. The Solamnic MUST

see that person IN CHARACTER, and THEN charge them. Any Solamnic caught using

the who list as a means to charge someone will be dealt with per the same

charge, and an internal Solamnic trial will commence unto the honor and integr-

ity thereof of the offending Knight! Lets get some RP back in swing!)

To: all

Per pre-authorization from Habbakuk himself, this is what we're looking to do

as far as requirements into the Solamnic Knighthood. These are loose guidelines

and any proper roleplay that is brought up from this - should you not meet the

requirements - is more than welcome and encouraged. However, libelous RP and RP

just to RP without a true purpose will be frowned upon. This is serious here

folks. The Knights of Solamnia are undergoing a complete restructure to try and

revitalize it and we would appreciate your help in bringing players into the

mud so that the staple of players on at any given time isn't an average of 3, 10

at night after class and work. Let's start rebuilding things and start up RP's

just for the sake of purposeful RP! As previously stated, I have obtained the

necessary preauthorization from Habbakuk himself to start using this rewrite of

the helpfile as a base guideline for induction and running the clan until Maj

or Hidd can approve it and replace the old helpfile in whole, or with just

pieces from this one. This is what we're after and being able to RP like a

legend isn't required, but you are required to RP. Plus, there's a whole bunch

of new stuff coming up for the Solamnics, so stay tuned!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Since the dawn of Vinas Solamnus, the Knights of Solamnia have upheld that which

is just and fair. They have defended the weak and protected the innocence. For

countless generations, Knights came only from the nobility of Solamnia. Names

such as Brightblade, Crownguard, and Tallbow. This was only reinforced during

the Age of Despair when the Knights were unjustly accused to be the cause of

the great Cataclysm. As time passed with the War of the Lance, the Knights stood

once more to uphold the Oath and the Measure. "Est Sularus oth Mithas."


REQUIREMENTS:

Those who so chose to join the SOLAMNIC order must meet the following:

 

RACE:

Traditionally, the Knights have allowed only those of true human blood to join

their ranks. However, after the War of the Lance, they began to allow Half-Elves

(though rarely) among their numbers. However, those who seek to serve and do

not fall within the realm of human, or half human, may join the Auxillary. As

the Knights of Solamnia have been known to honor exceptional individuals of 

other races with titles, such as in the case of the dwarven hero Kharas, short

of full admittance into the Knighthood.


CLASS:

While disciplined Knights, Warriors and Clerics work very well and closely,

the Knights of Solamnia have come to understand that they can be effective as

part of a diverse team. Whereas Knights, Warriors and Clerics are the only

classes currently accepted into the Knighthood, other classes may apply to join

the Auxillary. And as such, the Knights have found a great camaraderie with

other fighters and casters of nonevil alignments. During the Age of Might and

the early part of the Age of Despair (before the War of the Lance), the Knights

never trusted mages. However, after the War of the Lance, it was not uncommon

to find a White Robed Wizard working very closely with a Knight. Most of the 

other spellcasting classes are generally avoided due to their sometimes lack of 

good moral alignment.


ALIGNMENT:

While the knighthood reveres all gods of Good, all squires and Knights are

expected to remain devoted to one of the three patron gods of the Knighthood:

Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, or Habbakuk. And therefore - by extension - excepted to

always be lawful good.


SEX:

Before the War of the Lance, only those of noble birth, and first born son were

accepted into the Knighthood. However, with the passing of time and the War of

the Lance ending, it has been seen here and there to have a female Knight, even

one as exalted as a High Justice or Rose Knight. Therefore, both sexes are now

accepted into the Knighthood.


Those wishing to join may send a note to SOLAMNIC, or contact a Lord Knight to

arrange an interview. And don't forget to ask about the Auxillary if you're

interested!

Subject An important note about blind players.~
Text
Hi, having spent many an hour on a variety of muds, both as a player and staff, I have a few ideas which would both benefit Krynn and the blind players.

As a blind player myself, text spam with speech software is a huge problem and usually makes blind players not want to get into groups of more than two or three.

This will hinder roleplay and now that there is a big following for MMR games, blind players are a text mud's best friend.

To that end, a few suggestions, one of which I already passed on to Chislev are listed below:

1. A command 'nearby' would allow blind players to get directions to places in Krynn, since the maps rely on sight. This would take the form of a list, such as:

-- Dart is a short walk to the north west.

-- Solanthus is a fair walk to the south.

-- Port O Call is a very long walk to the south west.

2. Punctuation is a very useful thing for screen readers, without which a reader will read multiple lines in a list as a single sentence and will make less and less sense.

3. Combat is very hard, spam from spell casters, missed hits and the like all take time to listen to, bearing in mind that a person with a reader must listen to everything, did I flee or am I still listening to a round of combat which has passed? If there was a 'third person' gag option, similar to brief, it could hide the text from other people's spells, hits and also misses by the mob and the person who needs the gag.

4. Tabled information is very hard to read, reading from left to right with no punctuation to pause a screen reader makes it difficult to check ones score without using the control and arrow keys to hear each section of the information correctly. Either a simple '.' after each item, for example Str 18 / 25. Con 20 / 34. Or format it as a list, each item on a new line.

There are doubtless other things that could be done to make things a little easier, and I have identified a number of game skills which could enrich some of the classes, for example other professions could include baker and brewer to offer better foods than can be purchased.

I'm more than happy to get stuck in and help with idea throwing if you ever need it.

Warm regards,

Richard, player of Jinnean.

{yGreetings Grandmaster Sebastian Quickblade,

 

I write this missive to you of something i deem imortant. I made travel from the city of Solanthus, where my guild hall resides, as i'm sure your aware of, and made way to the city of palanthas.

As i was within this city, that of which you find it necessary to keep your Solamnic branches headquarters, i ran into the past Duke Inglor. As i'm sure you're aware of, he is now a Holy Templar of the Holy Order of the Stars. That is not something that bothers me. But what strikes me odd is such skills he uses, as such Holy stature he claims, and holds.

Inglor, as I and Chidak Crystalhawk both witnessed, used a skill involving dark magic. He used said magic to course the aura of evil through his blade. I know of this skill, for I am of the darkness, and Chidak has used said magicks around me numerous times within our travels.

 

My question to you is: Why would a Holy Templar, past High Warrior of Solamnia, be using a skill and magic of the Dark Queen?

I write you this missive, in warning, It may be harmful to you, and others, if you place trust amongst him. I do hope this is helpful, and provokes a solution from you and the High Clerist. If any aid is required, a small fee and i am yours.

Greetings to you Zivilyn. I don't know your IRL name, so i'll just stick with Zivilyn. I've decided to write this little note to you, for a simple little request. I'm not sure if you know or not, but i am the player of Delacroix as well, and i had a character named kaenthis delgoth a while back. You allowed me to be leader on kaenthis for quite some time, and in doing so i revived the clan, and had alot of rp with it. When i deleted and left, the entire clan died again, the rp depended on me for so

**some reason. The purpose of this note, is to ask that you allow me to once again have a leader position amongst your clan, seeing as how i know what it is that is needed, and can definantly have roleplay sparked up in a matter of hours. Gael Carrick, a close IRL friend of mine is the current leader, but in roleplay he is only leader of the Administrative division. I would like to request that you allow me to be a co-leader, and of the collective division of the Aesthetics.

I want to get roleplay sparked up again for the aesthetics, as i once did before, and i also want to help my friend Gael, because he's fairly new to rp, and needs a little bit of help. So, please grant me this small request, and lets get your clan back in action.

To: Hiddukel Majere

This note is informal, and an inquery at best.  It has been some time

since I was a regular on LoK, and I've long lost track of the number of

hours I spent here.  Now it seems I have more time to myself, and the

playerbase (the reason I originally deleted my character Quinlin Olorien, a

brash move in response to what I felt was an overwhelming number of immature

players) seems to have calmed down.  My question is: is it possible to

restore that character?  I haven't even a clue if there's a limit on how

long a character has been deleted before it can be revived, but if it is at

all possible, I would be more than grateful.  If there are any stipulations

that would accompany it (name change, loss of hero status, etc.)  I would be

victim to the arcane powers that he was trying to master.  In his body now

resides a heinous being, a lich lord.  We must make it all of our duties to

attempt to save his soul.  I have communed with the Mother of the Forest and

have found out a way to protect his spirit while the lich lord inhabits his

body.  I will be searching Ansalon for a Soul Gem that will be able to

harbor his soul until we can oust the lich lord from his earthly form. 

After I am able to capture his soul we shall attempt to bring him back from

Aeleth's doorstep.  I miss his friendship and his wise guidance in matters

Zivilyn preserve us! Dredge's spirit was strong-- I pray we can wrestle it from the grasp of whatever fiend posesses him. By the time this letter reaches you, I will be (most unfortunately) deep in the desert. I have been dealing with other troubles-- namely, a dragon has made it's vile nest among my people and terrorizes them daily. They call him "Valakas". It pains me to be indisposed while our brother's very soul is in danger. What action do you propose?

I write this letter by candlelight, the sun having set hours ago... I am alone in the east wing of the library. It must be shortly after midnight.


I've noticed a strange occurance in this part of the library, which happens only after nightfall, when the silence is at its absolute. This is why I have come here, and why I sit documenting tonight's events as quietly as possible.


There is a far off echo, the sound of a gently creaking door, and the candle flickers at my side. This is but the overture of a strange nightly sonata. The books... begin to whisper. I know I am not mad, though I thought I was at first. From their dark perches in the shadowy shelves, they whisper to one another in a tongue I do not comprehend. And then... the scurrying.


From beneath the stone floor, there come dull scratching sounds... at first I mistook it for rats, but the noise is too deliberate... too chilling. I ran a finger across the floor, comparing the two... I suspect the scratching is that of finger nails. 


Either I am mad, dear brothers, or our beloved east wing of the library is haunted. Either way, my mind is too addled to linger here any longer, and I am returning, with ragged nerves, to bed.

Tue Feb 16 07:42:41 2010

To: conclave

It came to attention, at an early age, that I contained within clear potential to dabble in the mystic art of conjuration

My early years were spent entrapped in countless hours of study,

and soon found myself able to conjure the most simple of items and creatures.

Dedicated to pursuit of excellence, I often overlooked

other cultural studies of my own people, the qualinesti, much to the disgust of those around me.

It mattered little to me, their opinion..  My fascination of magic long overwhelmed any need for company with my bretheren,

some of whom labelled me as obsessive and uncaring to the world around me.

 This was not true, I simply felt little need to interfere in the balance of things,

and found little interest in the typical trappings of youth,

of love and socialising. I had for more to do than be swoon by a man and serve the wants of society.

My youth was a fruitful time, and little bothered my people. Occasionally darkness would rise,

but there were those around me that countered and balanced, and I for one had little want to 

interfere with the way of things, seemingly in perfect unison of light and dark around me.

As my powers have grown, I have travelled far from home, finally required to seek knowledge elsewhere.

Months abroad passed so quickly, as time often does for me, engrossed in books and wandering to libraries

 across the continents, seeking out time and again the teachings of those who would hear me, and I listened.

 

One particular day I came upon an old tome, a tale of wars long past, and more important to me the tale of Magus.

So lost I felt he was. It saddened me to know that in time he never found his place, it seemed to be his life be spent in confusion,

 though I admit my views appear contrary to most.  He was driven by so many things, and could not find the balance so sought in his life. 

 

 

I read of renegades, those passionate souls, but unguided, they trully are gifted beings, yet thwart all attempts to reign in their powers, and seeks control over their own fates.,

I can understand some of the ideals they seem to live by, the freedom is understandable, yet they limit their own potential by avoiding any control whatsoever.

Personal freedom is a choice, and in choice there is balance, but greed plays a part.  How can one trully wish to live to their full expectation by selfish and wanton chaos? 

 

I have always stiven to balance my personal ambition with a measure of control, for it is through this philosiphy that i find myself a student of life and magic, neither wanting to control all around me, nor to desire to alter the balances in life...unless they are overweighted in  a particular direction.

I believe in the words "Light without darkenss becomes corrupt, and Darkness without consumes itself". One cannot exist without the other, it is the way of things, i firmly believe.

 

I find myself now reaching my pinnacle, yet driven to continue my studies. This cannot occur without direction and guidance of those esteemed members of the conclave and the orders.  I have spent hour upon hour preparing myself to prove worthy of  my craft.

 

It is with great ambition and humility i humbly request to seek council and lesson with the Orders, that I may take The Test, and know once and for all where my life will lead me. 

I have given myself to the moons, and to my magic. My teachers have long pressed that I would suit the red robes, though I know this is not for me to decide. I hope to serve the order, and conclave, to advance and grow to my full potential.

with great humilty

Hey Majere, 

 

Recently I have been pinned with a NoPK flag for complaints that have been targeted at me. But, you only heard there side of the story.

I only think it is faior if you hear mine as well.

 

Gael, who I bet was the guy that constantly complained about me, was casting spells on me every time he saw me. I warned him, and told him to stop or I would make him stop. Well obviously, he never stopped. 

Therefore, as I told him I would do, I stopped him. Well, when he kept doing it, and kept casting spells on me even after I told him to stop the first time. So I told him again to stop or I would make him stop again. 

Well, as you know, he didnt stop, so i kept stopping him, like I kept telling him I would do, and it turned into a never ending cycle. 

And now he knows that I have a NoPK and I can't do anything to him, whenever he sees me, he still casts spells on me. 

 

Anyway, that's my side of the story.

Chidak

{x Friends, the few I have.  Ive heard rumor of the thieves guild

guardian, an executioner.  He's out of place, and his wears should belong to

another.  Dias, I hope your venture into the Conclave succeeds, the strength

of magic is powerful, and the vengeance of the Holy Order is non-surpassed. 

Im the shadow that follows, and the undead clanhall seems to be getting

restless that their guards are constantly caught off guard sleeping.  Its

apparent that we must prepare ourselves, with as much armor as our bodies

can withstand.  We should plan a night soon where we can gather our wears. 

I might be able to...  Aquire, some things.  The risk vs reward is always

their though.  

 

Arlanthis, word of advice, in the shadows, you can always find comfort no

matter where you stay. Seems to piss off the blind undead too.

{cAfter much discussion, and by judging my past performances Head Librarian Gael and me have decided that my talents would best be used As head of the Research department.

I will take over doing task's such as field research, and gathering information that may be found wanted by the Librarian. I will be looking for a Assistant in these tasks.

I will work closely with the collection department, and at times i may be required to perform a task or two for them. My assistant will be required to follow my orders.

Do not worry, my orders will be fair and just. The task i will need my assistant to perform will be of various nature's, maybe helping me in the field, or by recording

The information i gather.

Subject Tragedy ~
Text
{c I am writing this missive To let all know of great tragedy that will come upon many innocents very shortly.

The elven nation has become the target of a Man known as Theriss, it is a target he will reach. As i write these words, 

I watch as his armies draw ever closer to three of these cities. I cannot help but feel that i am at fault for this.

After all i supplied the man with the information he needed, down to the best possible way to take each city.

The only hope i can see is this, They were my plans, and i never make a plan without making a counterplan as well.

I have already put this into motion, as such i would like everyone to treat the citizen's of Silvanosti nicely, they

will be staying in the library until the war is over. The sea elves will be staying in crystal lake near New Haven.

 I have found them a suitable home there, Again only temporary. I have also moved the Qualinsti to a small library hidden within Vingaard forest.

In the place of these citizens i have left Mirrors, Or copies of them. So the invading army will be none the wiser. I am currently in negotiations

 With the Solamnic, Holy order, and Forester's for an imediate counter strike on all three cities.

I will not be taking part in this war. It is a pointless for any of us librarians to take part in it. We are keepers and collectors of knowledge, not fighters. As a head Librarian, Aorac seems a little daft. She should know, just like all of us other librarians to only give knowledge to those who do not wish to disrupt the balance.

Aorac is a fool for what she has done, and deserves whatever fate the gods wish to bestow upon her. If anyone has a problem with how I see this then feel free to seek me out and speak with me.

{cMy choice to interfere is based on one simple fact, The balance cannot exist without the elven nation, if i choose notto act, the elven nation will perish 

At the current standing based on my research, good as a larger area of operation, when compared to evil, While evil has more population. This will

even the scales, bringing the number of cities and the over all population of good to evil to a near null. This is in an attempt to hold the balance for

a longer time. My second motive is for the knowledge the elves have, and have yet shared with use, without them knowledge would be lost.

I can understand how one might be able to misinterpret my actions. On a final note, no librarian will be fighting in this war, The order stands on

present as watch and wait. Record what you see, and make it knowledge for the public.

Dear Players of legends of krynn, i am wrighting to all of you in an out of character note, this has

 been a choice i have been thinking about for a long time, but i think it is my time to stop playing

 legends of krynn, for the time being atleast. Im sorry if i have rp with you or future plans but i 

find myself wondering time and time again why i put up with some of the buff shit

that players pull and are get by with, im tired of playing a game that you can PK on with no rp at 

all and get away with by simply logging off, or saying "oh well he looked at me wrong" im not saying

 any names, Delacroix, and no chris this does not mean you get any of my characters so just stop asking 

already your not getting them, and on that note im not deleting my characters, because i do plan on returning,

 i just dont know when yet, i may log on to check in on people and places from time to time so if you see me on

 ill be on for a few min so ask me what you need then, i have been playing this game for a number of years

 now, more then i like to admit, and it has only gone down hill steadily great players have come and gone, 

and i miss what this game use to be, before it became "my character is stronger then yours in a code battle 

so thats all im gonna do" im sorry it has come to this but i see no other way, because honestly this 

game is pissing me off more then helping me relax because i have to constantly watch over my shoulder 

for some idiot going on a freak pk raid, again friends im sorry its come to this but i see no other way,

 I love you all and you aer all great people, but im sorry a few bad eggs ruined the batch.

and lastly Nuitari, and morgion, i love you guys, your amazing people and someone i would like to 

call my friend, thank you so much for what you have done for me and helped with with, you guys are 

quite possibly the most active immortals on and you have my respect for that, morgion... you have done 

so much to make this game as active and as fun as you can and you are succeeding, im glad to see it, 

your doing an amazing job at what your doing and please keep it up, nuitari, you put up with alot of shit 

and you do alot to keep everyone happy, and you do in most cases keep everyone happy, im glad you are my 

friend and i hope to still see you sitting on your throne in the future.

Hey guys,

 

I left the clan, I haven't been active on this charactor for like a year and i can't remember the RP that brought me to the clan. I know it had to do something as spying for the undead... but i don't know on who or who i would report to since the clan has been rehauled a few times since then.

Because of the memory lapse as i play this charactor again i would like to reexplore my RP options and try to remember where i was going with him. Hopefully this won't cause any hard feelings, and hopefully you won't decide to pursue a pk vendetta...

THe information you seek is this, To save as many lives as possible, evacuate the city.

To move into their own barricades, then bring your forces in to trap them. The number

of enemy troops is as follows, #354 swordsmen,#567 pike/spearmen,#200 archers,#10 officers.

Due to the residents living in tree tops, Calvary will not me used. I have already confirmed

I wanted to talk and consider some options with either of you to be honest

if you would be willing to consider my former immortal status, previous hero

character, and hours spent on this game with small compensation. 

Compensation is the wrong word to use in this particular case because I am

A little while ago I was Lord of Night for quite some time. I went innactive and quit playing LoK as much. Now that I'm back Allyria and Kolf are innactive. I'm really trying to get some rp going with the KoT. So I was wondering if I could have a leader flag. It could even be temporary if you wanted. It'd just help out so much with clan rp and what not.

Fellow Solamnics,

 

I am going to Solanthus for the protection of our empire. The fate of our citizens and that city rests on the willingness of the people to protect and of the Knights of Solamnia to protect the people. 

 

I am aware that only the council can order you duties, and so I will not assign them, but I do ask this: those who can should follow me. I will plead to the council upon my departure for troops to accompany me, who I will hope to station at the High Keep before we make our attack. Our forces will muster there.

 

Those who cannot leave for whatever reason, I will also be asking the Council to triple the guard here, in case Solanthus falls. If Solanthus does not hold, we will have our last stand at the Keep, and then the Army will reach the Jewel of Solamnia.

 

 

Stay strong, my brethren. It is in the Light only that we will be victorious.

 

Est Sularus Oth Mithas.

I write today to ask the Tower to honor our long-standing alliance and give help to our Solamnic Knights as we rush to defend their southern borders.

 

We have long offered protection and solace in our lands for all colored robes of the Tower due to an agreement reached between the Daniel Quickblade and Darkahn Kiralv. I ask you now to honor that agreement and send all variety of your mages to assist my troops in defeating the Knights of Takhisis, whose magic users rebuke the Dark Moon Nuitari.

 

If you will not send help, I ask this of your leaders in respect to our truce: allow your followers of light and neutrality to choose to assist us without penalty.

 

It is my hope that when this threat is over, we may continue to have a peaceful agreement between the Solamnics and the Tower.

Lady Kalaela:

 

You were correct in assuming that there was once a truce, forged between Daniel Quickblade and Darkahn Kiralv. However, the most recent leader of your Knights, Sebastian Quickblade, disagreed with that. Since then, the truce has been abandoned, for we of the Towers refuse to ask anyone permission to kill those who use magic outside of the Tower, which is what the younger Quickblade wanted.

 

I will not stop any of our mages who wish to join against the Queen, however, but nor will I force any to join. I leave it up to their free will and conscience.

 

Also, let it be noted, I wish to meet with you, before your troops march south. And, afterwards, perhaps we can arrange another meeting, in which a new truce can be drafted for our mutual benefit.

When your dream vision becomes clear again a spear, about 8 feet long hovers before you.  It has a haft of polished ivory and the tip is made of a translucent blue crystal. As you reach for the spear an ice dragon's face seems to explode from the spear, causing the blue haze to disappear and you awaken in a cold sweat.

I am writing to you because I wish to enlist in the queens army. The Solamnics in palanthas appear to be getting extremly tired of the Queens follwers roaming their streets. That is not the only reason I wish to enlist, for I believe I can be usefull in the coming skrimishes.

I am a conjuror living in palanthas; My family lives in the south closer to Solanthus, before the seige was started I left the city to study in palanthas. That is where I came upon a cleric of Lady Chaos.

I wish to help bring order to this world. The solamnics allow to much freedom. That leads to chaos. Order must be brought to all in the land. The only way to do so is through the queens will.

I write to you to inform you that i have obeyed your command and studied the scrolls you gave me, I must admit to some confusion as to why you had so many copies of a tavern song in different languages but I defer to your judgement. I also wish to thank you for the kindling to my evenings fire.
 
I have spent the spare time I had after burning.. studying.. your scrolls in the library in Xak Tsaroth. I picked up an ancient scroll on enchanting runes and have found some applications that are not so obvious.

Mages of the Conclave,
 
I hope this missive finds you all in good health and spirits. My 
name is Zendfrel (no surname or house). I am a mortician and 
gravedigger for Palanthas and a few other cities.  As a member of the 
guild of Necromancy I sought ought your organization and I have passed 
my testing. I was told that at this point I should seek out a teacher and 
reveal a little of my history to my new brothers and sisters at arms as it 
were. 
 
    I was born in Qualinesti and I am a first generation half-elf. My 
parents are deceased, their untimely deaths leading to both of my 
mundane and magical careers suffice it to say. I was raised in on the 
outskirts of Solace and eventually moved to Palanthas where I reside 
now
 
    I am very eager to begin my training though I am not quite sure 
how this all works. I am interested in learning from all magical walks and 
ethical paths. I am a firm believer that true power comes from 
understanding not only ones self but the world around you. I look 
forward to meeting you all and finding a suitable master.

My fellow Conclavians, a time comes when a new order is needed.  That

is that Phiaera is never here when needed and we need a leader not a person

I believe there is a thiing that auto delete's people after not signing
on for such a long time.  I'm not sure if anyone has gotten up with you yet,
but what you need to do is type up a note to Hiddukel of what has happened
and what alts you have lost.  Odd's are he will restore them for you.  Trust
me your not the first this has happened to.  Also not sure why it's set up
like this.  Anyways hope I was able to be of help.

Text
{y The letter contains dirt stains and poor Kagonesti hand-writing.  Dear
Conclave, I thank you for taking the time to dispatch one of your own to
personally invite me into the Conclave.  My name is Elenra Lafeur and I am
of the Kagonesti tribe Winter's Night, atleast, I was until they cast me
out.  I am a mingled blood, my birth was only a result of an unfortunate
human raid.  That alone stained me in the eyes of my tribe.  Ever since I
was old enough to walk on my own I have been plagued with nightmares of
horrible events.  The Massacring of my own Kagonesti tribe, senseless
slaughterings of other elfen races, visions of the atrocities done to my
bloodline in the past.  These became realities to me at night, I lived these
horrors and I've adapted, and I've changed.  Shamanism and Druidism are the
only magics permitted within my tribe.  Even then, such magics are only
given and taught to those closest to my Chieftain's bloodline.  One
unfortunate day the changed had shown within me.  Wretched shadows of myself
project from me, I myself become one with the shadow and completely
invisible to the naked eye.  These magics emerged from me and it was
apparent that I had been cursed.  The shamans and druids of my own tribe
came to the conclusion that I am haunted by the ghosts and horrors of the
past.  My tainted blood and corrupted magic served only to prove that I was
forever cursed by the ill-fated whom dwell in the past.  Thus I was banished
from my tribe.  The only honors bestowed to me were the trip to this city
and the tattered ceremonial robes of ancient Kagonesti shamans.  I
understand you within the conclave call this magic Illusionism.  I believe
it to be a curse but I will acknowledge that your races have a better grasp
of this phenomenon.  Even if you do not accept me atleast grant me the
hospitality.

If the White Moon has given an approval, then it should be.  And speaking of Theriss.. He got his second chance and blew it.  So Telmus will be on watch and on a very tight leash.  He will be observed at all times.. whether by me.. or someone else.

Master,
 
     The minotaur Zarrel has been working as a deck hand for the past few years and has only recently learned or taken interest in his powers.
According to him he (and I'm assuming his twin brother) were born albino minotaurs with the runes on their horns.
I was unable to tell what they mean and he does not seem to know himself however their is a legend in his clan that the founders (also a mage and warrior, perhaps a battlemage) birthed two albino twins as well.
There seems to be some expectation of greatness there, however, it seems that it goes along with some tension of being born an abnormality.
Though he wants to join the black robes I do not think his heart is all together evil. When asked about morality he said he believed that animal instinct was right and I quote "When an another animal steals something from an animal he either fights to take it back or finds another. I prefer the first option."
He seems to be looking for his purpose and may believe that his birth (similar to his clan's founder's children) could mean something fortuitous for him.
As I said before his brother has no interest in joining him and from the conversation, though I did not let on that I had met his brother, he seems at odds with his brothers morality so if he were coaxed to join it would not be for our order.

Tim texted me and told me you wrote this note and put it out there - And I just wanted to say, don't bother.
 
The immortals dont give a shit, no one does. This mud goes through yearly scenes, where players just start disappearing then coming back when holidays were over.
 
Immortals pull some gay shit, yeah, thats believable...ive seen it done, but its whatever. This mud sucks, all muds suck. I already e-mailed hidd about it and told him I won't be back, so I just thought id address this note to you.
 
You got my number, so holla at me sometime man. And if you get in some trouble with the imms and start throwin shit at em like I did, tell em Xavier motherfuckin fortelli told you to do so.

Due to a lack of playerbase, and the odds and ends of how this MUD is turning out to be. Chemosh and I have both agreed that we need to let Dargaard Mountains slide as the playerbase starts to dwindle. I know its our territory and such, and I'm the worst about it, but we need to lighten up as a guild.
 
From this point forward, the RP can still go on if the other people agree to it - But if their solely to level, just let them be. Its gonna be hard for me to do it, but lets just wait til Krynn reaches its peak again before we worry.

The answer to your question of having a higher leveled instrument is no. The reason why is your songs effectiveness is based on the instrument.
 
A friend of mine actually got a permenant drum that the quest master tells you to find through rp and I can tell you that if there were an instrument higher than 65, the bard would be overly powered. He was level 85 and was able to mass paralysis 4 out of 5 lvl 101's in the same room and silence pretty much anybody he pleased

To: Hiddukel
Hiddukel, I've spoken off and on with a couple of the Immortal staff
concerning a possible return of Quinlin, and if it was worth my trying to
lobby for his return.  When I deleted the character, it was indeed a brash
and poorly-thought decision, but at the time I thought it better to remove
myself completely rather than continue to watch what I thought to be a
decline in both my play, and the players with whom I interacted.  Having
stepped away from Legends of Krynn for some time now, and reminiscing about
the thousands of hours I've spent immersing myself within what it has to
offer, I thought I would very humbly ask if it was possible to have him
returned.  While it saddens me that I no longer see the old faces I'd become
accustomed to, I do take some pride in being a player that -is- one of those
older faces, and I think that Quinlin still has a lot to offer to this MUD. 
I thank you for your consideration, and await an answer at your convenience.
 
Sincerely,
Zane (Quinlin/Dhimas)

Ignore them. If they attack you with their "Holy Crusade" then tell an immortal/me and they'll be dealt with (some immortals are too lenient or side with them.) If you roleplay with them, it's almost garenteed they'll try to settle it in you're death, so avoid roleplay with them as well. They have cocky attitudes and until I see them roleplay, I'm assuming they have horrible tastes too.
 
One last note: Holy Order is not KoT's enemy, Solamnics are. Don't take their view and start killing any good person/Holy Order member on site. Unless we do an rp about how we should remove Holy Order from this world, ignore them fully. Just thought I'd help a fellow KoT member out. This is an OOC note by the way.

Fellow Mages, 
I have only recently returned to the White Robes after more than five decades. As very few of you know I left the Leadership of the White Robes after being accused of betrayal by Darkhan. The Conclave did not believe my innocence and I accepted my fait.
After more than fifty years of roaming the entire Krynn without being allowed the use of magic, I finally decided to return to the one place that I can really call home. 
The reception of the leadership of the Conclave was far better than I expected which gave me hope of finding the Halls of Wayreth stronger than before my departure.
Unfortunetly I was wrong... At the present time I find myself to be the only White Robe with a regular presence at our halls, our Mistress Phiaera is nowhere to be seen and there are no new apprentices to carry on with our knowledge or High Mages that can take Leadership in the future.
For the above reasons I find myself forced to take actions into my own hands. Therefore I wish to relieve Phiaera of her leadership at the White Robes and once again become Master. Do not think that I do this light hearted, my intention when rejoining the Conclave was simply to come home.
 
If in the future, Phiaera or any other mage show the will, character and availability to become Leader I will gladly stand down. That will be a sign that the White Robes are growing once more.
The first steps towards the growth of the Conclave are going to be conversations with the Leaders of the Holy Order and also of the Knights of Solamnia. 
In the past the alliance between the 3 Orders have proven to be the best solution to control the Undead and the Knights of Tahkisis. By increasing the safety in our towns we will be capable of growing in number since the young apprentices will no longer be affraid of showing themselves.
I hope that you, my brothers and sisters, independently of the Robes you wear, support me in my quest to bring back the White Robes and the Conclave to the place that they belong.
 
Signed,
Telmus Bracarus - The Returned Master

Ansalon.  I do not ask you to sacrifice anything you are not willing to part

with.  In fact, I offer security.  No members will willing attack other

members, or be asked to kill members of their own Guild.  All that is asked

is non-interference with brothers if they must take up the task.  Assigned

members will recieve commission for work completed, and full equipment

replacement in case of accidents will be provided.  I will be in

negotiations with the Thieves Guild for supply requisition and immunity.  In

return, refraining from accepting jobs on them.  They can also assist on

jobs that Assassins may not be equipped to do.  There are more benefits,

Subject Your Story~
Text
It was a good story; well written and balanced. There was only one thing that I found "wrong" about it as I do about anybody that uses LoK as their information source for the undead.
 
I tell you this so you know for future rp/story related information:
 
Chemosh's image should be more of a gate keeper than a devil as he guides the dead to their after life after they die. What creates the UNDEAD in Krynn/Dragonlance is regret, failure, deciet, trickery, ect.
 
Probably the most known book character that is Undead is Lord Soth. Just type his name in google and you'll get his wiki. His story is a pretty amazing one and if you do plan on reading the books (if you haven't already), then skip the section under War of Souls. He's a text book example of how the undead come to be.
 
Now what the books tell you that the internet probably won't is that the undead are like an invincible army with leashes. A banshee will make your brain pop at the sound of her voice and a wraith will freeze your blood. Although it is just a game, I'm trying to get people to deal with the undead in a different way you would with other clans.
 
Last bit of information for you if you even care, undead with big backgrounds like Lord Soth are impossibe to defeat without the strongest of magic users. I ain't going to hassle you or anybody if they don't listen to my undead rant, but I just thought it'd be nice if you knew.

Hey clan! I am back... with vengeance, blood, and glory... and cookies! I'd love to meet up with you guys and get to know you, and your characters. I also have some ideas about how we could change our clanhall. I don't know about your guys, but there are quite a few rooms in there that just... suck. Like the Office. I'd love to perhaps add a few more rooms, a little flavor text to the current rooms. 
 
Dessan had a good idea about adding a graveyard for you necrophiles--I mean Necromancers-- so you could use cadavoring bones, maybe a few bodies that respawn so we can cast animate dead. I'd like a safe room myself. Let's just come up with some ideas, get 'em together, and I'll present them to Hidd and see about getting a builder Immortal in on it.
 
I plan on vamping up the roleplay factor in our clan. A few new rules. Like... restricting the use of the true mark saying, I'd like to come up with an initiation ritual and requirements for joining. I expect good roleplay out of this clan, and some major ass-kickery. Ya'll ready to show these goodie-two-shoes the power of Death?!

To Whom It May Concern:
 
I, Oroszlan Udinesi, wish to join the Solamnic Knighthood. I am a fairly advanced warrior, and would like to work with the Knights. I hail from a little-known region on the other side of Ash, where my father is the local Count. Yet that does not affect me, as I am not set to inherit the title for some time. Because of that, my father thought it wise for me to come learn some of the Knighthood, and perhaps join. I also wish to join, to eradicate the evil that plagues this land.
 
You can find me in Palanthas, most times. If not, please send a note, letting me know what I must do to join your ranks.
 
In the Emperor,

I am the descendant of a human bloodline known as UtMar that has been resident in Palanthas since its beginning, I grew up here and lived here most of my life, living in Solanthus for a few years. 
As I aged I became more aware of what was happening in the world around me and the growth of evil in our presence, I dedicated my time to find way to make my loved ones safe, so it would be remarkable if I could join the services of the Solamnic Knights, not only to further protect my loved ones but all else who need help where ever they may be.

Text
In accordance with the Measure, Volume II subsection III.V- Volume III:{c

All persons serving in the Solamnic Auxillery and Squires are prohibited
from placing charges onto suspected criminals.  If a crime is perpetrated,
it is the duty of the victim to report the crime to the Lady High Justice
Kalaela for a review of the charges.  At least one witness is necessary, and
they may submit their statement in writing.  Any member of the Auxillery or
a Squire caught violating this law shall be charged with treason and serve
time in prison.  I will consider time served as justice for the violation
and will not remove you from the Auxillery, however a second charge will
result in time served again, and cast from the ranks.  Squires will be
punished equally.  This charge can only be applied by the High Justice.  
 
All charges shall be recorded in the book. Use a Whom, What, Where, and Why format if known.
(Example: Lord Farquad charged Sir Michael for assault in the temple. Reason for assault, victim disrespected subject) Challenges of honor or duels will not result in a charge. The victim must make a complaint.
 
Knights of the Rose can supersede any other Knight with the exception of the Leaders of each Order. Their position is in command of the battle. Failure to obey a lawful order will result in 45 days hard labor and reduction in rank.
 
The leaders of each order shall command their order without interference from the others. While a Knight of the Sword outranks a Knight of the Crown, he has no authority to bypass any orders from the High Warrior, or take control of a Squire except in dire circumstances.
 
All members shall address their supervisors with their appropriate title. All supervisors shall address their subordinates by theirs. This ensures discipline and mutual respect.
 
All current leaders must submit a roster of deeds accomplished by their subordinates monthly. The Lady High Justice shall conduct reviews of the High Warrior and High Clerist. I shall conduct hers. This will provide information to help determine promotions and awards. Information for specific Leader's duties and assignments shall be delivered to their quarters at a later date.

A courier approaches you, handing you a small, black leather journal with a bit of black parchment attached to the front. The parchment reads as follows. 
 
{rGreetings to the favored Knights of Takhisis. My name is Vanisia Seregon, and I have aspirations of joining your ranks. Enclosed you'll find a small excerpt of my earlier years and reasoning behind my decision. I hope you'll find its contents informative. If you have any further questions for me, I can most often be found within the Portal of Palanthas. Until then, I look forward to hearing from one of you.{w
 
{DMay the Dark Queen see you victorious in falling Her enemies. 
 
Signed, in brilliant ivory ink,
{W
Vanisia Seregon{w
 
The journal reads as follows. 
 
I suppose journals are a good thing to keep. Though I am not accustomed to such things, I hope that one day when I am dead and The Dark Queen has accepted me in death that my tales may be heard and be a valuable source of knowledge. 
 
I should start with my family, as every story must have a beginning. Though mine is not quite so impressive or attention getting as the novels of old. The blood of the Silvanesti runs through my veins and through the veins of my forefathers. They are quite prude in this sense, a very pride stricken clan that was, needless to say, a bit perturbed when I began to fall from grace. 
 
I met a woman Knight in my ventures, a soul I admired in my youth. I came to idolize her, stealing time away from my family duties to seek her out and hear more of the tales she had to tell.
 
See, she spoke of a Dark Queen. A most powerful and fear inspiring Deity who commanded the forces of Darkness toward the goal of the ultimate annihilation of the world of Krynn.  I was entranced by such a concept. Never before had I seen someone so dedicated  to the will of another. In my clan you were to live for yourself and for your blood. Take care of your own needs before the needs of others. Thus it was indeed a strange concept to watch this lady Knight regale me with tales of her Dark Mistress. 
 
In turn, I became infatuated with the practice as well. I ventured to study of their ranks, their tactics and   their vision; their vision of One World Order. At first, I wished to become like my lady Knight. To be within my Dark Queen's armies, upon the front lines, slaughtering those that dare question Her. I would speak Her name to all, demanding submission and obedience to Her will. But my Lady knight spoke of another. She spoke of a Knight of the Skull, a Priest. I thought it odd for one versed in th
the clerical profession could lead Her armies, at first. But it began to make sense as she admitted her own infatuation with the High Priest. Those were the favored of Her lady, and upon finding that, I knew my path in life. 
 
This path, I knew, was  much better suited for me. With silver tongue and unclouded eyes I would venture to join their ranks and study beneath the one she spoke so highly of. Naturally, when my family found this out, I was outcast. It was a funny thing; I was not upset that  they had come to hate me. But when I told them of my Dark Queen and Her mission, they denied her.
 It was not anger that I felt for them at that point. With ease and a collected mind I pitied them for their stupidity. How, I wondered, could one possibly question Her will? How could they choose death when such a glorious mission awaited them? But choose death they did, and their lives were ended by my hand in the name of my Dark Lady Takhisis. 
 
I severed the ties with my blood line, for such a thing no longer mattered. Attachments to such a paltry thing would surely cloud my aspirations to serve my Queen to the fullest. Nothing could possibly steer me from my path. I, a cleric of The Dragon Queen, will serve Her will to my last breath. But that is far off in the distance now. The death of those who do not submit will surely keep me entertained as I venture to that destiny.

I personally am delighted at the thought of roleplay between Solamnic and KoT, but my character, Zeak, holds no significant rank to uphold such duties. None the less, I shall roleplay with you and any accompanying Solamnic when time permits.
 
I got a lot to do Thursday and I'm not so sure about Friday (I will be on though), so I'm going to ask any KoT members if they would like to join me in rp and aim for it on Saturday.
 
On another note, KoT members seem to be hit and miss on log in's and we've only had on good rp which seemed like it would continue for a few days but died almost instantly. The leaders seem to be taking vacation and Takhisis is acting as temp leader to try and keep it somewhat active. So regardless if I get higher athority to "take part" in the talk or not, I will be joining.
 
Lastly, Theriss said that he will not be taking part in the talk. I quote "Yeah, I'm not sitting in on nothing. It's war!" Given that it was 100% Theriss that killed your Solamnic after summon, this is somewhat of a shame. However, as a fair notice, he did say he MIGHT drop by after rp if he's on to give all that he can offer (death.)
 
I know I sad lastly, but this is actually the lastly. Zeak is an Aurak draconian. Intelligent and smaller than the rest of the draconians (but pretty big for human standards.) It's up to you how you view Zeak but I didn't want you to view Zeak as a regular Baaz Draconian.

Theriss misses the big picture. He can't technically be the leader, so I consider all attacks by him fringe warfare. Unfortunately this MUD has gotten used to exerting control by just summoning random people, killing them, and claiming victory. It's silly. Realistically we command armies, and those are the ones that do most of the invading..sure you have to make allowances for combat, and normal strength, but it is in no way decided by random PK.
 
Honestly I'm trying to encourage someone to take over the KoT by all of this, because having some flunky claim to stall the army of Takhisis is, simply put, retarded.
 
There will be no RP until your house gets in order, and I may just declare war while your leadership is in tatters. I'm trying to do you and the MUD here a favor by encouraging good RP, whereas I could just have everyone repeatedly attack all of you which isn't any fun.
 
P.S. Auraks are supposed to be the biggest, coming from gold dragons. around 7 feet tall and wingless. I don't know if you RP a runt or not, just thought you should know.

Kolf and Allyria are still coded leaders, but Takhisis has taken it up to change the pace of KoT with a non-leader idol for kot (if you read the books, pretty much Mina from the War of Souls series.) 
 
I'm actually thinking about stepping up and doing something with KoT myself though since nobody really wants to. I just feel that I won't be able to do as satisfactory of a job that I want to.

Subject Magic, and how it should be used~
Text
A scroll is on your person but you do not remember how, as you unroll it you read carefully because the handwriting is a tad sloppy.
'{rKnights of Solamnia,
My name is Yerthorn Stormspell, Ordermaster of the red robes of the conclave. I would like to inquire as to whom has been saying they have been threatened by our "hunters" for we do not target simply any mage, wizard, or simple turner of tricks.
Our renegade hunters target only renegades, if someone has come to you and has felt threatened then they may be someone of the most terrible sorts. Most renegades whom follow a dark master, will be destroyed because they near always refuse to turn themselves in. However, even those that follow one of the lords of light, no matter how good they appear are still renegades if they use magic without reserve.
I would like to ask of you to, Turn a blind eye" towards our methods of aprehending gray robes... For they are abominations to the world. And surely if they are with one of their nonmagical brothers, we would be glad to turn them over to you post-haste.
As for your earlier missive, some Sinjin and Arlanthis I believe. We cannot stop hunting renegades, the boundries set up by nations have little hold on what a wizard will do. And we will stop them anywhere.
Signed, Yerthorn Stormspell

I write this not to undermine either of you merely to say that Akyros has been deemed ready to be tested. His test will however be more difficult than one whom claims to just be learning the art of magic. He claims to be skilled, and thus will be tested as a skilled wizard. If he passes, if I am also unable to test him, however i should be able to, he will be an apprentice until we all agree otherwise.

Text
Dear Majere,
I know you recently put sinjin and i in the solamnics but some things are afoul and i thought
I would just give you a heads up beforehand so you would understand where we are coming from if things
go sour.So we inducted aleksei to add poeple and give as many poeple as we could a chance to
roleplay and have fun cause they probly just stand around alot.So all of a sudden aleksei the squire
we inducted is grandmaster.Now ive always been told the clans rest in the hands of the mortals
and im assuming hab got on and he is buddies with him or something and asked him to make him grandmaster.
Now we got several problems with that cause there is supposed to be a voting process for that kind of thing.
especially in the solamnics.There was none of that. another thing is you have to earn respect from poeple
who are supposed to be under you in a chain of command.We dont know this guy.We had just started to build a relationship
with this guy and bam. he expects us to respect him.Sinjin and i are out there slaying evil and holding
down justice and he has barely ever got on until recently.We have never welded swords together against evil or anything.
I know im not one to write notes like this but we find it unacceptable and are gonna confront him
and give him a chance to speak for himself but what will most likely go down is us leaving.us slaying him 
and being kicked out by him i guess? but either way we cant stand for it and wont so thats the heads up :P
Good day to you, I shall drink a beer to you when we commence justice protocol :)

Greetings, Esteemed Knights of Solamnia,

Hopefully, continued support and backing, for both sides, can continue in our long line of successes, most of which I've seen from the Knighthood's eyes.
 
I have taken command of the Order, and shall make every attempt I can in order to keep communication and information flowing between our prestigious orders. If you have any further questions, feel free to send them to the Holy Order as a whole, or myself, personally, and I'll respond as quickly as I can.

I aim to allow the Order to gain some form of hierarchy, so we're not all running around blind.

Tue Mar 15 09:37:45 2011
To: Hiddukel
Hiddukel,
 
Howdy, I hope the day finds you well.  I have been talking for awhile with some of the Gods
and other players about reviving the playerbase and the possible ways to do it.
I get on very often and I think it's fair to say 75% of the time I get on I am one of two players, if
not the only one on.  This happens for hours at a time at all different times of day.  As a mudder,
it's pretty depressing.  I know how awesome it would be if we could get a large active playerbase,
people feed off of large groups on muds and it instantly creates an awesome gaming environment.  That's
what I want for this mud.  Everyone I talk to on the matter agrees that more players would be what
Krynn needs to get a second wind.
 
I have a suggestion to bring in more players, while making older players more active.  I am not entirely
sure how your building/coding process works on Krynn, but the MUDs I have come from the Gods were responsible
for editing and building new zones, while the implementers would review their submissions before adding
them to the mix.  I built a few zones that were added on TP and I know it's not difficult with a little practice.
The EQ on Krynn is suffering as well.  Even if you did not want to add new zones, atleast add additional mobs
with a variety of equipment for all players.  The choices are slim especially at high level and the result is
players with the same eq restrung to different things.  That's not exciting, part of the fun is customizing
your character to follow a specific stat, or a myriad of stats.  Atleast give the option for higher levels to
expand their character.
 
There are several willing volunteers in your staff, I ask that you consider allowing them to improve on what
you have already made.  I am watching the MUD's playerbase starve to death and I don't want to be the only person
on all the time.  The prospect of having a ton of active players is really exciting to me and everyone else
that enjoys this MUD.
 
Respectfully and sincerely,
Sinjin

Subject The White Raven~
Text
{WAn earsplitting caw sounds from overhead, announcing the presence of a strangely pigmented raven whose feathers are a flawless shade of ivory. Its eyes a beady red show albinism, and can be easily seen as it drops a piece of rolled up parchment at your feet. Upon opening it, crimson ink can be seen scribbled across its center and it reads:
 
{rMy Dark Brothers and Sisters,
 
I am known as Dominique Lahara, a devout follower of The Dark Lord Morgion. It has only been a short while since I have arrived to these lands and already I have noticed an unacceptable presence of the followers of the Light. Such a sight pains my eyes and I can scarcely stand to see it go on a moment more. This is why I sent this request to join your ranks. Let my blade aid you, and aid the Dark Gods in reclaiming these lands to who they truly belong to.
 
I am easily found within the Port City. You may seek me there.
 
Signed in white ink,
{WDominique Lahara, The White Raven
 
The albino raven releases another caw, and flies off as you finish reading.{w

Dear Theriss,
I write to you now in hopes that this message will get word to you.  My
name is Evelyn Midnight.  I hail to the great Queen of All.  I have been
wronged today by the man named Arlanthis.  I attempted to leave his vile
city in peace, to his disdain of my pride in the Queen.  He had then saw
fit to put bogus charges upon me, and him as his little lackies made a
run to humiliate me for their own pride.  I want revenge, to gain back my
honor and my name, and justice for the true crime; seeking to smite me
down when I had taken no hostile action, and even made to LEAVE his so
called pathetic Palanthas.  I pray to the Queen's name that you will see
me worthy of assisstance in my goals.

I am writing this letter to request an audience with the high warrior. I am Linx, of the kagonesti elves, and I wish to become a member of the holy knights of solamnia. I have already been informed by a very old member that I would not be able to join the order of the crown, or the order of the sword, but they did tell me that I would be able to join the auxillary.
As I said earier, I am a kagonesti elf, born and raised in the wilds. The hawk droping off this missive is actually my life long companion, his name is Xavi. He will not harm anyone unless ordered to., and is a very loyal, and really fast messenger. I am a msuic lover, one who can lull someone to sleep, or use my music to lift someone morale.
I have travelled very far to seek an audience, and as such, I will be in the portal for the night to rest up.{x

[I wrote up a small document that I wanted to post as an OOC note to get more followers into the Black Order. I just wanted you guys to review it and let me know if everything I said is not against any rules or lore. Let me know what you think.]
 
[The following is an OOC Note]
 
The Black Order is an infamous clan of individuals dedicated to the advancement of the Dark Gods and Goddesses of Krynn. Most keep gossip of them to the whispers within dark taverns and alleys, as their ears and eyes reach past even the most secure threshold, with a variety of races and professions to get any job fulfilled in any amount of time with the requested level of bloodshed, all for the glory of Darkness. 
 
Their core consists of a council, its members compromised by the heads of each evil Faith.
 
The Death Cultist of Chemosh rests at the tables head, the leader of the entire clan, Oracle Dominique Lahara, The White Raven. Decisions are ultimately made by her and The Lord of Deaths agenda is usually favored. 
 
Then there is The Plague of Morgion; yet to be filled.
 
 
The Torrent of Zemboim; yet to be filled.
 
 
The Dark Magic of Nuitari; yet to be filled. 
 
 
The Volcano of Sargonnas; yet to be filled.
 
 
And the Dragon Knight of Takhisis; yet to be filled. 
 
 
Each lead is responsible for their Deitys respective followers within the clan and enticing brothers and sisters of Faith to join their ranks. 
The following prefaces are available in ascending order with only one Oracle. 
 
Initiate
Adept
Desciple
Invoker
Oracle
 
Members begin as Initiates and may advance through the ranks of the clan by proving their worth to their respective Deities and the Oracle. Various tests may be given in order to decide whether a rise in rank is deserved. And with the leader being partial to sacrificial acts, participation within routine cult meetings is a necessity.

I know that this is not something that will take days, or weeks even but I am willing to give the rest of my life to the causes of honor and justice. I come from a small farm in the woods west of palanthas where my father taught me as well as he could of manners and such.
I know not to strike a lady, visit temple no less than twice a week, and to help those less off than myself. I wish merely to help bring peace and justice to the lands I call home.

With this statement, let it be known, that ANY whom seek to journey on and forsake themselves of this Order, will be punished. I will grant you leave, for the price of your life, or your things. (OOC: Basically guys, no leaving the clan without a kill and full sac. Trying to crack down and make this MUD, and clan, ALOT more serious. So, call me a dick if you want, but this clan is no longer for the weak of heart.)
 
Also, those who are no longer worthy to serve under the reign of the dark gods, shall be removed from status within the Order. The Oracle Dominique and I shall weed out the weak, and fortify the strong.
 
May the Dark Gods favor you in your journeys,
{bNightmaster

Muira: New areas
Sat Apr  9 20:10:30 2011
To: Hiddukel
Hi there!
 
I have several ideas for new areas, and I hear you're looking for builders.  Though I'm not very adept at coding, I can write the descriptions for the areas, maps, exits, mobs, as well as give ideas for loot.
 
I've written such for a few MUDs and MUSHes in the past.  Perhaps if someone could give me a blank template for the coding, I could fill in the blanks and send it back, allowing the Coder to check it over and just copy/paste it in.
 
One of my ideas would be an area simply for lvls 90-101.  Bashing bats and getting 300 exp per isn't ideal, though I could see how one would actually have to WORK for that last level.  Perhaps they could be running through a mine, killing little squatty-body dwarves that throw chunks of rock at them, as well as those nasty-sharp pickaxes.
 
Anyhow, let me know what you think, and if I can help in any way!  I'd love the opportunity!
 
Muira

OOC note. Hey, i just had a favor to ask of you. Back when Takhisis played, the very last time i saw her online she marked me as High Cleric, and said in a tell that i would get the title and all that the next time we RP. It's being a pain trying to rp as a high cleric without the title of being so, even though i have it in code. Other immortals cant do anything about it, or atleast they say they cant, so i thoughti would ask you.
point being, i need the title of high cleric so ill be taken more seriously by the other kot members when i tell them i have orders from takhisis (another immo started an rp that gave me orders.)

{Y*A report is left within the Solamnic Headquarters stationed in the city of Palanthas*
{/{/{BAuxillary recruit Iskassa Valinor Reports: {/{/{bA draconian proceeded to attack me this day. I was standing my usual guard before the Temple of the Skyblade, after my hourly patrol, and the female draconian came from out of nowhere. I declared that she was charged with assault, and proceeded to chase her down.
I have laid eyes upon this draconian before, and i am sure i'm not the only one. I do believe it is the one that made assault a few nights ago, also before the Temple of Skyblade, on a young girl known as Muira. She openly praises the Dark Queen, and left the city with her magic.
 
Seeing as how the draconian would so easily, and without regret, attack an innocent civilian, and even an auxillary recruit, I made my way to the Stronghold of Takhisis' Soldiers. I refuse to shield myself with the same magics you choose to, but i did enlist the aid of a potion maker to the southwest of Solanthus, name Salusa. Those potions allowed me to gain access to the Stronghold unseen, and proceed to apprehend this draconian.
 
I am sorry to say, that after some time and a bit of a struggle, the draconian finally fell to the inevitable doom that is Justice. I could not allow myself to possibly risk another life be harmed, or given to Aeleth's minions... I feel deep remourse for my actions, but I feel i must report... I executed this Draconian within the very Temple that is the Dragon Queen.
 
Quickly reinforcements began to arrive, so I rushed away, and was met with a formidable force, Khisanth the Dragon. I narrowly escaped before the Thorn Knights could hunt me with their magic, and made my way back to this city of Palanthas. I feel as though this report is important, so i leave it with the steward that guards our Grandmaster's room. I do hope that it reaches you, before the next attack from the Dark Queen's army.

There hasen't been any official word yet, but there are two people (that I can recall) that have submitted an application for immortality (Oh lord if I could do that in real life..). All of you should have received the notes on the MUD, and i'm calling a vote amongst immortals, to see where heads lie. Please vote Yay or Nay, applicants are:
 
Sera - New blood, recent to the MUD, and promising roleplay. I'm very iffy, based on the fact that's she's new to MUDs in general. She has no offenses and has had no trouble with other players or our staff. However, I will vouch for her roleplaying and credibility, seeing as that I have known her personally for the past two years. It would be nice to have someone on the staff with a viewpoint that is new overall. Yay.
 
Delacroix - He's gone through a lot of trouble in the past, having been one of our infamous Ohio County School Rule Breakers. He's had OOC shit storms, and is hard to reason with when hot-headded. However, I see that he has a lot of determination, and perhaps in that, a lot of potential. He's applied multiple times (as far as I know) and has been rejected. His persistance and his capability of roleplay suggests to me that perhaps he is worth a chance. His trouble in the past STRONGLY pushes me towards no,
but for once, i'm going to say yes and see where my faith goes. I say yay.

To Our Nightmaster, It is important to travel lightly in that world.  He

who carries too heavy a burden will regret it I have looked upon several

hours within our great Dark Library and have found scraps and pieces of what

we have seen.  I implore you take this knowledge with great secrecy.. 

'{rThe First Sign / And God said, / At the time of fullness, cleanse the /

world with my rage.  / Gather forth the White Oil, the Black / Cup and the

Blood of the Ten Sinners.  / Prepare for the Ritual of the Holy Assumption. 

The Second Sign / And the God said, / Offer the Blood of the Ten Sinners and

/ the White Oil.  / Be then released from the bonds of the / flesh, and gain

the Power of Heaven.  / From the Darkness and Void, bring / forth Gloom, /

and gird thyself with Despair of the / Giver of Wisdom.  {x (This part of

the entry was too deteriorated to read..)  In my years of wisdom, I

recommend that you focus our efforts on seeking out the Receiver of Wisdom. 

Only then may the message unfold.  As for the ten sinners, I have found

record of those that have abandoned the order long ago, though ...  Over and

over He calls to our soul.  Emptiness surrounds you no one can help if the

angels refuse you now...  Rewnoyk the unholy cleric of {DMorgion{x

Hey Josh, how have you been?  We're going to need to catch each other

recruiting..  And there are greater events going on right now as well.  I

wanted to voice my concern over Mharik joining our clan..  His hours are

quite..  Low in my opinion to be level 100 which leads me to suggest that he

donated.  Now, with only 50 hours on this character, I cannot say for

certain that his roleplay is Solid and I have a sneaking suspicion that we

will get burned more than we would be honored with him in the clan.  Tread

lightly with this player my friend..  I'm uncertain of his intentions just

Morgion: Nightmaster Duties/Role
Sun Mar 28 15:01:38 2010
To: glorfilith
The Nightmaster of Morgion is the mortal end of Morgion's will, he or she

must be a priest of his faith, commonly held by humans and not much else,

they tap into the same essence of favor that the diviners do and then some. 


Command, usually giving the orders when a branch of the cult is too far away

from the dictator him or herself.  The dictator usually in the 'blessing' of

Morgion is deformed due to the sheer power granted to him or her.  Such

deformities would usually be made unnoticeable before the dictator goes into

public either by the illusionists, or by some other means.  The dictator

attempts to keep his rank out of the knowledge of any of the associates and

initiates of the cult.  Along with this, his subordinates are not allowed to

reveal to these ranks, who the current dictator is.  Such a thing could

prove hazardous.  Wherever the dictator goes he is usually accompanies by a

mage or fighter of at least the 'Silencer' rank, any less would be

ill-becoming of him or her.  The dictator tends to throw their weight around

at times to those who are of standard rank, putting them in their place when

needed.  The dictator also makes the decision of when a member shall be

banished, and if the member is banished, what their significant 'parting

gift' shall be, whether it be death, or a peaceful banish.  There is no

advancement beyond the Nightmaster and new nightmasters are rarely chosen,

unless the current one dies.  The Nightmaster never strays from the faith,

along with the favors Morgion grants his divine voice on Krynn, he also

makes it impossible for them to scheme away from his faith.  It is however

possible for the nightmaster to become a hit of an assassination, such a

case is however rare, as the cult attempts to make the dictator unknown to

those not of rank within the order, and as traitors are usually killed, the

information usually does not get around.

Morgion: The Blackorder
Tue Mar 30 08:51:24 2010
To: blackorder
A BLACKORDER TOME

 

The Holy Orders of the Stars are the faiths that worship the 21 true gods of 

Krynn -- by whatever names they know them. Just as the pantheon consists of 

three celestial families, so too, the gods' worshipers fall into three holy 

orders. Priests of a Good god belong to the Order of Light, those of an Evil god 

belong to the Order of Dark, and those of a Neutral god belong to the Order of 

Balance. 

 

Relations between the Factions: 

Although the Orders of High Sorcery work together for the cause of magic, the 

three Holy Orders have far more hostile relations. To priests, ethos means 

everything, so to work with the other orders is to deny one's only purpose in 

life. If any alliance occurs between the orders, it exists because each thinks 

it can advance its own cause. 

 

(On the Legends of Krynn, we have divided the dark and light orders into the 

Holyorder and the Blackorder. There is no current faction for the priests of 

Balance.)


Monks and Priests of the Blackorder seek to dominate others, both those within 

their order and those without. Members have no interest in persons whom they 

cannot dominate or exploit. And anyone who poses a threat to a member should 

watch his back. Because they are unrestrained by ethics, members of the 

Blackorder would as soon slit a man's throat as smell a rose if they had 

anything to gain from it. But these men/women are evil, not stupid. They do not 

go around destroying everything they see. Such actions lead to vigilantism and 

lynching. On the other hand, cunning schemes lead to power, riches, and the 

admiration of the gods of Evil.

 

The Blackorder is led by the Nightmaster, who is assisted by one Shadowcaster. 

*Be it known though that if the Nightmaster of the Blackorder makes a decree, 

blatant and intentional breaking of that decree may result in being ousted from 

the clan and branded a Heathen.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Heathens:

Are evil priests and monks who refuse to acknowledge and worship an established 

evil god/goddess of Krynn, or when a Blackorder member defies the wishes of 

their faith or ignore set decrees made by the Nightmaster. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

 

There is a set list of common duties and possessions a monk or priest of our

order wears, weilds, carries, etc, and I'll be getting them out to you guys

shortly. My hope in this is to better help mold your character here in the 

blackorder and give you a good understanding of our inner workings so that

your character may flourish for the glory of the dark gods. These are

guidelines, not rules, and keep in mind to just have fun!

The old measure
Had information on formal address.
Had information on courtly etiquette.
Had seventy-five pages about how to proper saddle a horse.
Had strict steps for rising through the ranks in the knighthood.
Gave the Kingfisher a place of honor in the knighthood.
Spoke against hindering another knight when they are performing their duties, even one of lesser rank.
Said that on detached duty that regardless of rank the knight that has the most knowledge of the area has command until their superior has equaled their knowledge.
Said that justice be sought in peace before using the sword.
Said: "In war, the spirit weighs three times heavily as the body."
Said no knight should purposely insult another knight.
Said a state of low spirits is dishonorable and should be dealt with quickly.
Prohibited women from touching the sword of a true knight.
Said: "Any man who returns a blow must stay the course of battle."
Said a knight should support a superior in word and deed. Also, that it was inexcusable to refuse an order from a superior.
Stated knights cannot disguise their identity. It also stated that fulfillment of a quest of honor sanctioned by the Council can take precedence over the requirement of stating where their allegiances lie.
Stated that a knight should not kill an opponent unawares.
Stated to know thy enemy.
Stated that a leader never shouts, never loses temper, never wavers or doubts, and never shows fear.
Stated that in time of war all personal grievances must be put aside and contests of honor are forbidden.
Stated that a knight could not depart on a long journey without receiving sanction from their superior.
Stated that a knight cannot retreat from battle no matter what the cost.
Stated that a squire must go through the Night of Reflections when they are about to become a knight. That they must spend time "in watching and in long thought, from sunset again unto sunset, for even the light of day is dark when the memory ranges."
Stated to not take life needlessly and to fight only in defense.
Stated that enslavement is forbidden. Vinas Solamnus declared this.
Stated that the knighthood is made up of circles. A circle is in every city and town that knights openly reside in.
Stated the rules for forming the Grand Circle of the Knighthood to elect a new Grand Master including that seventy percent of all the circles must send two knights for the election.
Stated that the High Clerist must be from the Order of Clerists.
The end of the 35th volume and the first 70 pages of the 36th volume contain the rules for the Barriers of Sword that occurs during the Midsummer Tournament among others.
According to volume 2 page 37, article 2, subarticle 2, when the council is undecided in the Measure of Tournaments judgment goes to the Scholars of the Measure.
According to volume 16 page 22, article 3, A knight must accept any challenge of combat to defend the honor of the Orders.
According to volume 16 page 45, article 1, that trial by combat is the preferable recourse for matters between individual knights.
The Measure spoke of faith, but did not mention the gods or any god by name. This led some knights before the War of the Lance to believe this meant to have faith in oneself. Sir Adrian Montgomery wrote about this perspective of the Measure. The Measure also speaks of how knights would use prayers to heal the wounded in battle. It is unknown how Montgomery rationalized this.
Had ritual words that a Grand Master says to a High Commander when they leave for battle.
Said a type of meeting like the Whitestone Council requires witnesses.
After a few generations of being written, entries to the Measure were added discouraging the use of arcane magic by any knight.
Originally the Measure did not stipulate that a knight had to be Noble or Human. About 300 hundred years after it was first written the Grand Master at the time added to the Measure that only Solamnic humans could become knights. This was later changed after the War of the Lance.
The Measure did not stipulate between an honorary knight and a true knight.

 The house of Soth was one of the ruling houses of Solamnia since the nation's founding.
Lord Soth was a tall and heavy-boned man, with a square jaw,
 prominent brow and high cheekbones, with deep-set and piercing steel-gray eyes and thick, pitch black hair
 with a shock hanging down over his shoulders in curls. He also had the traditional Solamnic mustache that was stylishly long and tapered.
Soth began his career as a squire in the service of Holger Windsound around the Tenthmonth of 40 PC. He went on many adventures, battling creatures of evil and killing them in the name of the Knights of Solamnia. Soth became a formidable fighter as a Knight of the Sword, but had to prove himself in order to become a Knight of the Rose.
He led a mission into the southern part of the Empire of Ergoth to rescue two knights who had been captured by ogres. Soth successfully rescued the two knights, one of which was Sir Degan Kurrold. Lord Soth also escorted religious pilgrims to Istar to pray in the Temple of the Kingpriest, but the caravan was attacked by bandits while en route to the city. Soth killed four ogres and a minotaur himself, and he prevented the injury of all those in the caravan.

In the spring of 5 PC, Soth saved a small boy from a burning cottage while traveling to Throtyl through the Kelwick Pass.
 He brought the boy back to get healing at Dargaard Keep, which saved his life. For his final deed of honor to attain the rank of Rose Knight, Soth successfully defended Lady Wandra's
 honor when a former suitor cast doubt on her chastity. As a result of these deeds, Lord Soth was elevated to the rank of Knight of the Rose in Fierswelt, 4 PC.
Lord Soth married Korinne Gladria, a lady from Palanthas, just outside of Dargaard Keep, later that same month.
 The marriage went well initially; Soth ruled over Knightlund and attempted to settle down,
 but began to long for the spirit of adventure he felt while out on the road, rather than ruling over a peaceful province from his Keep.
The following year, in Holmswelt, Lord Soth was traveling with his loyal knights to Palanthas
 to join in the annual meeting of the Knights of Solamnia. En route, the Knights came upon a party of Silvanesti Elves
 who were being attacked by ogres. Soth and his knights slaughtered the ogres and saved the elven party. However, when Soth laid eyes on an elfmaiden by the name of Isolde Denissa,
 he was instantly smitten. He took her back to Dargaard Keep so that his loyal healer, Istvan, could care for her injuries.

Fall of a Rose
By the month of Fleurgreen, Lord Soth began cheating on his wife with Isolde. Even when his wife,
 Korinne, became pregnant through magical means, Soth continued the affair. Matters became more
 complicated when Isolde became pregnant only a month before Soth and Korinne's child was to be born.
 When his first son was born in the month of Fleurgreen in 2 PC, it was deformed by the magic. Blaming his wife for his son's appearance, Soth murdered both his wife and newborn son,
 and maintained that she had died in childbirth. After the appropriate six-month mourning period, he was married to Isolde in the middle of Darkember in 2 PC, with Isolde visibly pregnant to the few that attended the ceremony.
The following year in the month of Newkolt, Isolde gave birth to a baby boy, who was named after Soth's
 great-great-grandfather, Peradur Soth. One month later, Soth was summoned to Palanthas by the High Justice,
 where a panel of Knights charged and found him guilty of the murder of his first wife thanks to the testimony of Soth's healer,
 Istvan. Sentenced to death, he was rescued from public beheading by a group of his knights, and fled to Dargaard Keep. Not wanting to attack the fortress, the Solamnics banished Soth to Knightlund.
Confined to his realm, lest he risk death at the hands of the Knights if captured outside of his lands,
 Soth fell into a deep depression. Concerned about her husband's welfare, Isolde prayed to Mishakal to save her husband.
 The goddess charged her to tell Soth to travel to Istar to prevent the Kingpriest from calling down the gods' wrath in the Cataclysm.
 Furthermore, if killed in the attempt to stop the Kingpriest, Paladine and Mishakal would raise him from the dead to allow him to succeed in his quest, and although he would be killed in the attempt, could die peacefully, with full honor.

Death of a Rose
After contemplating Mishakal's message, Soth agreed to the quest. With three of his most loyal knights, Wersten Kern, Caradoc,
 and Colm Farold, as escorts, Soth set off for Istar to stop the Kingpriest. However, while on the road he encountered the same
 group of elves that had been traveling with Isolde years before. The elven maidens told Soth that Isolde had been unfaithful and that her child wasn't his. Enraged
 Soth killed the elves (who were phantoms), and rode back to Dargaard Keep with murder in his heart.
Upon returning to the keep, Soth found Isolde holding their newborn son,
 and confronted her with the lies whispered into his ear. While they argued in the great hall,
 the Cataclysm that Soth was sent to stop struck Krynn, causing a chandelier to fall from the ceiling,
 crushing Isolde and Peradur. Trapped and dying underneath the chandelier, the elfmaiden tried to give Soth his son, but the proud knight refused, condemning them both to death. Calling down a terrible curse on Soth, Isolde declared that he will "live one life for every life" as a result of the Cataclysm.

Lord Soth died in the flames of Dargaard Keep, whose fire was so fierce even the stones burned.
 However, Isolde's curse was heard by the gods, and when Soth awoke he found that his flesh was burned and the pain was strong as he moved,
 his skin breaking off in pieces with each step. In no time at all, however, his flesh was gone and he was nothing more than a skeleton covered in black armor,
 with eyes that burned a bright orange flame and he was in constant pain.
His most loyal followers Caradoc, Colm Farold, Darin Valcic, Derik Grimscribe, Kris Krejlgaard, Meyer Seril, Wersten Kern, and Zander Vingus,
 were also killed in the Cataclysm. Like Soth, however, these Knights of Solamnia did not die; instead, they were condemned to serve Lord Soth in the afterlife as his skeletal warriors. Furthermore, the three elf maidens
 who poisoned Soth's mind with lies were sent back as banshees to remind him every night of the destruction that he had allowed to happen.

War of the Lance
During the War of the Lance, Lord Soth pledged his allegiance to a Dragon Highlord, Kitiara Uth Matar.
 He allowed Kitiara to stay in Dargaard Keep and to make it one of her bases of operation. Following
 the fall of Kalaman to Whitestone Forces, Soth assisted in the kidnap of Laurana for Kitiara to be used as a pawn for the Dark Queen. In return for his part in the plot,
 he was promised Laurana's soul following the meeting with the Dark Queen, but in the confusion during the collapse of the Temple of Neraka, Laurana and Tanis Half-Elven managed to escape Soth's clutches.
 With the Golden General out of the picture, Soth assisted Kitiara in the assassination of the remaining highlords, allowing Kitiara full control over the remaining Dragonarmies.

The Blue Lady's War
Prior to the outbreak of the Blue Lady's War, Soth was sent by Kitiara to assassinate Crysania of Tarinius, so that Kitiara might thwart her half-brother Raistlin Majere's plans to enter the Abyss and become a god.
 However, although Soth spoke the command, "die," Crysania was saved by the intercession of Paladine and fell instead into a deep coma. Soth, however, did not realize this, and reported to Kitiara that his mission was successful.
In the days and weeks following, Kitiara prepared her troops for an assault on Palanthas that would coincide with Raistlin's re-entry into Krynn from the Abyss.
 As part of the assault force, Soth led the banshee elves and skeletal warriors against the gates of Palanthas to assist Kitiara's aerial assault on the city and to exact revenge on the city's citizens for condemning him to death centuries before.
Soth and his minions tore into the city, killing everything in their path until he arrived at the Tower of High Sorcery in Palanthas to find Kitiara dying from a dagger thrown by Dalamar the Dark.
 Prevented from taking Kitiara's soul for his own until she was released by Tanis Half-Elven, Soth succeeded in carrying off the body of the only woman he considered his equal after years of burning jealousy for all her lovers.

War of Souls
During the War of Souls, the prophet of the One God, Mina, came to Lord Soth, who had been trapped in Nightlund by Takhisis.
 On behalf of the One God, Mina offered Lord Soth the command of her undead armies. However, Soth refused Mina's entreaties, finally having had time to reflect on his deeds and accepting responsibility and regret for his conduct. Infuriated by his refusal, Takhisis destroyed the magic holding the Lord of the Black Rose together, ending Soth's tortured existence.
Powers and Followers
Lord Soth has the ability to kill living things by pointing at the object and uttering the command word, "die." In addition,
 Soth's touch is lethal. He and his thirteen skeletal warriors ride Nightmares, while banshees carry swords of ice and ride in chariots pulled by wyverns.

Things that couldn't have just been dropped.. or left behind.  Something
telling about them is there, but what that might be, was not known.

to each of you.
 
However, this day would be different.  Each of them would glow a violate
hue, humming a sweet sound.  To look on them or to observe their strange
development is to mean one thing... a thought in your mind.  A thought
that there are others out there.  A thought that these things are important.
A thought that the others have been found... and a thought that you need
to find whom has found them.  Simply, the thought to meet, and understand

It has come to my attention that you have been selected as the bearer of a curious item; a key. The Heavens speak to me, they speak tale of a chamber located deep within the Garnet Mountains, a chamber that can only be reached once these keys are united. Within it I am told there are treasures that abound; a gift for us to take upon our success in finding it. 
 
It has also come to my attention that within this chamber there are spirits. But fear not, for they simply seek freedom. Upon our venturing there, I will be able to release them, to set them free to the heavens where they may rest peacefully forevermore, and where we may reap the benefits of what's left behind in their wake. I advise that you seek me out within the Last Call upon the date inscribed below, and together we may all be eternally rich.

{rDear brothers and sisters of the Conclave,
Most of you know me by now and if you do not that is a shame. We are all bound together by the one thing we hold sacred Magic. We joined this Brotherhood to advance our different schools of the arcane, and to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. In the past, we did an incredible job of doing so, but now, it seems without proper direction we have slacked in this. We have slacked so much so that there are renegades that would challenge us in our own towers.
Magic is a gift from the three divine, and it is our gift, not the worlds. From here on any practicing outside of our three circles will be brought to justice, be it by convincing them to join, locking them in the dungeons, or death. For too long we have let magic run rampant, and now it ends. We have the largest collection of Arcane text the world knows, use it, grow in knowledge, become the great sorceres, and sorceress some of you are destined to be.
I encourage you to stay in the towers if you are not of at least the teaching rank, for there are renegades that attack us on sight. If you are about and one does such a thing, inform your ordermaster, myself, or any of the Archwizards.
I wish you all the best in your search for knowledge,
Yerthorn Stormspell{x

I'm still active, but on top of not been playing recently, I now have very little time. I'd really like to jump on and play some more but I'll be lacking time.
 
I noticed some activity a few weeks ago and been trying to catch somebody on with no luck. I'll try to catch you on sometime. 
 
Also, I've been doing a bit of thinking about reforming my character and how I roleplay her. For now, you can view Rylinthai as such;
Former Leader
Bad Attitude
Follower of Zeboim
Information Gatherer
Elven
 
Other than that, which you probably wouldn't know some of that in character anyways, I might change.

I absolutely need a mage of any background to be a key component, just show up or let me know.

My mind quickly races with the fears and dreams many ventured to utter
these long years past.  There has been little sleep for me as I have grown
increasingly aware of my gift passed on by other Silvanesti.  The Burden to
one day care for the Speaker of the Stars.  
 
Many would consider that such a blessing, but I have seen those past and
how little blessings they recieved. My fight has been to accept what is
to come and pass, not to reject what my people hold to be truth, and yet
I do. 
 
My soul is torn from the true ways of the Silvanesti and here I now find
comfort in the arms of you, Lunitari. The wisdom of what is replaces the
forced thoughts of what should be. My devotion is to the betterment of
others through my tireless work in the tower discovering, and still
hiding from what could be. I must have a new purpose or I am doomed to
walk the path other broken souls have fallen from.

It's come to my attention that the newest Immortals (Morgion and Lunitari) are going wizinvis while they go afk, to wrack up hours. Morgion has been wizinvis in the Rose Garden for the past 5, and not responded to any tells. Or else they go afk and are gone for hours. I don't feel like it's fair to those of us Immortals who actually do play our hours, nor to the players, who need active immortals, and not ones that prove Aurolite's point.

Grandmaster,
 
My vote for High Warrior is as follows. I believe that Oroszlan is the best qualified Knight of the Crown to join the Council - he has demonstrated a knowledge of the Code, a level head in the face of adversaries, and is intelligent enough to handle criticism.
 
Also with this vote, I recommend the squire Marcus Meridian to be put before the council and reviewed for Knighthood. He has handled situations far beyond his calling and demonstrates an understanding of what it means to be a knight.
 
That is all. May the Light grace your paths and illuminate the darkness.

My name is Davlamin Crysindale, I'm a young mage that has been traveling around from my small town. I have come acros a few things in my travel and learned what little magic I could manage. I was informed of this group from a very nice elven man in white robes. I believe I need this group, I wish to further my own skills with magic so that I may share it with the world.
 
I would appreciate it if someone could get back to me as soon as possible, I think this could be a vital choice for my future. I'm not much of a writer so I look forward to an actual face to face encounter with you, until that moment may our minds stay strong and our magic serve well.

Council, Fellow Knights, and Friends,
 
I write to you today to petition for increased guards. I have word that the Undead plan to attack Palanthas soon, and will do so from the north and the east. I would like to increase the sentries at all gates, as well as station a militia at the High Clerists Tower.
 
It may also be prudent to conserve food and supplies, in preparation for a time of siege. If we can maintain a militia at the High Clerist's tower, who can ensure this road will be safe, then I believe the DiCaela castle will serve well for such stores.
 
The Templar Muira has called for allies to the Holy Order's cause in preventing this Court from achieving it's mission of terror. I feel it is our duty to answer their call, and ask for the Council's permission to do so.
 
May the Light grace your paths and illuminate the Darkness,

Lords and Ladies,

of a one Sir Chidak, that had been charged with assault.  Sir Chidak had informed
me when I went to speak with him that he had been charged with an unjustified
charge.  On normal circumstances, I could only provide council to the man, but can
not lift a charge from him.  However, when I went to go and look for the paperwork
and files on his charge... lo and behold, there were none!
 
Lords and Ladies, in honest opinion that is sloppy work and lazy.  I cannot arrest
someone for a charge, of which I have no idea what in the world he had done!  That
is especially when he claims the charge is false!  Against the wishes of records
administration, and in a small debacle, I have removed the charge of assault from
Sir Chidak.  As I had to -clearly- state to records administration, inquires that
I am sure to come, should come to me.

If it is a first time offense, it is up to your discretion. The charge against Chidak will not be reinstated unless the Knight who charged him comes forward. What is done is done until we can determine fault.

A temporary alliance has been made with those of Destruction; particularly anyone within the ranks of The Mercenaries. Their creed is a worthy one to manipulate, and to have them as an extension of our already existing power, without needing the usual required coin, is an invaluable asset at the current point in time. 
 
They have sworn their protection to us, should we require it at any time, so be certain to take full advantage of this. Anyone who negatively effects this alliance shall be swiftly dealt with, so be certain you know the station of your victim before you end their life.

Brothers and sisters, i come with bad news. One of our own, Linx, has gone against many of our beliefs in his recent actions. Not only had he proclaimed a mark of devotion to our mother means 'nothing', but he had also assaulted a fellow forester and made implied threats. I will include a small description of the events that took place, and hope that i was not in the wrong in my actions.
 
OOC: Summary of events tells you:
*Linx summons and serenades a Unicorn of Chislev*
You say 'Trickery, there is no followers of chislev around to summon the unicorn!'
You say 'Die, false servant of the beast!'
*kills the unicorn*
Linx yells 'MY UNICORN!!!'
Linx sweetly sings a soft lullaby. (puts anavrin to sleep - 10 tics)
The music captivates your mind, putting you in a temporary paralysis. (paralyz 2 tics)
(wake finally)
You say 'Brother! You have no reason to assault me!'
Linx warbles 'You assaulted a creature of nature.'
You say 'It is not. A true steed of the Beast serves its rightful owners. You can not simply summon one from somewhere else.'
You say 'Even if you had pulled one away from a deserving follower of Chislev, you dont deserve to call it yours, brother. You have not earned that right.'
Linx warbles 'Just because you think you are better than me simply because of the mark you were means nothing, half breed.'
You say 'For one, do not make such insults to those you work beside. Next, i did not say i was better than you, simply stating a fact that a true steed of the Beast is earned by her will, not your own. If you are a real forester, you will honor that.'
Linx warbles 'What exactly are you going to do about it Anavrin?'
Anavrin nods, 'Obviously there was a mistake in your admitance. Im sure you will hear about it soon, good day.'
(clan)The message is from Linx, and it reads: Anavrin, Let's see what Aorac wil say after I tell him about what you did to one of the majestic creatures.

Because I'm no exception, and am perhaps the worst.
You didn't offend me at all, but I do have a lot to be ashamed of.

The black crow drops the cloth, letting it descend from dark night sky, coming to a stop on a branch that hangs from the dead tree outside the cavern entrance. The demonic knight looks up, grabbing the cloth as it dangles in the harsh wind of the Dargaard Trail.  He reads, scribbled in blood:

'' Followers of the Dron of the {YDeep{x. The legendary Lady {rKalaela{x Yancy visited my cell on this hour, bringing with her that legendary sarcasm and wit.

{gGreetings knights of Solamnia, 
First and foremost I would like to give you my name, Elrick Erthmire, and the reason why I bother you with my letter. I wish to find a patron knight among your ranks so that I one day could become a knight of solamnia myself.
I know that this is not something that will take days, or weeks even but I am willing to give the rest of my life to the causes of honor and justice. I come from a small farm in the woods west of palanthas where my father taught me as well as he could of manners and such.
I know not to strike a lady, visit temple no less than twice a week, and to help those less off than myself. I wish merely to help bring peace and justice to the lands I call home.
Sincerely, 
Elrick Erthmire{x

<Yerthorn> The light continues to fade, and the chill grows into a freezing cold. No wind moves, all is still and silent. If you were to hold your hand but inches from your face it would not be able to be seen. Off in the distance to your left, a small scratching sound can be heard, growing ever so lightly as the minutes pass.

{MEnchantment is the Arcane clssification of being able to cast spells onto youself, another, or peices of equiptment that add 
The basics of enchantment work by taking a person or object and casting certain spells on them to change how they look, how strong they are, how fast their body moves, or how their body moved, giving them the ability to act with things as they were not once able. 
Even being able to help them take of foes that they were unable to before! When it comes to enchanting equipment on the other hand it adds an extra protection or added attributes to items, these enchantments are most often permutate unlike the counterpart to casting enchantment on a person, although casting a enchantment on a person tends to have more befits.

Title: Judas Priest - Prophecy lyrics
Visitors: 837 visitors have hited Prophecy Lyrics since June 03, 2010.
I am the darkness
I am the force
That burns here
Tonight
Bringing the future
To all mankind
Guider of life
Of death
The dight
Of the blind
Your future lies
Within my eyes
What I predict
Will terrify
I can't control
What comes to be
From the past
To the present
To eternity
I am Nostradamus
Do you you believe
I am Nostradamus
That I conceive
Master of chaos
Anger and rage
I hold the key
My presence
Will unlock the cage
I am your witness
The one who can tell
Bearing the sword
The shield
To your heaven
Ffrom hell
As I unfold
The mystery
I change
The course
Of history
With premonitions
From the void
Will you live
Will you die
Will your worlds
Collide
I am Nostradamus
The hand of fate
I am Nostradamus
With love and hate
Lost in this vortex
The mystery begins
Will you be victim
Saved from your sins
Time is illusion
Trapped in the skies
Destiny's calling
Hear from my eyes
Many years ago
A boy was born
A boy with a gift
A gift that would be
The envy
Of all mankind
To see
What no other could
Great visions
Of the future
Or would a curse
Be bestowed on the boy
The boy whose name
Was Nostradamus
Damus, damus
Damus, damus, damus
I am Nostradamus
Do not forsake
I am Nostradamus
Your life's at stake
I am Nostradamus
The lightning rod
I am Nostradamus
The voice of God
Celestial comets
Reign towards earth
Alchemy's tempest
Predicting your worth
Pray for deliverence
Escape if you can
For I have borne witness
To the purging of man

A small leather book somewhat protrudes from a small cubby within the walls of the forester clan hall. Picking it up, it seems well made, and well used. A name is written on the inside cover, Anavrin Xanadu, but many of the pages seem to be random facts, reciting discoveries, mundane happenings, and the like. Flipping further you stop on a random page and read;

OOC: okay, this will be the first of a series of entries on me working on switching over to Thief class, with reasoning. If i can not recieve a class change i will most likely be re-making anavrin but carrying over all his roleplays and such. If the evolution and reasoning doesnt interest you, feel free to ignore these entries.

Meditating upon life in general, i found myself worrying for this world of ours, rightfully cut off from those who have lost their way. As i began to worry, a wolfs howl could be heard in the distance. Partially thanks to us, that iconic animal runs free, living life as it should. Without fear of restraint or undeserved punishments from the cruel world outside the forests.
{/
It goes without saying that nature is an icon of pure free will and freedom from any burdens that may weigh down upon others. Rejoice in this freedom and embrace it. The Foresters will defend your right to do so, and with the Beast by our side, you can rest easy. 
 
Contact me if your ever in need, brothers and sisters.

{rGreetings Brothers and Sisters, 
For too long have we been idle, myself included. This is time for a change, And here are how we are starting these changes.
1. Find one to lead the black. 
For to long, they have gone without guidance. One of you need to step up and prove your worth to the Nightreaver.
2. Renegades are still very alive.
We will start with the memembers of the thorn. Then to any whom use magic without the blessings of one of the Three. If you see magic being used recklessly, feel free to stop its use. By any means.
3. Those whom are still alive, or not missing need to send a letter to me personaly.
4. Any mage at or above the rank of teacher shall need an apprentice.
This is to help the newer generations control their magick.
5. Work Together within the towers.
Outside we may fight, but never again will there be discord within the towers. Everything will be settled in the dueling chambers, or outside the halls.
This is all, protect magic and keep its secrests safe.

You're experiencing that problem do to a command called 'BRIEF'.

Just type BRIEF and everything will be back to normal.

Ivan,
 
There has been much discussion about this particular trait. The reasoning behind it is that you're so devoted to your god, he specially marked you. Because your devotion is so great, others are allowed to see it, and how it has changed you.
 
While I, personally, think it would be better for rp, especially for followers of gods such as Hiddukel, and the other evil gods, Hiddukel trumps me.

Hello Xendralix, Anavrin, and any other Foresters reading this note! My name is Silvaria, 
and I am a Kagonesti thief. I am interested in becoming a devoted member of the Foresters,
and have vowed to the glorious Lady Chislev. She has welcomed me to the clan, however, I wanted 
to take a moment to introduce myself and ask for your blessing and approval. I was a slave in a 
large Qualinesti home for many years, and escaped only by luck and chance. My past is one of pain 
and tears, and I dislike thinking about it -- although mention of the subject will cause me much
distress and anger. This I wish you to know, most of all. Secondly, a certain necromancer has taken
much interest in my wellbeing. He is quite insane, and I have no idea what his motives may be, other 
than amusement. I have no other dealings with him. His name is Darkahn Kiralv.
I look forward to meeting you in person soon! Please let me know if there are any problems or 
concerns you may have!

Ok Here's my thought Sence I'm not on a lot this sorta my thought on things.  Ok Rp Idea is for us to attack the mages while they are in disorder of sorts. Not like destroy or any thing just annoy a bit. And possible have some one steal the secrets they hide for our own use.  I repeat..OUR use. Though those who grab any thing gets first choice. I'll be back on next month again as per normal when I get my daughter.

To: Hiddukel Majere

This note is informal, and an inquery at best.  It has been some time

since I was a regular on LoK, and I've long lost track of the number of

hours I spent here.  Now it seems I have more time to myself, and the

playerbase (the reason I originally deleted my character Quinlin Olorien, a

brash move in response to what I felt was an overwhelming number of immature

players) seems to have calmed down.  My question is: is it possible to

restore that character?  I haven't even a clue if there's a limit on how

long a character has been deleted before it can be revived, but if it is at

all possible, I would be more than grateful.  If there are any stipulations

that would accompany it (name change, loss of hero status, etc.)  I would be

willing to accept it.  I do want to bring this character back, however I do

not wish to restart his journey at level 1.  If this is not possible, that's

fine as well.  Thank you for your consideration.

To: Hiddukel
Hiddukel, I've spoken off and on with a couple of the Immortal staff
concerning a possible return of Quinlin, and if it was worth my trying to
lobby for his return.  When I deleted the character, it was indeed a brash
and poorly-thought decision, but at the time I thought it better to remove
myself completely rather than continue to watch what I thought to be a
decline in both my play, and the players with whom I interacted.  Having
stepped away from Legends of Krynn for some time now, and reminiscing about
the thousands of hours I've spent immersing myself within what it has to
offer, I thought I would very humbly ask if it was possible to have him
returned.  While it saddens me that I no longer see the old faces I'd become
accustomed to, I do take some pride in being a player that -is- one of those
older faces, and I think that Quinlin still has a lot to offer to this MUD. 
I thank you for your consideration, and await an answer at your convenience.
 
Sincerely,
Zane (Quinlin/Dhimas)

There seems to be a scroll hanging within the forester clan hall, open for all to read.
{x.-.------------------------------------------------------------------------.-.

  |  |                                                                    |  |
  |  |               Dear Brothers and Sisters of the forest              |  |
  |  |        Our beloved Mother has blessed me with the opportunity      |  |
  |  |                   To guide us in Aorac's leave.                    |  |
  |  |                                                                    |  |
  |  |       Even with this new found position, I am no more vital        |  |
  |  |              Than each and every Brother and Sister.               |  |
  |  |       Our selflessness will remain a key difference between us     |  |
  |  |          And the less civilized inhabitants of the city            |  |
  |  |                                                                    |  |
  |  |       They have lost their way, and have become cut off from       |  |
  |  |       The beauty of Nature, and its sweet embrace of Freedom.      |  |
  |  |                                                                    |  |
  |  |          It is for this reason that I believe we should            |  |
  |  |         Take our words to those who have been consumed by          |  |
  |  |    The spoils and corrupted life within their own prison of stone. |  |
  |  |                                                                    |  |
  |  |          Go forth and recruite, bless the forests with fresh       |  |
  |  |             bodies to keep warm, and souls to keep free.           |  |

  |  |             Find your mates, your shelter, and your self.          |  |
  |  |           For this is destines to be a rough road to travel.       |  |
  |  |                        But a necessary one.                        |  |

Out in the open, near the same cubby of the forester clan hall, lies the same small book. Curiousity intrigues you to read, though only to find the owner's name. Flipping to a random page, you read:

OOC: okay, this will be the first of a series of entries on me working on switching over to Thief class, with reasoning. If i can not recieve a class change i will most likely be re-making anavrin but carrying over all his roleplays and such. If the evolution and reasoning doesnt interest you, feel free to ignore these entries.

You continue to read, when you see no one is around, Wanting to know what has become of the new found leader of the Foresters. The next page reads:

OOC: ok thsi is the next step, putting awya the bow and starting to try out different thieving things. i decided there will be 1 or 2 journal entries a day, and they will all be removed after the switch is permanent, whichever way that comes to be.

Meditating upon life in general, i found myself worrying for this world of ours, rightfully cut off from those who have lost their way. As i began to worry, a wolfs howl could be heard in the distance. Partially thanks to us, that iconic animal runs free, living life as it should. Without fear of restraint or undeserved punishments from the cruel world outside the forests.
{/
It goes without saying that nature is an icon of pure free will and freedom from any burdens that may weigh down upon others. Rejoice in this freedom and embrace it. The Foresters will defend your right to do so, and with the Beast by our side, you can rest easy. 
 
Contact me if your ever in need, brothers and sisters.
- Gladeward Anavrin Xanadu.

I think it should be tailored to how they roleplay. Some filchers could roleplay with a bigger focus on their magic, whereas others could focus on the rogue part more.

cannot afford to be -too- picky.  It is not unprecedented.  Spellfilchers
have, sparingly, been allowed in the past.  Battlemages remain prohibited,

The Dragon's Claw is a holy artifact belonging to Chemosh. It is a dragon-clawed bracelet with a large emerald embedded in it, that when worn would be above the wearer's wrist. It has the ability to raise people and creatures from the dead, including even a bone dragon. When someone puts it on his or her hand, it embeds the emerald above the wrist, and the entire hand has all its flesh removed leaving a skeletal hand. This does not hinder the person who wears the bracelet.

Hey Craig,
{/{/Today, I logged on and used my "GOTO" command to visit Zivilyn. He and I talked a bit, and did the usual messing around. Sirrion then logged on, and Zivilyn playfully transfered Chislev to his room and said "Everyone is in my room now". I used the redit command and hit enter to open a list of all the people/mobs in the room.
{/ It show'd Me, Zivilyn, Sirrion, and Chislev were in the room. I used the "IMMTALK" channel to address Chislev, and she never answered. So, i even used the "IMMTALK" to ask if she was just afking hours, and still got no reply. I logged off, and Sirrion texted me some hours later saying that she had just then answered, then logged off.
I just wanted to bring it to your attention that I believe she may be AFKing all of her hours, which I was told by higher ups isn't really smiled upon. I know hours are kind of meaningless, but I figured you'd wanna know.

As a forewarning, I don't usually plan stuff like this out in advance, I

Tybalt became fast friends with several Kagonesti, which led him to learn
the Kagonesti language.  The gift of magic made itself apparent to Tybalt at
a relatively young age and it soon consumed his whole life.  Magic
fascinated Tybalt, and he spent every waking moment learning about it and
reading up on it.  His parents tolerated his studies but being outside of
the nobility meant that he had to study on his own with no tutorship or
special help.  Though bookish in nature, his parents forced him to at least
socialize with some of their business contacts forcing him to develop a
friendly personality alongside his magical knowledge.  Though all aspects of
magic, even necromancy, held some interest to Tybalt, Evocation came easier
than any other school of magic.  His friendship with the Kagonesti, and the
general treatment of them by the rest of Qualanesti society left a bitter
taste in his mouth and made him vow to never use magic to control others. 
He left Qualinost to travel the world before he took the test, knowing that
his true love is magic, he wanted to see the world one time without concern
before he finally joined the conclave.

The eyes of a cougar lock onto an antelope in the distance. Waiting for an opportunity, the predator leaps onto the preys back, tackling it to the ground. Using her long claws to cripple the preys' knees, she quickly lunges and sinks her teeth into the antelopes neck and throat, strangling it to death. The cougar lets of a breath of air between a sigh and a cough. The grass
 surrounding her feet take hold as she bows her head, growing and twisting around her leg as the cougar seemingly melds into the land. Moments later, a hand lunges out of the ground, followed by the body of a healthy young druid by the name of Nidalee. Long brown hair flows from her head, kept out of the way with a tie in the back. Her body marked with light white stripes, much
 like her animalistic forms, and she wears not only the hide nad fur of her prey, but also a belt of trophies such as tusks or large teeth. Her head remains bowed as before the transformation as she gives thanks to the Beast for the successful hunt before she takes the carcass away to cook.
 
Beside a bondfire, the young druid sits pleased with her meal. Noise in the distance is heard and causes her ears to peak. Quickly making her way through the forest, sinking into the earth, reappearing closer and closer to the noise, she finally comes to it. Hidden in the branches of
 a tall oak, she watches as human hunters are on the ground below her. Traps sprung, a healthy rabbit caught by the leg as the men celebrate. "{gYou call this civilized?{x" the druid speaks to herself while watching. One of the men come closer to the trap, but is quickly stopped by a spear thrown by Nidalee, landing at the mans feet.
 
"Hey young thing, why don't you come down here and keep us company?" the man asks, chuckling with the others as they gaze upon her. With a smirk the young druid gracefully lands on the ground, her brown eyes locked and her hand steady, she takes the spear out of the ground as
 the man backs away. "You have some nerve," he says. Without looking away, Nidalee explains "{gThe untamed know no fear. Leave before I ruin my meal with the taste of cowards.{x" After a short stare down, the men leave. Nidalee turns to the captures hare, releasing it but realizing
 its leg is broken. "{gNot today, little hare, not to these disrespectful 'hunters'.{x" she adds, placing a hand on it and heals its wound. As it hobbles away, you see that it is joined by a female and two baby rabbits aswell.
 
Sitting in a forested temple to Chislev, Nidalee asks herself and her god many things; Why do they find amusement in picking on the weak? Why can't they just take what they need instead of punishing the world with greed?  Why don't we hunt the civilized who hunt us, children of 
 nature? Determination in her eyes, her rounded pupils become more cat-like slits as she begins her transformation and leaving, stating simply "{gThey will fear the wild.{x" Leaping through 
 the forest in her cougar form, she continues to think, her thoughts projected to the beast aswell. 'Test my conviction, test my resolve. Guide me, I will be your healer and your spear.'

Subject Missive~
Text
Since birth, I had been raised amongst many other younglings as the cattle we were to serve a purpose for the
Court of Undeath.  Showing arcane potency, I was separated from the mass of mindless infants and put among
a different crowd of drones.  We were each pushed to reach out thirtieth season of arcane training before we
were ten years of age.  I was the only one to survive.
 
I learned the black arts of the Necromancer.  As the undead armies of the Court of Undeath advanced, I used
war to my advantage to steal from many sacred locations secrets of the arcane arts, to further myself and
my power.  Upon one such site I located a text called the 'Amanagrae Document,' an unholy piece of text that
depicts an old mage and the magics he used to call upon infernal beings to augment him with demonic power.
 
Unable to pursue the information located within the text, I continued to fight along with the Court of Undeath
against the northern continent of Solamnia.  The war lasted on for quite some time, until it was told that
Nomocron, the High Judge of the Court, and his other six fellow Judges that make up the head of the Court
of Undeath, were sealed away by powerful magic.  The creatures that were undead fell into the pieces that
they were, and those that were living fled.  I myself went into hiding on a small island for quite some
time.  There, I took control of the small population of tribal people on the island and convinced them that
I was their God.  There I stayed for a long while, until my magic became fairly potent.  I took my leave of
the island after drinking the souls and blood of the islanders, to finally pursue the text I have found some
years before.
 
I made my way to the lands that the text referenced, to which I will not reveal in this missive.  There, I found
a cauldron of great evil, seeming to be made of solid gold but the age and grime it gathered from over the
years depreciated its visual worth.  There were arcane rites that were demanded of me, and certain arcane
components that were required.  Namely, the text demanded that I 'feed the cauldron', so I feed the cauldron
in the blood, bodies and souls of prostitutes that I was able to trick into my clutches that they would be
paid handsomely for their services.  I continued to do this until the cauldron was brimming, evil spirits were
in plenty, and they very place itself was scarred with evil.
 
I then recited the final incantations that the scroll instructed me to.  The souls, the material in the cauldron,
and the very evil I had made, I then absorbed.  My body began to change.. mutilate.. over the night.  In the
morning, I had found that I had ripped the flesh from my head.. that my horns had curled demonically, that
demonic wings had sprouted from my back.  I have felt great evil burden me, but it is no curse.  It is...
power.  A reward -- I had later understood that someone, someway, I had pleased some ancient demonic being,
and had then been rewarded with its touch.. blessing.  I was only in my fortieth season of magic when I 
started -- I left in my eightieth season, with the magic and power I had gained.  I have remained dormant 
since that day, waiting for something to entice me.  Now, approached by these "black robes", curiosity fills
my mind, to understand your Conclave.  If perhaps there is power to gain as you say, that I want it.  That
is my only goal -- power, more then any have ever had.  Raw power.

I have been given in my own opion the gift to work such magic by Solinari. I grew up in the forest my parents where killed when I was of a young age. I grew up by survival be it any way.
I used my gift to help me join a gang of thieves and learned the art of sneaking around. I mainly stole frome those who stole out right. I never took from the innocent. I tried to stay on a fairly good path.
I'm choose to protect those who can not or are not able to protect them selves. It has been a very long and dangourse road and I would prefer not to be placed as a renagade. I wish to use my gift and skills for the tower's use.
If there is any infromation that I can leand to you that I have not stated please feel free to search me out and convers.

Dear fellow members of the Orders of High Sorcery: One of our own has

hereby call her forth to face a tribune and see what her fate should be. 
Shimai has acted outside the laws, by first taking a renegade lover instead
of trying to get him to join us.  Secondly, she attacked me in the Tower,
and wouldn't stop until I took her somewhere else to fight.  I vote that she
be evicted from the Orders.  However, that is not for me to decide.  I wish
to call a meeting of the twenty-one Wizards on the Conclave, headed by
Darkahn, to right this.

It has been sometime since I have seen or heard from you, so I am writing this. I have passed the "test" of high sorcery, and found it a joke. I am working for the queen, to destroy these ingrates from within. I only ask that if you are to see me, to treat me like one of the conclaves dogs, for I will treat you as an enemy untill I am finished.
I have no real intent on staying here, my loyalty is, and forever will be, to the Queen. If this letter is to fall into the hands of anyone in the conclave I am sure to be killed most swiftly, I would rather that not happen.

I write to you seeking a meeting of truce to discuss a Thorn Knight of yours for my own personal reasons. Were it not for the delicacy of the matter, I would be appeased with couriers, but I am afraid that it is not something I wish to be intercepted.
 
At your agreement, I will be setting up a meeting for us in the neutral ground of Kalaman. I plan on a retainer of two men accompanying me, and would ask that you keep the same. I look forward to your response. 
 
-Lady Kalaela Yancy, High Justice

"{DLady Kalaela,
 
I will entertain your request, as you have mine in the past. I will arrive by ship at Kalaman;
I too will allow only two men -- however, they will be no mere sentries. You must excuse me,
dangers lurk in the shadows, and I cannot afford to not have an adequate squad.
 
I will be leaving at once.{x"

A small, white bird flutters about, a piece of carefully folded parchment held within
the tiny claws of its feet. It calms as it spies you, and allows for you to remove
the parchment from its claws. The writing is obviously elvish, though it is a strange mix between
script and print. The words begin steady and practiced, but as the note continues, they
descend into hurried, excited scribbling.

{y
Lady Narcissa,
 
He said yes! We can hold our ball in the ballroom here at Kalaman! I admit
he was reluctant at first... At least he seemed to be... And we'll have to tell
our guests to only invite people they know! He said he was mainly worried
about the safety of hosting something like this...
 
I've started trying to find musicians around the castle! I don't feel comfortable
wandering the streets, but the staff here has been most helpful! They seem to be
happy to run errands for me... almost too happy... and they ask me over and over if
everything pleases me... Its too much, sometimes...
 
I'm sorry, I've rewritten this for the third time now, and I keep getting distracted.
The good news is we can do it! And now we just have to plan and invite! Would you come
see me soon? If... the Towermaster makes you uncomfortable... I can let him know that
I need some time to myself?
 
Talk to you soon, I hope!

Heya, would we also be able to incorporate the key-phrase into the Vessik-copy?
Don't tell me what the phrase is, if you know it, that'll irritate Darkie lol.
But would that be possible?
 
Reviewing your e-mail and thinking deep about what to do... Probably put 3 temples
total in, so with the 2 existing saferooms, that will be 5.
Potions would be interesting, but so would drink containers. I need to ponder what
would make sense for a Forester temple... Being all... foresty, and stuff.
 
Also. Max rooms is 50?
 
Will talk to you soon -- I haven't quite started on the second floor yet, but
I will be!! And I'll update the first floor with the slight changes I'm making as well.
 
 
Oh, before I forget, how difficult are moving mobs to do? If there's a temple for Branchala there
I think it would be nifty to have minstrels wandering about the ground floor, singing-n-stuff.
No more than like 2 or 3 though.

Chatter is heard, growing steadily, within the forests. A message is formed from it, passing from mouth to mouth in the halls of the foresters. It spreads as a search has began through the forests, seemingly even the animal occupants pass the news to those who will listen.
 
Everyone will ask, "{gHave you heard?{x" and be answered with,  "{GOf course, who hasn't!{x" before falling into gossip. They speak of their formal leader, Anavrin. In his old age, he declared his stepping down from the position, with only few words to bide over the questions of the curious.
 
'It is simply not in my power to continue to be leader. My body has aged greatly, and will, I hope, one day soon become part of this world once more. I am proud to say that my time as leader has been an uneventful one; The toils of the outside world have left us unscathed and at peace, how could I be upset about that? Of course every leader would like to pass along some sort of lesson,
or leave a great impression to pathe the way for greater leaders to come, but not having these things is a small price to pay for this time of peace and growth here in the forests. I leave you now happy, and hopeful, and not completly empty handed. I may not be a name you remember, but I leave behind one who I believe you will - my daughter. A blessing from the beast herself,
 she was born with such great gifts and affinity for nature that I can not help but believe that she is destined to bring us more than anyone before. As much as I loved her, she was safer under others care and was raised not knowing her heritage. As I lay down in my deathbed, I ask only you go find her, tell her to mind that temper of hers, and give her the chance that I was given- your trust and love.'
 
A description is passed from one to another, scurrying around as new life is brought into the peaceful inhabitants. Questions arise, only to be swatted at by speculation; Who is this girl? What is she like? Can she really be so gifted? Where is she? What will she bring us? What will the Beast say?

Walking her hunting trails, Nidalee notices chatter around her. Animals, foresters, and even figures in hiding seems to be following her, watching her, and speaking amoung themselves. The young druid beckons out, asking for an explanation, but is angered by the silent response. A low
beastial growl escapes her lips as she throws a spear into the distance. Seemingly traveling with the wind itself, the spear whistles through the air, pushing brush on either side asunder in an impressive show of strength. Colliding and protruding from a large tree, the spear loses attention as the observers turn back to the druid, now half melded into the ground. When she dissapears completly, she reappears from the tree, stepping out onto her spear as if it was a ledge.
 
Looking up, it now apparent why she had thrown, and moved herself, to that specific spot. A lone forester stands upon a branch higher in the tree, seemingly as much afraid as he is curious. Looking into the druids eyes, he notices they are that of a cat, with a vertical slit for a pupil. Standing firm on her spear, gazing upon the frightened forester, she states, "{gExplain why I'm
 being followed. Now, before I come up there.{x" A very brief period of silence follows, broken by an echoing sound through the tree tops, a voice composed of many with the same message. 'You are she,-' they explained, 'she who was promised to us.' 
 
An obvious bewildered and creeped out look is shown on the druids face. The forester, named Simca, scales down the side of the tree, stopping near her. "{gWhat do they mean?{x" questioned the druid. 'Our leader spoke of you. Your power, age, physique, and temper.. it is undoubtably 
you,' he answered. Cat-like eyes narrow as she glares at the middle aged forester, apparent that she is still in the dark. 'He claimed you his daughter, one who will do great things for the forest- he was so confident and adament in his words that we consequintely feel the same.'
 
Scornfull eyes begin to lift as she hears the foresters words. With a bite of her lip, she states, "{gGet lost, I want nothing to do with the man- whoever he is.{x" The chatter stops, Simca even gazes awkwardly and silently, as Nidalee steps off her spear and catches it with a 
hook of the hand while falling.'But.. the Beast..' is shouted form the tree tops as the druid ventures off. Without delay, her rebutal stuns them all; "{gIf she has business with me, that is fine- I will await that day. Leave me to my hunt, before you become the prey.{x" As she leaves, it seems that the breeze follows her into the distance, swaying the grass and leafs in her direction.

Hello Hiddukel, I know it has been quite some time since I have been
around but I am back now.  Since I have been gone I have lost my other
characters, I would like to have them back if possible.  Alot of things
happened that caused me to be absent from my duties, but I am back once
again.  If I could get them back that would be great.  Thank you.

Subject Rules of the Ball!~

Following are the rules for the Ballroom event. Be sure to review them carefully,
and direct any questions to Silvaria, Narcissa, Shimai, or Chislev. We hope you
enjoy the event!
 
{C1. Please hold on to your invitation! You will not be able to enter the ballroom
without it! Your invitation is your own, so don't hand it to someone else in order to
invite them!
 
{c2. If there is someone you would like to invite, send a note or message to Silvaria.
She holds the invitations until someone states that they have someone they would like
to invite. She will request a brief meeting, as long as it takes place where she resides
in Kalaman, or in the nearby city of Palanthas. She is one of the hosts of the event, and
is in charge of giving all the details to her guests. The meeting will be brief, but
informative.
 
{C3. The event will be held on June 2, 2012, and begin around 6pm EST. You will need to
come to Kalaman to be admitted into the ballroom. Contact Narcissa, Shimai, or Maelyn on
the night of the event if you need help getting to Kalaman.
 
{c4. You must dress up to attend! This is not voluntary, it is required! That being said,
your ballroom attire does not need to replace your current description. Instead, amend your
description for this event -- add 3-5 lines to the top or bottom of your description, seperated
by a few line breaks and labeled "Ballroom Attire". That makes it easy to remove after.
If you don't have this, Silvaria -will- kick you out. >:[
 
{C5. There will be music via a Spotify playlist. If you don't use Spotify, that's okay. I will
supply a forum post on our website listing music that will essentially set the mood for the event.
You don't need to listen if you don't want to, but if you do, please recreate your account on
legendsofkrynn.net in order to have access.
 
{c6. Emoting and RPing will likely get rather chaotic within the ballroom. It will only be one
room, which means peoples' conversations will overlap. Try to be courteous to your fellow RPers,
but don't be afraid to mingle. Just imagine it as one huge, noisy party!
Relax and have fun. Your character(s) are going to be pampered and have a really good time (I hope)!!!

If you don't mind, next time we're both on, I'd like to pick up the RP

We will get you into the Artisans! And I sincerely apologize for my
sporadic logging. Its so unfair to you. :(
 
 
Our last emotes:
Kiryn gives a nervous laugh, blushing as she glances off across the market. '{cMy friends give me so much more credit than I think I deserve... I still have much to learn. Regardless,{x' she says, looking back to Ferrochel, her cheeks still rosy, '{cI do enjoy sharing my knowledge and helping others learn. If you are interested in that, we'll be happy to have you.{x' She grins happily. '{cI would make a request of you, however,{x' Kiryn adds softly.

Ferrochel grates '{WI wasn't talking about you. By the flaming beard of Sirrion how can you be a master if you dont even have blisters on your hands. Level UP... Anyway I wish to join the artisans, are you the one I should talk too?{x'

Kiryn stops suddenly, blinking as the flush spreads. '{cAh... w-well, I mean, I do my best, of course.  There hasn't been much work around, and... well... anyway,{X' she stammers. '{cW-we'd still be happy to have you. P-perhaps, as you gain your skills amongst us, y-you could find it within you to... well, to teach and help... others...{X' she finishes lamely, looking at the ground.

Ferrochel crosses his arms '{WTeaching, humm...' he scrathes his long red beard, 'How do you feel about hammering some sense in thick heads?{x'
 
Looking forward to RPing with you soon!

Subject Balance~
Text
Mistress, I am sorry for my absense. As I am sure you were aware, there were things within me at battle with itself, keeping me from balance and performing my role. This shall no longer haunt me. I saught refuge near Icewall for an extended time, encasing myself from time while I sorted through it all.
Upon my return, a cleric of Zivilyn has informed me of the dominence of the towers by the black robes. Is this so? It can not stand.

Silvaria: Rules of the Ball!
Tue May 22 10:50:01 2012
To: Narcissa
Following are the rules for the Ballroom event. Be sure to review them carefully,
and direct any questions to Silvaria, Narcissa, Shimai, or Chislev. We hope you
enjoy the event!
 
{C1. Please hold on to your invitation! You will not be able to enter the ballroom
without it! Your invitation is your own, so don't hand it to someone else in order to
invite them!
 
{c2. If there is someone you would like to invite, send a note or message to Silvaria.
She holds the invitations until someone states that they have someone they would like
to invite. She will request a brief meeting, as long as it takes place where she resides
in Kalaman, or in the nearby city of Palanthas. She is one of the hosts of the event, and
is in charge of giving all the details to her guests. The meeting will be brief, but
informative.
 
{C3. The event will be held on June 2, 2012, and begin around 6pm EST. You will need to
come to Kalaman to be admitted into the ballroom. Contact Narcissa, Shimai, or Maelyn on
the night of the event if you need help getting to Kalaman.
 
{c4. You must dress up to attend! This is not voluntary, it is required! That being said,
your ballroom attire does not need to replace your current description. Instead, amend your
description for this event -- add 3-5 lines to the top or bottom of your description, seperated
by a few line breaks and labeled "Ballroom Attire". That makes it easy to remove after.
If you don't have this, Silvaria -will- kick you out. >:[
 
{C5. There will be music via a Spotify playlist. If you don't use Spotify, that's okay. I will
supply a forum post on our website listing music that will essentially set the mood for the event.
You don't need to listen if you don't want to, but if you do, please recreate your account on
legendsofkrynn.net in order to have access.
 
{c6. Emoting and RPing will likely get rather chaotic within the ballroom. It will only be one
room, which means peoples' conversations will overlap. Try to be courteous to your fellow RPers,
but don't be afraid to mingle. Just imagine it as one huge, noisy party!
Relax and have fun. Your character(s) are going to be pampered and have a really good time (I hope)!!!
 
 
{WThank you!!{X

Mistress, I am sorry for my absense. As I am sure you were aware, there were things within me at battle with itself, keeping me from balance and performing my role. This shall no longer haunt me. I saught refuge near Icewall for an extended time, encasing myself from time while I sorted through it all.
Upon my return, a cleric of Zivilyn has informed me of the dominence of the towers by the black robes. Is this so? It can not stand. Through my secluded time I've seen the need of pure balance for this world to function, much like I had to find my own balance or simply come to a dead stop in life. I propose to come under your wing once more, and give this world what it needs- for I have found no signs of advancment and it frightens me.

The eyes of a cougar lock onto an antelope in the distance. Waiting for an opportunity, the predator leaps onto the preys back, tackling it to the ground. Using her long claws to cripple the preys' knees, she quickly lunges and sinks her teeth into the antelopes neck and throat, strangling it to death. The cougar lets of a breath of air between a sigh and a cough. The grass
 surrounding her feet take hold as she bows her head, growing and twisting around her leg as the cougar seemingly melds into the land. Moments later, a hand lunges out of the ground, followed by the body of a healthy young druid by the name of Nidalee. Long brown hair flows from her head, kept out of the way with a tie in the back. Her body marked with light white stripes, much
 like her animalistic forms, and she wears not only the hide nad fur of her prey, but also a belt of trophies such as tusks or large teeth. Her head remains bowed as before the transformation as she gives thanks to the Beast for the successful hunt before she takes the carcass away to cook.
 
Beside a bondfire, the young druid sits pleased with her meal. Noise in the distance is heard and causes her ears to peak. Quickly making her way through the forest, sinking into the earth, reappearing closer and closer to the noise, she finally comes to it. Hidden in the branches of
 a tall oak, she watches as human hunters are on the ground below her. Traps sprung, a healthy rabbit caught by the leg as the men celebrate. "{gYou call this civilized?{x" the druid speaks to herself while watching. One of the men come closer to the trap, but is quickly stopped by a spear thrown by Nidalee, landing at the mans feet.
 
"Hey young thing, why don't you come down here and keep us company?" the man asks, chuckling with the others as they gaze upon her. With a smirk the young druid gracefully lands on the ground, her brown eyes locked and her hand steady, she takes the spear out of the ground as
 the man backs away. "You have some nerve," he says. Without looking away, Nidalee explains "{gThe untamed know no fear. Leave before I ruin my meal with the taste of cowards.{x" After a short stare down, the men leave. Nidalee turns to the captures hare, releasing it but realizing
 its leg is broken. "{gNot today, little hare, not to these disrespectful 'hunters'.{x" she adds, placing a hand on it and heals its wound. As it hobbles away, you see that it is joined by a female and two baby rabbits aswell.
 
Sitting in a forested temple to Chislev, Nidalee asks herself and her god many things; Why do they find amusement in picking on the weak? Why can't they just take what they need instead of punishing the world with greed?  Why don't we hunt the civilized who hunt us, children of 
 nature? Determination in her eyes, her rounded pupils become more cat-like slits as she begins her transformation and leaving, stating simply "{gThey will fear the wild.{x" Leaping through 
 the forest in her cougar form, she continues to think, her thoughts projected to the beast aswell. 'Test my conviction, test my resolve. Guide me, I will be your healer and your spear.'

and then flitting away once the letter has been removed.

script you have seen before. It reads:

Once more, the same type of white bird flutters near you. As per usual,
it finds a place to land and remains still until it determines whether
or not you will take the parchment from it. If you should, the bird
will flutter away almost instantly. The parchment, once unfolded, will
reveal the familiar, lilting handwriting.
 
The letter reads:
 
{yMy friend,
 
My previous letter was not returned to me; I know you must have received it -- and yet,
I have heard no word from you. I do not wish to bother you, and as such... I will not
write again if I don't hear from you... But I desperately hope that you will meet with
me instead.
I cannot promise that I will be able to meet you anywhere near the Towers, or even near
the Forester Temple -- I have been traveling as of late. I do promise, however, that
whenever you should have the time to visit me, I will be able to speak with you,
uninterrupted.

  We are not very well acquainted, and for that I am sorry. I hope my letter finds
you in good health. It was wonderful to see you at the ball, and I do hope that we

  I write you with a note of concern, however, in regards to our mutual friend,
Shimai. I fear that, during my last meeting with Shimai, I may have been excitable,
and, therefore, driven her away with my actions. Under normal circumstances, I would
think she is merely preoccupied with her duties within the Conclave. However, she does
not return my letters, and I haven't seen her in a long while.
 
  I know that mage-kind tends to communicate in ways that require magic and strength of
mind. I would request that you come to me in person, if you have need to speak with me.
I have no aptitude for such skills of the mind.
 
  If I do not see you, I merely ask that you let your dearly betrothed that I miss her,
and that I sincerely apologize for my actions.
 
 
  Thank you so very much, Jasper. Until we meet again.

Unfolding the parchment will reveal a letter written in the same, lilting script.
It reads:
 
 
{yJasper,
 
  We are not very well acquainted, and for that I am sorry. I hope my letter finds
you in good health. It was wonderful to see you at the ball, and I do hope that we
can see one another again soon.
 
  I write you with a note of concern, however, in regards to our mutual friend,
Shimai. I fear that, during my last meeting with Shimai, I may have been excitable,
and, therefore, driven her away with my actions. Under normal circumstances, I would
think she is merely preoccupied with her duties within the Conclave. However, she does
not return my letters, and I haven't seen her in a long while.
 
  I know that mage-kind tends to communicate in ways that require magic and strength of
mind. I would request that you come to me in person, if you have need to speak with me.
I have no aptitude for such skills of the mind.
 
  If I do not see you, I merely ask that you let your dearly betrothed that I miss her,
and that I sincerely apologize for my actions.
 
 
  Thank you so very much, Jasper. Until we meet again.

Subject Clan Leaders~
Text
All -
 
Here's how it works.  No Immortal shall lead their own clan with a mortal alt.
However, there has been allowed, special privleges here and there to bypass
this rule.  These were allowed under dire circumstances where a clan was in
need of a leader, but failed to produce one.  Furthermore, the failure to
produce a leader must be that it's because nobody is willing to take up the
position; not because the leader of that clan is being picky and refuses
everyone who asks for the position because said person does not model the
Immortal's standards to a proverbial "tee".  In these rare occurances, I've
only allowed the Immortal to lead their own clan with their own Mortal alt,
until someone who was both able and willing to lead the clan, did so.  Upon
the induction of said leader, the Immortal would remove their Mortal alt from
the position.
 
As for Mortals (those not being played by any Immortal), there is a different
side of things.  It is not necessarily a rule per say, that a Mortal player
can not have more than one (1) character leading a Clan.  We've actually had
similar scenarios throughout our 12 year history where this has occured. As
a matter of fact, we currently have 1 or 2 Immortals who were in this very
situation with their *own* mortal characters prior to becoming an Immortal.
We used to have heated discussions over on the Forums back when I had created 
"special sections" where your account had to be given special access to view
the content.  Some people were given access to multiple clan sections because they
had mortal characters leading more than one clan.  Now, that all aside, do we
actively support this sort of scenario? No.  Should we encourage people to try
to lead more than one clan? Definitely not.  It takes a special type of person to
be able to pull off this feat; one that even I would admittedly would strugle with.
I believe Sethis ( Darkahn ) would definitely fit the bill on this, which was why
I had agreed to his request; along with the fact that our MUD isn't necessarily
booming with players to a degree where we could afford to flat out determine that
this shouldn't even be something to even consider, let alone agree to it.  So with
that unique combination of who he is as a player, and our current circumstance,
Sethis has been allowed to be a leader.  Even he had agreed in person that if the
right people came along (and were active) and wanted the position, but couldn't
because they had all been filled already, Sethis would then step down.  These types
of circumstances must be considered if we are to survive as a MUD.  In case nobody's
really taken notice, MUDs aren't exactly drawing big crowds of new players these
days.  Hell, they even have free Online MMORPGs via Google's Chrome Web Store.  I
checked a couple of them out to see how well they're designed, and granted, most
of them a garbage; primarily filled with eye candy graphics, but suck ballsack when
it comes to content delivery.  We have the opposite problem.  We have a ton of
content, but little eye candy because we're a text based game.  And unfortuntely,
the reality is that most kids/adults these days are after the big ticket graphics.
True, most get bored when they've beaten a game in less than 6 hours because the
content was poor, or they actual content starts to feel like it's just a re-hash
of everything else (WoW rehashes a lot of their content and just updates with new
names and new graphics, but content is identical).
 
It's a different time folks, and unless we grow back in popularity again, don't be
too surprised to see me change my ideology in regards to a few things here and there
to help ensure the survival of this MUD; allowing multi-playing is a big example.
Anyone who knew me even as few as 4 years ago, knew how I stood in regards to that
and would have never thought they would see the day where I would have allowed it,
regadless of any cicrumstance.

Subject Further Decisions~
Text
Just an addendum to my previous note, I would like everyone to take note
that there are times when circumstance dictates decisions, not a man sitting
behind an "iron mask".  I would like all of you to make these sorts of
decision making processes yourselves.  Rather than waiting for me so you can
ask questions about what you should or should not do, or perhaps if it would
be okay to do something, just ask yourself if situation should help guide
you in your decision making.  If it's logical and/or rational without being
subjective, by all means, make the decision on your own; I highly encourage
that type of behavior.  Promotions are based on actions, but not just
actions as in, you can Roleplay well and do a lot of work to help entertain
players, but also based on your role as an Immortal in making decisions of
your own, instead of coming to myself or a higher Imm to make the decision
for you.  Don't worry, I'm less likely to demote or fire an Immortal based
on action, than I am based on inaction.

Hey Nui,
 
I've not been around very long, but I love hearing about old characters'
stories. I think it would be wonderful to see your character(s)' stories,
as a little snapshot of the history of Krynn. :)
 
I'm working on a loose "novelization" of my own Silvie's story, as she
is pretty tightly woven with Darkahn, and their development has been
extremely motivational and inspirational to me. I totally understand the
feeling of having so much creativity and not knowing what to do with it!!
I even started learning how to build in MUDs to try and find an outlet
for my own!!
 
I hope I've answered your question... And, let me say from my own point of
view, that I think it would be amazing for you to get one of your characters
back, or even roll a new one. I've been trying very hard to bring new people
into the MUD, and if it starts paying off, we may have some fresh, new RP!!
 
 
Looking forward to seeing what you have planned! Let me know if you are blogging
it, as I have a Tumblr and a Blogger with which to follow. :)
 
Sincerely,

Druul, Just to inform you I do not use the coupons myself, every level 100 i will be honest, i paid to donate. As for the triggers it was not just me who had an issue with it. In fact I was not even the one to bring it up in immortal land, I was just the one who sent a friendly note to you hoping that you would understand and possibly log out for a few hours a night. 
It's disconcerting to other mortals who hop on and see that you have been on, none stop over a 24 hour period. Trust me on this one, I hear about it. Ether through the mud or other means of communication. As for the triggering, Fine.. while you are able to be near the computer be my guest, I know smiths are dull as hell, but I also know they can be leveled without triggers, I have seen it.
who The poor guy is 99 right now and just hit it, but it can still be done. And if you are thinking I was taking a personal stab at you, I was not. After all I don't know if you log your chats, but you should be able to clearly see that i have rewarded you experience every day, I know how leveling a smith can be, i gave up with mine at 40.
Now as for taking this to the whole player base. I wash you would have just spoken to me. I hate to tell you, I am not as evil and vile as you make me out to be in that note, As stated before, I was just hoping you would read the note i sent and understand that you can't be on 24 hours in a day, if hid would have seen that i am sure he would have done a lot worse,
in fact he was on this morning before you logged back in, You could always ask him what he would have done.
My attempt to save you from getting in worse trouble with you panting me to be a horribly rude person, but I am sorry if i allowed you for at least 5 days to continue to be logged in, letting you get some levels, before it was brought up to me that it needs to stop and that the immortals of before would have taken to other means of punishment without warning. 
I will leave this note with I am sorry if you are unhappy, It was not my intent to cause that but instead hold up to the rules that Hiddukle has in the books, and i will hold up to them unless he says otherwise.

Hey Asauder,
 
I don't know if you know me, though I've seen you a couple

I wanted to give you a little heads up that there have been
some major things happening regarding the Nuinqua in an RP
that Darkie and I have been doing. I want to include you, because
Asauder is one of the Nuinqua (and Silvaria is, too), and the events
would be something Asauder as a character would have participated
in, if he's still loyal to Darkahn.
Well, I thought so, at least... I don't want to make any assumptions,
though, of course. ^^;
 
 
Anyway, if you'd like to get caught up with the basics, just let
me or Darkie know. I can be found floating around the game, or on
the forums. Or, send me an e-mail at tennyo243@gmail.com.

Before I left these lands some time ago, I entrusted the port town of Port O'Call, that had been conquered by me, over to you.
 
Coming back I find it strange that there is no Knight of Takhisis in sight and I have learned through one of my brethren that the town is being controlled by militia that responds to you.
Not that I doubt their allegiance to the Knights, but I think it would be wise to post a few, four or five should suffice, Knights of the Lilly to oversee the operations and report directly to you.

This note is written upon a piece of parchment that is charred

thick scrawl on the front that is barely recognizable as your name.
It is a wonder that the note even found its way to you. Upon opening
the parchment, similar writing is found along the inside.
 
It reads:

Subject Character Creation~
Text
Hiddukel,

Please allow me to apologize for my wrongs against you on during many years on 
your MUD. My behavior was extremely inappropriate, immature, and lacked the 
respect that Legends of Krynn deserved. It was a disruption and distracted 
 others from enjoying their gameplay.. and I felt I could amp things up, but in 
reality, I only made things worse.

It was embarrassing, but I learned that nobody appreciated my poor behavior. 
In the future, I have every intention of curbing my thoughtless actions and 
learn to adjust my behavior befitting the environment and situation. 

Again, I owe You, the playerbase, the Staff, and friends, a sincere apology 
for my lack of personal integrity. (Which you yourself pointed out to me, but 
I was too blinded by teenage youth to care.)
 
It was never my intention to create such an awkward and uncomfortable 
situation. I hope that I can be of assistance in correcting my mistake and 
resolving the matter because I do want to build, as a mortal (we can of course 
discuss this if I am ever qualified again to have such range.)
 
While I have caused this unpleasant experience, I am able to see where I went 
wrong. LYING is not a policy that built this MUD, nor is it the way you run a 
roleplaying environment. I believe acquiring this insight will allow me to 
learn and grow and prevent similar issues in the future.
 
I am humbled and would like to return to the Legends of Krynn and I saw that 
just maybe with you feeling a bit Jolly for the Holidays I would ask kindly 
that "Marthias" be unblocked from character creation. Please feel free to let 
me of your thoughts and concerns over this matter. 
 
I am sorry for my actions and I hope that we can put this matter behind us. I 
look forward to talking and not just speaking to you again/soon. If you have 
any thoughts in this, please feel free to share.
 
Sincerely,
James
 
(And NO, Dylan will not be joining me.. Darkahn inspired me to humble myself
and see if you felt up to doing such a request, as I'm afraid you do not
have a backup file for Marthias anywhere.)

A wandering undead zombie staggers slowly to you. 'Arrrgghhh A missive...arouuuggghh for you'. The zombie hands you a scroll. Upon opening it you find it's written in {Rblood{x.
 
{RBretheren
 
The mages of the Conclave are to be killed at will. Do nit touch Darkahn... Or Rayo. Every other weak mage is to be killed. The TowerMaster Darkahn made threats upon myself and two others with Lich Lord zeath present.
 
Said the Undead are targets. For those of you who can Master your art of finger breaking... And for those who have it... Tounge cut. Let it be known soldiers of the Lord Of Death shalt not be bulliedbor patronized by the likes of the mages of the conclave.
 
So I strongly advise travel in groups of two. And for those who can, Make sure you can see the invisible. Mages can hide behind the safety of their magics. So be aware! Go undead Legion Send their souls straight to Chemosh.

A piece of parchment lies here, bound by a thin cord and
marked with a pale, green leaf. Unraveling the cord
and unfolding the parchment would reveal a quickly
scribbled note -- though the handwriting is familiar.
It reads:
 
{DDarkahn,
 
Recent events have me worried. I have not
heard from you since I sent my last missive.
First, there were murmurs of armies forming
to the north, and last night, I deterred an
intruder to the Forester Temple. He did not
frighten me, himself, but his appearance was
far from natural. He had red, glowing eyes,
and cracked, ancient armor. He claimed to have
been leader of the Foresters at one time,
though I have a hard time believing such.
 
I digress. He spoke of being pursued, and
having come to the Forester Temple for
sanctuary. I drove him away, though he would
not stop speaking of being hunted. I am
concerned now, that he will purposely lead
them here.
 
If he was even telling the truth. I cannot
stop thinking. I mull over the stand off over
and over in my head. He had no place here,
of that I am certain. The guards finally told
me that he struck at them when they tried to
hold him from entering. Golametti still heals
one of them from the wound he sustained.
 
But, if he is being hunted, what will he
lead here?
 
I am sorry to trouble you with this. Slavimir
is well. He was either sleeping or exploring
the Temple last night, and was not involved
with the intruder. If you wish, Shimai had
come to visit me, and she was present during
the conversation I had with this strange
person. Perhaps she knows more.
 
I miss you, Darkahn. Please be well.
 
 
Only yours,

Lord mage, i write to you to convey a series of concerns of mine.
The undead have been seen in several positions around the city of Palanthas.
The current men at arms of Palanthas are few in number. Once we had what could be
considered a proud standing army, But desertion and treason among the ranks has 
caused our numbers to dwindle to the bleak force we see today. Only one true knight
remains at post in Palanthas, while others come and go as they please. Choosing 
mercenary work for coin and pleasure over the honor the knight hood once stood for.
While this is one topic i have sought to contact you over, it is not the main.
{/
{/
   The walls of Palathas have been called impregnable, but In my lifetime i have
witnessed the Death Knight Soth fell the walls with one word. Soth has long since
vanished, but traces of his order remain, and now one of his knights is within our
walls, a captive of ours if we can call him such. With the power and skills at his
disposal i am lead to believe he is here cause he wants to be. Under normal circumstances
we would exterminate any such as him, but the Order of the Black Rose is known for
being immortal. We can strike him down, though it is no easy matter, but he simply rises
again. From the books i have read and people i have spoken to, it seems that death knights
affect by a curse such as his are bound to a mortal object of some kind. What ever it may be
, my readings of Soth and his actions over the years since the cataclysm it is my belief that
the object the Black rose knights are bound to, is there heart. Though we
have no proof of this, we have confirmed that Aorac in all his foulness is missing his
heart.
{/
{/
  Again this is only but one point I'd like to discuss with you. I would like to ask, magic not
being my field of expertise, does having this death knight captive in our city
pose a threat to the city. If yes, how can we seal him away from the city to prevent harm.
How can we fortify the city with so few in numbers against so many?
It is not often that the knighthood seeks help from outside our ranks, but news has reached my
ear that you have defeated several of the legion in the city of Kalaman, and this has
given me a spark of hope.

It is in an hour of need that we send you this missive, It has come to our knowledge that the forests on the west of Palanthas are going to be swarmed by undead troops.
It is recorded on our libraries that this forests are inhabited by some unique life forms, namely deers, wolves and hairy beasts.
So this missive serves to humbly beg you to provide us with some assistance, It is of my humble belief that a few marksman located on our forests will be enough to cause huge losses on the undead ranks.

Familiar white birds make their way through the forests of Abanasinia,

absent of the Temple. The messages are scribed upon parchment that
has been rolled tightly and is held closed with a thin cord. Unrolling
the parchment will reveal a message written in dark graphite, in a
lilting script. It reads:
 
{DTo my fellow Foresters,
 
I have hesitated in contacting anyone from outside
the immediate Temple, as I did not want to sound a
"false alarm" of sorts. However, if any of you have
kept your ears and eyes towards civilization, you
will know that the Undead have staged an attack
against those of Palanthas and Vingaard.
 
I have not responded. I am of the belief that these
attacks are none of our concern. Palanthas remains
the target of the Undead -- and has not fallen in
any recent history. I believe our focus should lie
here, and in fortifying ourselves in the event that
Palanthas should fall.
 
Not all will agree, I am sure. That is why this message
reaches you now. If you have any dispute in my decision,
I invite you to act upon your own judgment. Find other
like-minded individuals within our clan, and move to
the North with them.

Hey, how's it going?
I've been reading your notes and I enjoy them alot, but there is something that keeps distracting me.

You seem to use conjunctions well enough, don't = do not   couldn't = could not, but you use
other apostrophes in the wrong places in most of your notes.  I'm not talking shit I promise, but if you brush
up on your grammar it will make your notes read better and look more professional.

"He doesn't turn he keep's watching as he speaks" is a quote from your note.
Conjunctions, like "doesn't" must be able to work in the same sentence without the conjunction.
Example, "He does not turn he..."
However, the "keep's" should not have an apostrophe.  You would write it that way if the word keep was possessive.
Example... The keep's soldiers are well disciplined.  The soldiers belong to the keep, so it gets an 's.

The line in your note should be written "He doesn't turn he keeps watching as he speaks"
"Let's just say I've found a way and leave it at that" is another quote where the apostrophe should not be there.
"After issuing his order's he makes his way toward the other's" ... neither apostrophe belong there.
The sentence would have an apostrophe if written this way.. The soldier's orders were strictly followed.

Like I said I really enjoy reading your stories and others, but I thought I could offer you some advice to spruce it up a bit.
Please don't take offense.

I have wandered much as of late, looking for a purpose. I have noticed that the great city of Palanthas seems to be compromised. 
I would be beyond honored to be able to help you in the defense of my birthplace, and would like to join your ranks once qualified.
Dutifully yours,

I had this whole big thing i was gonna go on about degrading the sacred act of marriage with a starwars theme
What god would say,
The extreme lvls of dork activity i saw just then.
And a few other things.
But to be completely honest, that took big nuts.
And commitment is commitment.However you decide to wed is not as important as the commitment to one another.
If your happy and she is happy and you dont get divorced like most poeple then thats all that matters.
I take marriage and what it represents very seriously.
A man should leave his mother and father and join with his wife.
Im proud of you and wish you the best of luck.
Its hard to do the man thing.
 
Sincerely,
Arlanthis
 
P.S. please forgive me if i sounded dickish anywhere in that.Im happy for you.

Text
Hiddukle, I write to you on behalf of myself and the Immortal staff of
Krynn.  It has come to our attention of constant cheating and ignoring of
rules by the player of Lunitari and his brother the player of Dontavious. 
It has been noticed that there are times where lunitaris mortals are on but
not his mortal, there are also times where it is believed his brother is the
one instead on his mortal.  I have their sockets within my files of the
loggins.  Who It has also been stated that on times the typing style is like
night and day depending on what socket Lunitari is on.  The next thing that
has happened in the recent is his constant interrupting of RP that has
nothing to do with his character or his clan, as well as stepping on the
toes of chemosh by promoting the title and character of his brother by
pretitles within the ranks of the undead.  Lunitari also as of recent and
constant has gathered gear with his immortal for his own and his brother's
character.  Another instance is using immortal commands to give his brother
the advantage with knowing where a mortal is.  He is also constantly even
after being told not to been using the IC channels for OOC contact of
mortals.  Who There may be more to it as I do not have all of the
information, staff being myself Chislev, Zeboim, Chemosh, and Paladine. 
This may also include that of Solinari, Sargonas and Zivilyn, but at this
point I have not spoken to them about this.  Of last I heard Morgoin has
also caught him cheating.  I understand that punishment is that of what you
determine is the best action, though ti would be suggested to have Lunitari
removes as a staff for he will not even correct his actions when caught
doing them, as well as do not allow his brother, the player of dontavius to
become an immortal as it is beleved he is using lunitaris immortal for
himself.  Chislev <3

Text
OOC: Thank you for taking the time to take a look at this application
form.  I will take this moment to say that I know it is not normal for the
Conclave to accept one of Draconic blood.  I also know that this will most
likely be disregarded and declined, but I still thought I could try.  Now I
believe this could be a good chance for some great Role Playing.  Reading up
on Aurak Draconians, I seen that they can use their "wild dragon" magic to
change their form for any purpose they need.  If accepted into the Conclave,
I see this as a good potential for a good story, A draconian who takes the
form of an Elf (a race he hates most) who walks the halls of High Sorcery,
apprenticing under someone, learning, fulfilling his obession for power and
control of magicks.  When he is in the halls, he keeps up the charade of of
elf, though when he leaves the tower on his own ambitions, or retreats to
palanthas to his own little meditation retreat(where some necromantic
experitments will take pace ;P ) or when is just plain in his own chambers,
he sheds said skin, and once again his large golden Aurak self.  NAME: Tontz
RACE: Draconian Subspeicies: Aurak Class: Necromancer Circle: 25 FAKE NAME:
Terragyn Graywind RACE: Silvanesti Elf IC: Tontz was born the same as all of
his now hated kind.  It all started in the egg, the dragon's dream filling
his mind, the dreams of flight, of grand treasure.  But one day something
changed in that peaceful dream of his ancestors; a darkness started to seep
slowly into his dreams, and slowly that dark taint's flow grew larger; it
changed the dream, a dream of goodness became a dream for hate, anger and
death.  It became a dream of magicks and great power.  This new touch, this
new dream corrupted this unborn gold dragon's mind, spirit and physical
form.  At first it pleaded for death, this was unnatrual, this was not what
it was to become, but death didn't come, and the taint never ceased.  Soon,
the growing gold (if you could call it a gold dragon now) accepted this
dream, there was no escaping it, he accepted the thirst for death, for
power.  Then a vision appeared to the youngling, a vision of a beautiful
woman; a woman who welcomed him like a mother would welcome her child. 
<come to me my sweet child...  > the youngling gold clawed for his way to
her, <come my sweet child.  Rise from the darkness, and with it breath
DEATH!  > The gold broke out of his egg with a roar, this was no dragon,
this was something else, the dark magicks whispered around him
---draconian--- -draconian--- and the creature bellowed, he could feel the
dark magic calling for him.  Not long after the hatching, and when he was
ready for training, the creature was given a name, Tontz.  During tests by
the dark wizards of Takhisis, Tontz did not accept the sword they laid
infront of him; no he would not be a warrior.  These Dark Mages smiled with
pure evil, that was a good answer for them, he was meant for more.  The laid
before him spellbooks: Conjuration, Enchantment, Illusion, and lastly
Necromancy.  Tontz stared at this books with calculating thoughts, he felt
it again, the pressence of magic calling for him, but there was more.  Each
book had a pull for him, but the last, that black book with purple etching
inlaid, its sweet music made him drunk with dreams of greatness.  He choose
his fate, his obsession that moment: Necromancy.  Tontz was trained in the
art of necromancy, he was trained how to control his abilities, shown how to
use his own innate abilities, and to use those magicks to change his form to
others.  The war raged on, and Tontz was used in the ranks of wizards.  He
wreaked death upon the enemy with his magic, but that was not the worst of
it, the true ugliness was taking the enemies dead and making them his own. 
Though the Dragon Armies had great victories, they were driven back, and the
Dark Queen was once again felled by mortals who fought for the Gods of
Light.  The armies scattered, though some tried to stick together, plan a
new strategy, the Queen would gain her victory.  This was Tontz' moment.  He
was free from the grasp, others around him scattered.  An ugly grinn shown
on that face, the ambitions of the Queen was not as important as his own
ambitions to become the most powerful of wizards, to be a master
Necromancer.  Tontz left on his own, with taking a form of a wimpy
sing-song, tree-hugging elf.  Making his was through krynn, Tontz (going by
the name of Terragyn Grawind) made his way to the Great City of Palanthas. 
There taking up shelter in an abandoned home, away from others, Tontz begain
his own research and experiments.  Stealing children, animals, homless, he
trained more in the arts.  One day, out in the Mage district as the elf
Tarragyn, he heard of the Tower of High Sorcery, his kind was never told of
such a place to go and train, his kind would never be accepted there.  As
the elf, Tontz inquired more, and there learned that he had to take a test
if he was even allowed through the woods.  "Oh, send a missive to the Tower!
They will look it over."  He nodded and thanked the unknown mage, and made
his way home, and sneer on his face as he went back to his true form
reaching his home.  "NOW I WILL GAIN TRUE POWER!"

Hello, my fellow brothers and sisters of Magic! The three moons bless you, and most of all Nuitari bless the black robes and help the progress in their studies.
My name is Terragyn Graywind, follower of our great Black Moon Nuitari, a necromancer to his name, and exile to the Silvanesti, Dark Elf.
I have been exiled from my home of Silvanost.  Those wretched creatures do not understand the truth of magic, that death is a signigicatn part of it.  They did not apparently understand my research and experiments. 
Their loss though, they could have learned something as I sure have.  But then again, my research was a bit unorthodox, and I guess husbands, wives, or children going missing does make it a bit noticeable after a fashion.
I have made my way to Palanthas, they call me an abomination in that cursed home of Silvanost, and sadly if I returned for any of the stuff I could not grab, I would be killed on the spot. Something, I do not wish of yet, for I have not got as far as I'd like in my art.
As I said, I reside in Palanthas, and as I do like to have my alone time, study and work alone, I must say I require more training, and need help from a great mind to help another become another great mind.  The Tower will be a great home to me, and I a great patron to the Tower.  As you attribute to my growth, my growth will attribute to the Tower.
I hope you will take consideration, and I hope if need be, look past my unorthadox past. 
Thank you,
Terragyn Graywind

My name is Therin Skybreeze.I was once a disciple of the Goddess of Nature Chislev but abandoned my call and after
a sudden storm I found myself drawn to the dark oceans edge.I witnessed firsthand the power of nature in its angered form as lightning
and winds ripped shipping vessels off the coast to peices and the splintered timber washed up at my feet.
I realized the futility of my life as a simple forest planter and nurturer, and took up my true calling to the Storm.
With the forests no longer my home I call on the BlackOrder to accept me so I may further spread the glory of the Storm.

Hey Tontz :)
 
I had a little difficulty posting your RP log, but it was mere semantics.
I had Solinari post it under his name, instead, and I hope we handled it
the way you wished. I did forward the application to the Conclave and
Tontz's background to Hidd. I'm sure he'll contact you when he gets to
reading them.
 
If you have anything that needs to be edited, please just let me or Soli
know, and we'll be happy to take care of it for you. Thanks!!

Laying firmly on the center of your desk lies a small note. It has a familiar handwriting in blue ink. There is a small symbol of the Blue Lady in the upper right corner, abreviated under it ZC. The note reads:
Don't encourage the spineless undead to make a move. We all know they are all talk, let's not force their hand, for your own and your families sake. I'm sorry if our little bout the other night saddened you, or something. However, provoking an attack on yourself doesn't help. You are the cleric of Zivilyn, use your brain here and be smart; this is not a show of strength, it is one of weakness.

A relaxed and familiar prayer is sent. You know many things of this boy from previous prayers and observations. He was abandoned by his traitor of an undead mother and left floating to his slow death in the blood sea. He was picked up by some followers of yours, the Mahkwahb elves. Seeing promise in this young man, the elves raised him as one of their own; teaching him the ways of Maelstrom, as she was called in the blood sea.
 
The most important lesson learned from them is simply thus: Live the way you want, take what you want, do what you want; let those who are helpful be rewarded, let those who oppose you feel your wrath.
 
{gMaelstrom, I have recently ventured from the sea in hopes of finding what else lies outside. It's pathetic, in my opinion, almost everywhere I go there is mindless creatures doing mindless things. Holding their tongue and sword to save face or because another said they should? These "people" are not people, they seem to care little for their own free will. Had I been closer to home, I'd have brought some of their parts back for shark food. 
 
I find myself compelled to bring freedom to these creatures. Either by death or by learning, they should all come to understand the ways that you have taught me. There is a group, they call themselves the blackorder. They've been rather boring lately, but the stories of their activities leads me to believe that they are simply waiting and planning.

hmm, your note is worded weird to me. it says "i will give u 1000k steel", then it says "you will gain 500,000 steel". they are different. :s and why? cause i have it and don't need it. the least it can go towards is getting someone something they want. you should ask Aorac, or Tharm. he drew his own characters and uploaded the pics to facebook. he doesnt get on often tho.. not that i can tell.

It wasn't you or any other player in the game. I left to concentrate on my military obligations. I was deployed to the combat zone and I didnt have a whole lot of internet.

Greetings, my brothers and sisters of the forge!
My name is Garrowynn Blacksteel of Thorbardin, Hylar birthright, Once a smith of Reorx, Now a Warrior for his Forge!
I send you this missive of admission to the guild, though I am blacksmith no longer, I still seek the embrace of the guild and our forge Reorx.
 
I left my home in the mountains, and my riches (Though, I do try to visit when I can, keep my values in check); when the war had looked bleak.  When I heard the blasted Queen was once again, trying to set foot on krynn, I knew this meant even our kind, the dwarves were in danger.  And of, course my riches.
I threw down my hammer, and left my forge, and my home.  Donning my great-grandfather's armor, and his favored battle axe, I headed out to joing the uniting of the nations to fight the darkness that loomed over us.
During this Great War, I was in many battles, and after a good amount of torment, my grandfather's armor, was not keeping up.  I found a lone forge, and spening every waking moment, I made my own armor, which was stronger, and a new battle-axe and war-hammer of black, flaring with red.
I became known as Blacksteel, and to this day I carry the name.  Now the war is over, so they say; I still have not returned to Thorbardin to rest. I know that vile woman will never quit, and I need to protect our homes, our blacksmith's, in the name of Reorx, I protect all who claim the forge their home.
I would be honored, if the brotherhood of artisans would accept my axe and hammer in the halls, to protect that which I swore.

Floating in magical outposts throughout Ansalon is an announcement
directly from Wayreth.  The parchment is scribed in an elegant cursive,
obviously the penmanship of a Silvanesti, though the tongue is common.  
 
It reads:
 
"{DTo whom it may concern,
 
Several changes are being made within the Orders of High Sorcery.
These changes encompass the following:
 
Ordermistress Phiaera has been relieved of her duty. We thank her for her service,
however, a more active face is needed to run the White Robes. As such,
former High Mage Shimai has received a promotion to Ordermistress.
Congratulations are in order for one of the
few White Robes who has truly impressed me so, and
managed to avoid obvious hypocrisy.
 
Battlemages and spellfilchers are officially allowed
within our walls, if they follow the laws of High Sorcery otherwise.
Of course, we recommend more... traditional specifications.
 
Lastly, our research has shown us that -certain- bards
have a penchant for the arcane that we were not previously
aware of. These sonomancers are allowed, rarely, into the
Conclave of Wizards, if they follow our rules and become
more than mere dabblers in our art.
 
That is all.{x"

Greetings, my brothers and sisters!
May the light of Paladine guide your blade and bring this world from the evil that ravages it.
 
My name is Garrin Barklow, son of Sir Garrison Barklow, Knight of the Crown.  My father has fought, bled and has sweated his very life for the cause of the Knights, and he didn't just stop there.  Only having one son, I Garrin Barklow, he devoted all his time from the age I could hold a wooden sword and shield.
My father poured in all of his life, his spirit and his love into training me in the ways of knighthood and in the ways of the Gods of Good, most in hand, our Great Paladine.
I remember my days growing up after I began this training, i ate with a sword, I slept with my sword, I did -everything- even my daily chores with that sword.  This was my bonding with my father, the only love I ever knew from him.  When I wasn't learning blade and shield, I learned compassion, I learned of chivalry.
 
Two years ago, my brothers and sisters, Sir Garrison Barklow retired from the ranks of the Crown, after a mission in Por 'o' Call, he was left lame in one leg, and half the feeling in his left arm, thank fully, not his sword arm.  My father tried to train me more the best, he could.
A year later, when I was 19 years, some how my father had taken fever, and the only thing the clerics of Mishakal can think, is that the wounds in his heart and soul took the plunge.  On my fathers dying bed, he told me it was time to seek you, the Knights of Solamnia out, and to continue his name.
I write to you, asking you to allow me into your ranks. Honor my father and his name, and I will honor you all, and the Gods of Good.
Thank you,
Garrin Barklow.

Greetings, my fellow brothers and sisters of the Dark!
May Morgion the rolling black engulf your enemies, may he have them writhe in pain and agony, their eyes bleed tears!
 
I am Dargonas Blackbreath, and I seek entrance to this sacred order.
I come from the forests, or I did once, and once I lived with a tribe, revered as a sacred one, one touched by their gods.
And maybe once I was touched by my peoples Gods. I cured the sick, I fed the hungry and gave those who needed it the sweetness of water.  Those who were close to death, I helped them.
But a plague had hit our tribe, one I never seen before.  It came from no where, we had not been in contact with no other tribe, or traveler for a while.
I tried to save them, I tried to alleviate their pain, I tried to give them hope.  My tribe was a ver large one, over sixty adults, and fourty children. Yes, we were a very large tribe, a tribe that prospered because of me. I was their light.
Every one of them died before my eyes when I tried to heal them. I failed every time to remove the plague from them, I failed every time to understand the sickness, I gave up hope in the gods.  It was then, when I was crying in frustration as I held my dying mother in my arms, I couldn't save her, I was a failure.  I gave up at that moment, I forsaken Mishakal right there, may she rot in an everlasting agony! She killed my tribe!
It was in that moment, while I cried to the heavens that I'd do anything anything to see my mother live, that a darkness seemed to roll over me, my hands burned and my body began to wrack in pain, <THE MUST ALL DIE, MY CHILD. THIS IS HOW IT IS. ALL THINGS PERISH, DISEASE IS EVERLASTING.> I felt the heat in my hands radiate, they became hotter and hotter, and I felt the plague leaving my mother quickly dying body.
<I WILL HELP YOU. BUT I PROMISE THIS, SHE MUST DIE AS IT IS FOREVER CERTAIN.> The darkness in my mind shuddered, <I WILL GIVE YOU THE POWER. I WILL GIVE YOU A MOMENT WITH HER, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!>
My breath left me, yes! The plague was leaving her body, but it wasn't gone. It was entering my own body, its new vessel.  My body writhed in pain and agony, I screamed to the heavens, and all I got in return was laughing.  I still remember after that, my body was left completly different, a host for disease, forever scared by my deal I made with The Great Lord Morgion that day.
 
Well, my mother did live, and after a moment, my pain subsided.  My mother smiled weakly to me, "Find a new tribe, Dargonas, you must help others, if this get out there, you can save them...." her eyes were fading, "You saved me...bless Mishakal" I shook my head, and kissed my mothers forhead, "No, mother, Mishakal, curse her! She killed you!" A blood tear dropped down on my mother, and her face was horrified. 
"I'm sorry, mother."  I knew what to do, I knew his price to my new found power. I had to sacrafice the one I loved to keep it, or surely I would parish myself.  I opened my mouth and blew into my mothers face, a black cloud of what seemed like locust engulfed her body, and there I sat watching her body rot and decay.
 
I left the tribe, their corpses rotting away. It was time to move on. I found a new tribe in the forests not far from Qualinost.  They accepted me in, thinking I was a blessing from once again, Mishakal.  Though, I wore black robes, they were robes of a cleric, and I wore a turqoise medallion(though it wasnt a relic of Mishakal) they took me as hers.
They welcomed me, and then it happened. The tribe went to war with another tribe, raids happened. And many of my new tribe were taken, or raped and murded. Or just plain murded.  They begged me for help, but I didn't want to. I still had trouble accepting my new found power, I didn't know how to use it and keep it a secret.
The war raged on, and the peoples of the forest knew of my power, I made fires of the heavens strike, I made the earth shake and tremble with just a few words.
The rival tribe trembled, but they didn't stop. And sadly, there were only a few of us left of my kind in the forests.  Taking only a couple of swords for backup, I snuck with them to the rival camp. 
I looked down on the tribe with a satisfaction, I reveled in what was to come.  Telling them to move behind me, the two obeyed.  Sucking in a deep breath, I opened my mouth wide and release, a cloud of the darkest black of diseased locust flew down to the tribe.
Men and women, children and elderly all cried out in the night, they ran out of their tents, they clawed their eyes, their faces maked with pocked disease and death. I muttered a prayer to Morgion, and left with my two swords back to our tribe.
Mutters were heard, I was then being called Blackbreath, and that was when my tribe started to relaize I was different, they finaly noticed my skin and my eyes.
When I was about to take off, and leave this tribe in death, terror struck at us all. We were ambushed by our cousions of Qualinesti, and knights in black armor.  We were rounded up, and shoved into caged wagons, "Slaves" they called us. I was no slave! I was the Blackbreath, I was only owned by one, and that was my Dark Master.
These new men noticed my skin, my eyes, tinged yellow, looking diseased.  Others in the cages, muttered "Blackbreath" "The eyes of death!"  The Qualinesti and the dark knights puzzled at this one.  Finaly, they wrangled me up, and demanded answers, "Why do they say this?!" they looked at me in disgust, "Why have they let you live this long?"

I snarled at the enemy, and then laughed, "Them?! They not let me live! My master, he lets me live!"  I rose to my feet, standing with pride in my faith. "Why they say Blackbreath? I will show you." I smiled, and once again sucked in my breath and released. My captors feel dying in pain, and I left them, and my so-called tribe to die. I would find a safe haven, Morgion would lead me the right way.

As though she had somehow gotten the small white dove to wait for her to

its small feet.  
The paper, as it is opened, emits a smell like the smoke of a pinewood fire,
perhaps suggesting that the response had been written in front of a
campfire. The words are scrawled with a familiar, but somewhat messy,
script:

Scrolls find their ways to the couriers of the Legion -- they are all
identical, though handwritten, and sealed with a Lily stamp.  If one were to
break the seal, the scroll would read: 
 
"{DWith all due respect,
 
The Dark Queen and Her Children do not bow to demands for assistance, Zeath, especially
to those who cannot even scribe a proper message without abbreviation befitting
a barely literate rogue. One day you reject the Legion, the next you embrace it -- which
is it? Obviously your loyalty waivers, and such leadership is questionable at best.
My faith has never swayed.
 
Dontavius,
While your missive was well received much more than that of your comrade's, and
while I wish you the best of luck in somehow succeeding to take and hold
Palanthas when countless others who actually proved themselves before they were
declared to be a 'warlord', my efforts are on focusing strength within 
the Nerakan borders.
 
Your memories all seem suspect. I have been Lord of the Dark Knights since before most
of you were born. I do not recall, at any point, the Legion's assistance.
 
 
As such, I cannot spare the men, nor will I assist you.{x"
 
{DSubmit to Her will, and be strong!

A raven flies past, letting out a loud "caw" as it drops something from
its talons -- a scroll, sealed with the Lily wax stamp.  
Upon breaking the seal, the missive reads:
 
"{DDontavius,
 
If I had a sword for everyone who "conquered" Kalaman or Dart but could not hold it for
any longer than a few hours, I would be able to spare the soldiers to assist in eradicating
our mutual enemy: the Solamnics.
 
The last true person who held claim to Kalaman was indeed one of the eternal legion.
He had bone soldiers and liches there, readily apparent, at all time of day. While
he did such, the Knights of Takhisis held Solanthus and Vingaard -- if you know
your geopolitics, such are far more important pieces.
 
You obviously have a thirst for combat. Of that, I have no doubt -- but
do not confuse your undeath with invulnerability.
 
It pains me that you did not come to the Queen. The Vision would have guided
you well.{x"

Once more a raven delivers a missive to you; its familiar Lily seal
shows who has written it before it is even opened.
 
The scroll reads:
 
"{DIf what you say is true, and you saw our goddess --
despite the small fact of her imprisonment in the Abyss --
then I am sure she has the power to either keep you
within the Legion, as Chemosh serves her, or to restore
your mortality.
 
I am not interested in a meeting. My business is on
Abanasinia -- and, certainly, with all your
massive invasion plans, you cannot be bothered to leave
Solamnia.
 
If you find your mortality indeed restored, perhaps
then we can speak.{x"

Greetings all across Ansalon!
 
I, High Templar Tyrail Alaraeon, have, from this point forth, initiated the recruiting process! Have you wished you were sided with the light? Ever want to be that Knight, but the Solamnics just weren't for you? Are you pious, and willing to spread the Light across the Darkness?
 
If you answer "Yes" to any of these questions, you may yet have a place within the Holy Order of the Stars! Failure does not result in execution, unless specifically deemed necessary by the High Templar. Any who fall to Darkness will be excommunicated and given to the Legion for food. Does this not dissuade you? Send your note in to the High Templar now! (note to Tyrail)
 
Signed,
High Templar Tyrail Alaraeon,
White Lion of the Holy Order,
Former Knight of the Rose and previous Grandmaster of the Solamnic Knighthood,
Purveyor of Holy Relics,
Sacker of Neraka
(Yes this is to be taken with a grain of salt, but the actual message applies! Send your notes in now! Or be executed and excommunicated. Tyrail wills it.)

It's funny that you mention that now, actually. I was thinking about making a new character and going with a good clan, but I wanted a thief.. I asked paladine personally how he felt about a solamnic thief and he said auxilary only, and stuff. I've seen thieves in there before, but whatever.. Then I thought about the holy order, as long as I am bringing light and fighting evil, it's not strict. 
I ended up saying screw it and decided id go theives clan / hiddukel, because zodan has been sitting around for a year as a mishakal follower, unable to even find a holy order person to talk to. Because of the planning for the hiddukel thing, I have fallen in love with the whole concept of never killing but taking important posessions of enemies. like, I'd go to the mountain and take their weapons, either in RP with a note, or in person. id have conditions for their return, or something to that effect.
Point being, would the holy order turn a blind eye to me screwing with evil people a bit, or not? id love to play a good character again, but not if i cant have any fun with it lol.
Oh, and we need to rp about Zodan sometime, I'll send a note on him. I knew both of the old leaders, aiyre and talana, and I got their "approval" but they were gone by the time I was ready to go in.

I am sorry that this note is quick and short to the point.  While writing this I am dealing with home matters and getting ready to log out.
I would like to ask that if you are a member, and of course I guess you would be if your reading this, to send a note back about activity.  It is about time that the clan starts to get back in shape, and we start doing role play diligintly.  Please, if possible just let us know you're still around, and when you are able to be around.
This way, we can try and set roleplays up between us all, and start spreading the word of the Order.
Thank you,

**A man in black robes stumbles in your direction, blistered and cruedly warped hands grab at you.  The man coughs viciously, spittle spraying you.  Gaining his strength, he cackles wildly and runs off, leaving parchment in your hands**
 
{DGreetings to all of those in Krynn that are fortunate to receive this letter,
Those who have once trembled at the mention of the Dark Order, now seem to think we have been absent in the world.  You have thought that we became nothing, that along with the Dragon Armies, that we too fell back!  You thought for a moment, you could stop worrying?  You hear that the War has been over, and you believe this to be true!  Hear me now, the Dark Order is still here, we are forever strong. We will be feared, we will be known to you all.
The pestilence may slow its course, the plague cured for only a moment, but it never dies.  It continues to grow, it continues to become stronger, waiting for its time to strike again, to cripple the forces that wish the rid itself of it. Just like the illnesses you forever fight, so you shall forever fight the Dark Order, and like those illnesses that you can not truly conqure, nor shall you conqure teh stomp out the Dark Order.
Our faith grows forever stronger,  our churches grow larger, our might unstopable!  Just remember you insolent fools, that are blinded by lies, no matter what you do, no matter how much you fight. We will forever be here.  You may build walls, we will crumble them to dust.  You can grow your crops, our locust will devour them.  You may cure diseases and other illnesses, but we will strike ever stronger, ever more diligintly.{X
 
**The letter ends, and its notices theres another attached to it**
 
{RHear my call, brothers and sisters of the Dark.  Hear it, and come to us my flock.  You are followers of the Shadows, you know the truth in the world.  You know that no matter what anyone does, no matter how much the light fights to make things "good" that there is always evil.  There will always be greed, death, murder, pestilience.
 No matter how much they wish it to a lie, it is the truth.  Those with fat pouches, will continue to have those pouches grow, and those with no food in their bellies, will continue to starve.
You know the truth they try to hide from the eyes of the land.  Come to us followers of all evil paths, we may take different roads, but it will all lead to the same place.  Warriors of Greed, Knights of Hate, come swear your shields and blades to us, guard our Order with your life, and great rewards will be given to you.
Priests's and Priestesses of the Shadows, come to our halls once again, come and share the teachings of your Dark Gods and goddesses! Empower us with your dark insights, bless our dark warriors and our dark cause.
Dabblers of the Dark Arts, come hither and lend us your dark magicks! Empower blades with darkness and death, show the world we can not die! Come to our halls, we are open to you; come and and teach your art to those can learn.
No one else understands the price you pay, no one else understands your motives.  You are not honored the way you should be honored.  Come my flock to our doors, and I promise you greatness in our Order.  Come, and spread the word of the Dark Gods!{X

A relaxed and familiar prayer is sent. You know many things of this boy from previous prayers and observations. He was abandoned by his traitor of an undead mother and left floating to his slow death in the blood sea. He was picked up by some followers of yours, the Mahkwahb elves. Seeing promise in this young man, the elves raised him as one of their own; teaching him the ways of Maelstrom, as she was called in the blood sea.
 
The most important lesson learned from them is simply thus: Live the way you want, take what you want, do what you want; let those who are helpful be rewarded, let those who oppose you feel your wrath.
 
{gMaelstrom, I have recently ventured from the sea in hopes of finding what else lies outside. It's pathetic, in my opinion, almost everywhere I go there is mindless creatures doing mindless things. Holding their tongue and sword to save face or because another said they should? These "people" are not people, they seem to care little for their own free will. Had I been closer to home, I'd have brought some of their parts back for shark food. 
 
I find myself compelled to bring freedom to these creatures. Either by death or by learning, they should all come to understand the ways that you have taught me. There is a group, they call themselves the blackorder. They've been rather boring lately, but the stories of their activities leads me to believe that they are simply waiting and planning. I want in on the fun! Though my idea of fun is on the dark side, surely it would be seen that over here, in the storm, is where one can truly be free.
 
{xAs though magically imprinted, there is a still image attached to the thought of this boy. The image of the raging storm marked on his body.

Dargonas: Entrance to the Sacred Dark
Fri Jun 28 13:17:43 2013
To: Blackorder
Greetings, my fellow brothers and sisters of the Dark!
May Morgion the rolling black engulf your enemies, may he have them writhe in pain and agony, their eyes bleed tears!
 
I am Dargonas Blackbreath, and I seek entrance to this sacred order.
I come from the forests, or I did once, and once I lived with a tribe, revered as a sacred one, one touched by their gods.
And maybe once I was touched by my peoples Gods. I cured the sick, I fed the hungry and gave those who needed it the sweetness of water.  Those who were close to death, I helped them.
But a plague had hit our tribe, one I never seen before.  It came from no where, we had not been in contact with no other tribe, or traveler for a while.
I tried to save them, I tried to alleviate their pain, I tried to give them hope.  My tribe was a ver large one, over sixty adults, and fourty children. Yes, we were a very large tribe, a tribe that prospered because of me. I was their light.
Every one of them died before my eyes when I tried to heal them. I failed every time to remove the plague from them, I failed every time to understand the sickness, I gave up hope in the gods.  It was then, when I was crying in frustration as I held my dying mother in my arms, I couldn't save her, I was a failure.  I gave up at that moment, I forsaken Mishakal right there, may she rot in an everlasting agony! She killed my tribe!
It was in that moment, while I cried to the heavens that I'd do anything anything to see my mother live, that a darkness seemed to roll over me, my hands burned and my body began to wrack in pain, <THE MUST ALL DIE, MY CHILD. THIS IS HOW IT IS. ALL THINGS PERISH, DISEASE IS EVERLASTING.> I felt the heat in my hands radiate, they became hotter and hotter, and I felt the plague leaving my mother quickly dying body.
<I WILL HELP YOU. BUT I PROMISE THIS, SHE MUST DIE AS IT IS FOREVER CERTAIN.> The darkness in my mind shuddered, <I WILL GIVE YOU THE POWER. I WILL GIVE YOU A MOMENT WITH HER, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!>
My breath left me, yes! The plague was leaving her body, but it wasn't gone. It was entering my own body, its new vessel.  My body writhed in pain and agony, I screamed to the heavens, and all I got in return was laughing.  I still remember after that, my body was left completly different, a host for disease, forever scared by my deal I made with The Great Lord Morgion that day.
 
Well, my mother did live, and after a moment, my pain subsided.  My mother smiled weakly to me, "Find a new tribe, Dargonas, you must help others, if this get out there, you can save them...." her eyes were fading, "You saved me...bless Mishakal" I shook my head, and kissed my mothers forhead, "No, mother, Mishakal, curse her! She killed you!" A blood tear dropped down on my mother, and her face was horrified. 
"I'm sorry, mother."  I knew what to do, I knew his price to my new found power. I had to sacrafice the one I loved to keep it, or surely I would parish myself.  I opened my mouth and blew into my mothers face, a black cloud of what seemed like locust engulfed her body, and there I sat watching her body rot and decay.
 
I left the tribe, their corpses rotting away. It was time to move on. I found a new tribe in the forests not far from Qualinost.  They accepted me in, thinking I was a blessing from once again, Mishakal.  Though, I wore black robes, they were robes of a cleric, and I wore a turqoise medallion(though it wasnt a relic of Mishakal) they took me as hers.
They welcomed me, and then it happened. The tribe went to war with another tribe, raids happened. And many of my new tribe were taken, or raped and murded. Or just plain murded.  They begged me for help, but I didn't want to. I still had trouble accepting my new found power, I didn't know how to use it and keep it a secret.
The war raged on, and the peoples of the forest knew of my power, I made fires of the heavens strike, I made the earth shake and tremble with just a few words.
The rival tribe trembled, but they didn't stop. And sadly, there were only a few of us left of my kind in the forests.  Taking only a couple of swords for backup, I snuck with them to the rival camp. 
I looked down on the tribe with a satisfaction, I reveled in what was to come.  Telling them to move behind me, the two obeyed.  Sucking in a deep breath, I opened my mouth wide and release, a cloud of the darkest black of diseased locust flew down to the tribe.
Men and women, children and elderly all cried out in the night, they ran out of their tents, they clawed their eyes, their faces maked with pocked disease and death. I muttered a prayer to Morgion, and left with my two swords back to our tribe.
Mutters were heard, I was then being called Blackbreath, and that was when my tribe started to relaize I was different, they finaly noticed my skin and my eyes.
When I was about to take off, and leave this tribe in death, terror struck at us all. We were ambushed by our cousions of Qualinesti, and knights in black armor.  We were rounded up, and shoved into caged wagons, "Slaves" they called us. I was no slave! I was the Blackbreath, I was only owned by one, and that was my Dark Master.
These new men noticed my skin, my eyes, tinged yellow, looking diseased.  Others in the cages, muttered "Blackbreath" "The eyes of death!"  The Qualinesti and the dark knights puzzled at this one.  Finaly, they wrangled me up, and demanded answers, "Why do they say this?!" they looked at me in disgust, "Why have they let you live this long?"

Well, how Tyrail runs the Holy Order, and how he ran the Knighthood are similar, in the scheme of things, the issue'll be building it up properly so I can have it where I just did general management like I used to. That being said, Tyrail understands a vast difference between killing, protection, and harassing. Some things he's willing to overlook entirely, other things he'll let slide depending on the circumstances, and on others he'll squash pretty quick.
 As far as messing around with evil, harassing, spreading misinformation, spying, usual thief/rogue work. He would tolerate some, and advocate others. Any specifics can be Role-Played out, and further negotiated and discussed. I'm open to the idea, and the Holy Order does have a militant arm within it, that isn't nearly as disciplined as the Knighthood, or even the Auxillary, per se. Think the Knights Templar, with slightly different standards and motives. :)

<I WILL HELP YOU. BUT I PROMISE THIS, SHE MUST DIE AS IT IS FOREVER CERTAIN.> The darkness in my mind shuddered, <I WILL GIVE YOU THE POWER. I WILL GIVE YOU A MOMENT WITH HER, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!>
My breath left me, yes! The plague was leaving her body, but it wasn't gone. It was entering my own body, its new vessel.  My body writhed in pain and agony, I screamed to the heavens, and all I got in return was laughing.  I still remember after that, my body was left completly different, a host for disease, forever scared by my deal I made with The Great Lord Morgion that day.
 
Well, my mother did live, and after a moment, my pain subsided.  My mother smiled weakly to me, "Find a new tribe, Dargonas, you must help others, if this get out there, you can save them...." her eyes were fading, "You saved me...bless Mishakal" I shook my head, and kissed my mothers forhead, "No, mother, Mishakal, curse her! She killed you!" A blood tear dropped down on my mother, and her face was horrified. 
"I'm sorry, mother."  I knew what to do, I knew his price to my new found power. I had to sacrafice the one I loved to keep it, or surely I would parish myself.  I opened my mouth and blew into my mothers face, a black cloud of what seemed like locust engulfed her body, and there I sat watching her body rot and decay.
 
I left the tribe, their corpses rotting away. It was time to move on. I found a new tribe in the forests not far from Qualinost.  They accepted me in, thinking I was a blessing from once again, Mishakal.  Though, I wore black robes, they were robes of a cleric, and I wore a turqoise medallion(though it wasnt a relic of Mishakal) they took me as hers.
They welcomed me, and then it happened. The tribe went to war with another tribe, raids happened. And many of my new tribe were taken, or raped and murded. Or just plain murded.  They begged me for help, but I didn't want to. I still had trouble accepting my new found power, I didn't know how to use it and keep it a secret.
The war raged on, and the peoples of the forest knew of my power, I made fires of the heavens strike, I made the earth shake and tremble with just a few words.
The rival tribe trembled, but they didn't stop. And sadly, there were only a few of us left of my kind in the forests.  Taking only a couple of swords for backup, I snuck with them to the rival camp. 
I looked down on the tribe with a satisfaction, I reveled in what was to come.  Telling them to move behind me, the two obeyed.  Sucking in a deep breath, I opened my mouth wide and release, a cloud of the darkest black of diseased locust flew down to the tribe.
Men and women, children and elderly all cried out in the night, they ran out of their tents, they clawed their eyes, their faces maked with pocked disease and death. I muttered a prayer to Morgion, and left with my two swords back to our tribe.
Mutters were heard, I was then being called Blackbreath, and that was when my tribe started to relaize I was different, they finaly noticed my skin and my eyes.
When I was about to take off, and leave this tribe in death, terror struck at us all. We were ambushed by our cousions of Qualinesti, and knights in black armor.  We were rounded up, and shoved into caged wagons, "Slaves" they called us. I was no slave! I was the Blackbreath, I was only owned by one, and that was my Dark Master.
These new men noticed my skin, my eyes, tinged yellow, looking diseased.  Others in the cages, muttered "Blackbreath" "The eyes of death!"  The Qualinesti and the dark knights puzzled at this one.  Finaly, they wrangled me up, and demanded answers, "Why do they say this?!" they looked at me in disgust, "Why have they let you live this long?"

I smiled, and once again sucked in my breath and released. My captors feel dying in pain, and I left them, and my so-called tribe to die. I would find a safe haven, Morgion would lead me the right way.

I know we share a shady lifestyle, and many may have fallen to this as a result of some sob-story of a life. Quiet the contrary, I live like this because I enjoy it. I enjoy bending others to my will, using my wit, to get what I want. While, if you had seen me in public, I put forth this image of an innocent and weak little girl, it is simply a means to an end.
 
I am driven by many things to continue to game this system of ours. Steel, knowledge, and power are all things that interest me. I broker information that I aquire, if it stands to benefit me to do so, and often times start conflicts which did not exist to begin with- nothing more is more profitable than being seen as a needed asset by one who is desperate.
 
Alas, I disgress, I am not one to sell myself with words on paper. While I can talk others in circles, writing down true facts about myself is something I am not accustomed to. I know that I was seen placing this message, seek me out and learn what you need; for I seek to join and climb your ranks as a brother, or sister, of the shadows.

Fellow Immortals - 

It has come to my attention that a recent event has transpired where one
of our newly "re-joined" Immortals has already deleted; only one day after
creating.  I'm not going to name anyone here.  The intent of this note isn't
to pass judgement or punishment, rather to point out an example of something
I'd rather not see.  It's not just that a person deleted their Immortal
character, it's for the reason that they deleted that I don't care for.

Folks... I know some of you like to police each other; telling others who
may be subordinate to you, how you would like them to do something.. or 
what you expect out of them, etc..  There's only one person on this MUD who
should be making those kinds of calls.  It's not a matter of trust, but
rather a simple matter of command structure.  Personally, I trust everyone
here.  I trust that everyone has the ability to make good decisions and
acts out in the best interest of the MUD.  However, putting expectations
onto others is not what anyone here should be doing besides myself.  It
can be confusing to others, can create conflicts between yourself and
your fellow staff members, and can also lead to people doing things like
what had happened here where they delete their Immortal.

If you have any issues, concerns, complaints, etc. about your fellow
Immortals, please come see me.  Then perhaps we can all sit down together
and go over those.  I've had other Immortals come to me in the past who
had quit in a similar manner as this because they felt threatened; that
during a time when I wouldn't be on, the other Immortal would come down
hard on them.  We don't want this kind of environment; even if your
intentions are meant to be good.

Thank You,

Hiddukel

{xA short but humble prayer rings in your ears, from a new devotee named Eulicia. It simply said, "{DMay the broken scales favor me this day, lining my coinpurse with steel, and my mind with secrets.{x" You find this amusing, despite its simplicity. While only recently devoting to your ideals, you've known of the womans lust for trickery since a small child. She was born a noble; by no means did she need to use others or steal for the necessities in life, but she did regardless out of pure estasy. 
 
She grew bored of tricking the commoners in her village, stealing items and placing blame on those she disliked, and learning and exchanging the secrets of anyone and everyone. She opted, instead, to venture out, to see what fun was awaiting her in Ansalon. She quickely formed a double life, becoming Maria, an honest and harmless traveling peddler, and Eulicia, a cold trickster hellbent on causing as much havoc as possible- and taking advantage of it to line her own coinpurse. 
 
While she has never taken a life, she is not afraid of conflict, often times leaving the poor victim with no worldly possessions, and with her face being known and respected as an honest business-woman, she is never suspected. Never the religious type, she avoided temples and texts unless needed for a transaction. However, backally talks about 'the Betrayer', lord of greed, peaked her interest to the point of seeking out more information. 
 
Not long after, you felt it as she devoted to you at your altar, though the symbol be not etched into her skin as to remain anonymous. While it is not needed, she seeks your blessing in her deal-making, and hopes one day to be of more service, and to that end she left a note on the hidden steel entrance of the Thieves Guild for all of your followers to see. 
 
OOC: Just a brief over-view of what I've figured out for Eulicia so far, as far as background and such. I didn't want a long, drawn out, cliche, reasoning for her lifestyle; instead I like the idea of doing it -simply- because it's enjoyable to her. Hope this gives some kind idea as to what kind of player she will be.

Here is a story about a kender, a kender who like all kenders didn't fear anything, it just isn't part of their nature.
 
Tullywynk Lightfingers was a happy kender by right, and why shouldn't he be?  He was stricken with wanderlust three years ago, and left Kenderhome far behind, ready to take on the world of Krynn.  There were a lot of things for him to experience, that was for sure!  He heard many stories during his time at Kenderhome.
His mother and father settled down after a long time of adventures, and not long after that; they met each other, reliving old stories and excitments that happened to them in their lives, they ended up falling in love, and it wasn't long after that they got married.  Then, they embarked on their greatest adventure!  They had a child, Tullywynk.
Now after Tullywynk was born, they soon realized that having a child was a different experience for them both, neither of them had done this before, but even for great adventueres like them, Tullywynk was something else.
Now see, Tully was not the average kender, at the time he hit five years a bit of wanderlust hit him right in the behind, and the young kender was already off!  He would dissapear in a blink of an eye if you didn't watch him closely; and there were many mishaps with the boy.  Already he was 'finding' things, as was his birthright, he just couldn't help himself, things just got lost, or he would just stumble upon something that was interesting.
There were many times while growing up, that Tully had "stumbled" into the Mayor's home, and had found items of interests(that the Mayor himself had "found" long ago) and his parents and the residents of Kenderhome were shocked that this young kender just couldn't hold still, shocked that he could always find their missing belogings.
 
The years went by for Tully, and his sense for adventure grew more, and he would be found doing the most dangerous things, now mind you that Kender don't fear anything at all, so to them it was dangerous, but to someone not accustomed to this advantage, they were -very- dangerous.  His parents knew, that this son of theirs would be something else, that he would one day leave home and then he would be able to exasperate his pent up energies.
Now, once a year all of the Lightfingers who werent residing in Kenderhome would make the trek back, to see their family.  And what an amazing reunion it was for Tullywynk!  He heard so many stories of the outside world, and every year those stories changed and grew more fascinating!
He heard stories from Liches to great warriors who couldn't do anything without the map of a Lightfingers' help.  From a Knight who kept losing his precious medallion,  to poweful wizards that would guard his belonings and giving warning of being turned into a mouse or a toad!
 
Those stories sure did make Tully think about things outside his home, and when he came to the age of leaving, he was so excited, that grabbing his many pouches, his maps that were given to him by family members, and his hoopak he left home, forgetting to say goodbye to all.
 
Tully had a great many adventures, from sneaking into the mountains of Thorbardin to escaping guards of Palanthas, that he knew then and there, that there was nothing he couldn't do!  That is, untill the life-taking day he stumbled into a Mages home.
Now Tullywynk didn't know it was the home of a mage, now he should have maybe noticed somethings, like the interesting books or the numerous phials and scrolls.  Or even the scent of rose petals and bat guano.  But, his mind wasn't on those kinda things.  He was more preocupied with the things he had found; a jewel encrusted dagger on a table, three magical rings(he had hoped they were!) that were left in a drawer(how barbaric), and a wand that was in what must have been the Wizards' study.
That moment changed his life forever, not paying attention to his surroundings, he heard a loud cough; looking at the door to the study stood a man in Black Robes, <The Wizard! I should let him know his lock was broken, he will want to get that fixed!>  Tully smiled nonchalantly at the man, "{Chullo! A good thing your back, I was traveling, and I seemed to have gotten lost! I found this place, well its your home, but you know that..."{X
He ignored the obvious anger on the mage's face, "{CWell, I was hoping to get some help, since well, apparently this place isn't on my map..."{X  The mage enterd the room and said something pretty mean about kenders; Tully was gonna have to talk about manners with him, that was no way to talk to a guest!  <Oh, his lock! Manners will have to wait!>
"{CWell, that was mean... but that will come later, your lock is obviously broken, I went to knock and well, the door opened-"{X Tully seized to talk, mage had magicked him! <Now this is fun! I never been magicked before..>  One moment he saw things normal, the next everything was upside down, which wasnt good for his pouches since everything spilled out.  "{COh, now that is just not good! My maps will surely get all mixed up now!"{X
The mage snarled as he saw many of his own personal belognings with those maps and other items the kender must have stolen from others most unfortunate to cross paths with him, "{RTHIEF!"{X He hissed, and with a wave of his wand threw Tully; which landed him agaisnt a wall.

"{CNow that is just not nice! I am not, and never have been a thief, you.. you...you bat poop for brains bookworm!"{X  Tully continued with his rant, and the mage had enough of this creature.  Another wave of his hand and a sharp hiss of a language of magic, a fireball hurled at the kender. <ummm...> but the rest of whatever he had been thinking ceased.  Falling in darkness, that seemed to be an eternity, the Kender arrived in the world of the dead.
He couldn't tell how much time went by, if time did ever go by in this sort of place, but it was too long! And too boring!  There was nothing to do, no one to talk to, all he had was himself, and well telling stories to yourself isn't that much fun after awhile.  There was nothing to explore, nothing exciting to find, it was a kender's worst nightmare!  He just wanted to go home, he wanted to be back on the road, and he wanted to talk to that mage about how rude he was!

Hey Hidd,
 
I didn't want to try to deal with this myself, so I just
made a couple of notes and wanted you to be aware of them.
I approached Morgion about his mortal character that is
devoted to his immortal, and this is what ensued:
 
You tell Morgion 'Hey hun, I know you're in a bad spot tonight, but I don't think you're allowed to have a mortal character devoted to your immortal'
 
You tell Morgion 'I just wanted to give you a heads up, because there are others who might get on to you about it, and I don't want it to be because you didn't know better'
 
Morgion tells you 'K..been wanting talk to Hidd it's for Rp purpose and story progression. But if they through a fit fine then I will cancel the Rp till I talk to Hidd about it. But As of now this a test run really..'
 
You tell Morgion 'All right, just letting you know. Someone other than me has noticed, and you may want to lay low until you know for sure its okay -- but it is your RP'
 
Morgion tells you 'really at this point idc. I've been running story's for awhile am tired of treated like I don't matter.. So I'm doing this test if dont like it then they can bitch.'
 
 
Sorry it's not very pretty looking... Anyway, that's all

Members of the Holy Order,
 
Henceforth, the Holy Order will be divided into three groups, based on intent, not class or merit.
 
The Militant arm of the Holy Order is now the Knights Templar. Protectors of the innocent, and the aggressive arm of good. The Knights seek to turn or remove evil in all it's forms, while still understanding that a balance must be maintained. I, myself, am the High Templar. Below this, are the Lord Templars, Templars, and Templar Acolytes.
 
the Evangelical arm of the Holy Order is the Seekers. They seek to spread the word of the Light to all corners of Ansalon, and to convert and guide all whom seek assistance. NO ONE will be denied aid. So as we give to our friends, we will also give to our enemies. Any who deny aid to those in need will answer to the High Templar. We are to spread why the Light is different from the darkness with good intent, not selective intent.
A High Priest of Mishakal, preferably, will run this arm of the Holy Order, but those whom deem themselves truly devoted shall be allowed to dictate sanctions, as well as the hierarchy, once one is found.
 
Lastly, the Inquisitors are the intelligence arm of the Holy Order. Those who choose to live in the shadows, gathering information, relaying tactical intent and strategy... occasionally even fulfilling the hard decisions made by the High Templar will fall into this arm. The High Inquisitor will lead, followed by Lord Inquisitors, Inquisitors, and Inquisitor Acolytes.
 
All who seek to gain entrance to the Holy Order are Petitioners, and will seek to prove their devotion to one of the three arms of the Clergy. Any whom succeed will become Acolytes under any given arm. Those who would normally be accepted, but have yet to decide under which arm of the Clergy to devote will be inducted, but remain as plain Acolytes until decision.
 
High Templar Tyrail Alaraeon,
White Lion of the Holy Order

It has been some time since you departed to resume your

that you allow him to stay with me, for without him...
Well, he just makes it so much easier on me.
 
I am worried about you. I will not deny it. I don't know
what you're feeling... I don't think I would be able to
truly relate, provided our differences... but if I were
to guess, I'd think you were still grieving for all that
you've lost. Perhaps not in the same way, but... from my
own experiences... Well, the point is that I'm truly
concerned. I've had a visit from Shimai... She told me that
you promoted her to Ordermistress, and that makes me so
happy for her. She has asked me to pay Wayreth a visit soon,
however, and I may do just that. But please, if you could
respond... If I can leave the Temple, I would want to be
able to see you as well. Please let me know.

Masters of the Conclave Tower in Wayreth,
 
This letter comes to your attention in the matter of renegades to your order.
Perhaps my main question in this missive is, 'what defines a renegade?'  I had
this evening come to find a black robed mage by the name of Rayo threatening the
boarderline -harmless- Aesthetics?  Not even half his strength?  In the -middle
of Palanthas-?  Forgive me for being frank but I do not remember anyone giving
members of the Conclave permission to threaten such passive citizens of Palanthas
as the Aesthetics?
 
Palanthas is a Solamnic owned territory, and I trust that its citizens that have
committed no crime against humanity won't be butchered for something so harmless as
a scholarly profession with as little or vast an understanding of the arcane they
may have.
 
I would like perhaps to have a better explanation of what becomes a gross, and I
persist on no little then gross, violation of the laws of magic.  I do not want the
people that tend to the libraries whom study magic to further their wisdom and their
knowledge to live in fear of the Conclavian boogeymen.
 
Signed with blessings from the Father of Dragons,
 
Gulgor Arestanadok,

Gulgor: Concern for Aesthetics
Thu Jul  4 21:02:50 2013
To: shimai yerthorn darkahn
Masters of the Conclave Tower in Wayreth,
 
This letter comes to your attention in the matter of renegades to your order.
Perhaps my main question in this missive is, 'what defines a renegade?'  I had
this evening come to find a black robed mage by the name of Rayo threatening the
boarderline -harmless- Aesthetics?  Not even half his strength?  In the -middle
of Palanthas-?  Forgive me for being frank but I do not remember anyone giving
members of the Conclave permission to threaten such passive citizens of Palanthas
as the Aesthetics?
 
Palanthas is a Solamnic owned territory, and I trust that its citizens that have
committed no crime against humanity won't be butchered for something so harmless as
a scholarly profession with as little or vast an understanding of the arcane they
may have.
 
I would like perhaps to have a better explanation of what becomes a gross, and I
persist on no little then gross, violation of the laws of magic.  I do not want the
people that tend to the libraries whom study magic to further their wisdom and their
knowledge to live in fear of the Conclavian boogeymen.
 
Signed with blessings from the Father of Dragons,
 
Gulgor Arestanadok,
Saint of Paladine,
Executor of the Solamnic Auxiliary

A nondescript scrap of parchment, folded in half, flutters to the ground
nearby.  There is nothing but a single word written on the front of it, in a
dark ink.  It reads: 
 
          {DHeron{X
 
Upon lifting the note, and opening it, a similar script inside reads:
 
{DThe Mahkwahb's name is Xinaesa. She will be awaiting you in Port o'Call.
She is destined for great things, in your care...
 
However, if I find any ill fortune has come to her, and that it was
in your power to avoid it...
I will hunt you and kill you myself.
 
In the name of the Maelstrom, I bid you safe travels.

A note is delivered to the Foresters clan hall via a strong healthy Eagle.
It is easy to tell that this is the Eagle the previous leader, Anavrin, had saved and trained before his demise. The note carried by the eagle is elegantly written cursive on fine parchment. A wax seal had been used, a symbol of the World Mother, a feather, imprinted into it.

Appearing within a sudden burst of ebony smoke is a perfectly white
scroll, wrapped and sealed with a wax signet of a skull holding a rose in
its teeth -- recognizable as the Kiralv emblem.  
 
Upon breaking the seal, the scroll reads:
 
'{DMiss Yancy,
 
I am aware of Theriss' actions against you and your
personal distaste for him. Therefore, I found it
necessary to inform you that he has not only resurfaced,
but apparently has regained sanity. You see, as I spoke
of earlier, he was driven mad by our "lost god."
 
He wishes to apologize to you, though I instructed him
not to -- and that I would forward his apologies.
Furthermore, he has abandoned the Queen, and been re-entered
into the Black Robes, where he will be carefully
watched.
 
If you wish to speak of this further, direct a missive to
Kalaman, where it will be forwarded to me.

Theriss DelRivian has abandoned the Knights of Takhisis and has

A bird with brilliant white feathers finds its way to deposit a piece of
parchment nearby.  Once its parcel has been delivered, it flutters away,
making its way to the tradewinds that will carry it home.  

The parchment itself is a fine quality, and it is a practiced handwriting
that states the recipient of the parchment on the front, devoid of the
flowery flourishes of the Silvanesti. The parchment itself is folded into
quarters, and unfolding it reveals the message that has been written within:
 
 
{yThe wind carried your voice to me. I hope this message finds you well,
Nidalee. I will be glad to meet you. My home is the forests surrounding,
Solace, where the Temple of Nature lies. I travel them often; should you
have a place you would like to meet, please advise me. Otherwise, Solace
is my typical choice for a meeting place. The Inn of the Last Home is an
easy place to find.
 
I am a Kagonesti of small stature. My hair is silver, and falls just to my
shoulders. For our meeting, I'll be in a set of dark green leather armor.
I hope this will help you find me -- no matter where we meet.

leveling wishes to RP back then that is fine.  Doing so does not make the
game fun for people whom are trying to level their characters or newbies
trying to learn the game.  If you want to be a level 100 (or in general high

If you want to talk, and have free time, give me a call. 
Hope to hear from ya. I got info that only you need to know. I can't discuss it with anyone else on this game because its difficult to hold a proper conversation with certain individuals within the LOK realm.
I got information. I wanna tell ya my side of the story, going back 3-4 years, in regards to certain situations and things Ive witnessed. And why I play my character the way I do. Just wish to clarify certain things. 
I've never approached you with all this because I thought it to be irrelevant, tiresome, and aggravating. While aggravating and tiresome, I suppose I now realize it is not irrelevant. 
This situation that has occurred, between certain individuals and myself I suppose, began years ago. 
Part of me never desired to go all out because I figured, this guy Hiddukel probably made this game years ago in his younger years. And probably looks at the politics and ins and outs of the game now as a burden. I do not wish to annoy, get under your skin. I just want ya to know what I know and see the situation from my point of view, incase I disappear again for a year or two because I'm being trolled.

Screaming is heard within the conclave halls, seemingly from Lunitari's altar atop one of the towers. Inside, a red robe is in a struggle, arcane distortions spewing from the cracks of the door. The mage is ravaged from what seems to be self-inflicted scars from head to toe. "{rMercy, Maiden, mercy! Save your humble servant from the chains that bind him!{x" the man shouts. The mentally ill mages prayer goes unanswered, his mind's battle for dominence never ceasing.
 
With the last bits of strength left in his body, he casts a simple spell of mirror. Four bodies appear, looking like the mage in every way. "{rPlease,{x" he whispers, his body failing as he loses conciousness. The room is filled with laughter as the torches shine an ominous red filling the room with blinding light. When the light dies down, the four mirrors stir. 
They seem to have gained a new appearances. First, there is a woman with long red hair, small waist, large bust, and wearing a kimono-style red robe. Second, a red haired muscley man wearing red plate armor. Third, a cynical looking man, having long black hair, grey robes, and houses similar scars to the original mage. The last of the ex-mirrors is the first to stand, a perfect mirror of the original except for the scars and seems to be a younger version, having smoother skin and more youthful eyes.
The original mage lay on the ground, scars gone. His mind sane and some energy restored, he stirs with the mirrors. When each of them reach their feet and gain some composure, there is an awkward silence as each looks about the altar. There is no question as to who each of them are, for they had fought inside the mages mind for so long. Each was given a nickname, however cliche they might have been, of {cFate{x, {yYang{x, {rRage{x, {mAffinity{x, and {CHonor{x.
It was not long before the casting of spells and the clashings of metal had begun. Screams, yelling, and a still-laughing voice can be heard from the tower. Corpses started to pile, only to become lifeless, stiff, then erode as all mirrors do. The battle came down to {mAffinity{x, a loving and beautiful mistress of illusions, {cFate{x the original mage himself, and {yYang{x the embodiment of his pain and darker thoughts. 
Rage had rushed in mindlessly only to be slaughtered, while Honor was backstabbed by Yang when he begged for protection. The mistress Affinity stayed calm, either hands hovering parallel to the ground in preperation of casting, eyes locked on the other two. Yang grinded his teeth in anger, glaring at the original mages body with bloody intent in his eyes. Fate was weary to fight, let alone engage, these two for he knew what they were capable of from when they had control of his mind. 
He backs up to a wall, placing a hand against it while watching the other two closely. He speaks a few words, a smile forming as a gate seems to form on the wall, though it is quickly shattered with an explosion.
An illusion fades, the mage standing in the center of the room. There was no wall behind him, no gate, only a sense of confusion as the mistresses illusion ceases to be. Only Yang, smirking with a hand on fate's back, stands behind him. Searing skin remains where the unscarred flesh on his back once was, the pain rushing quickely into his senses. He lets out a bloodchurning scream, dropping to his knees and panting. Yang marvels in his pain, for once it had not been placed on him. 
Affinity takes this chance to escape out of a gate. With a grit of his teeth and a growl, fate turns on Yang, plunging them both into a gate as well. The two appear in the sky just south of the temple of paladine in palanthas. Fate fell onto stone ground, while yang fell into the fountain, breaking his fall. Fate's target, his friend and high cleric, Sera, sits nearby... and such, the three aspects of Fyrah were released, each of them attempting to carry the same name.

They seem to have gained a new appearances. First, there is a woman with long red hair, small waist, large bust, and wearing a kimono-style red robe. Second, a red haired muscley man wearing red plate armor. Third, a cynical looking man, having long black hair, grey robes, and houses similar scars to the original mage. The last of the ex-mirrors is the first to stand, a perfect mirror of the original except for the scars and seems to be a younger version, having smoother skin and more youthful eyes.
The original mage lay on the ground, scars gone. His mind sane and some energy restored, he stirs with the mirrors. When each of them reach their feet and gain some composure, there is an awkward silence as each looks about the altar. There is no question as to who each of them are, for they had fought inside the mages mind for so long. Each was given a nickname, however cliche they might have been, of {cFate{x, {yYang{x, {rRage{x, {mAffinity{x, and {CHonor{x.
It was not long before the casting of spells and the clashings of metal had begun. Screams, yelling, and a still-laughing voice can be heard from the tower. Corpses started to pile, only to become lifeless, stiff, then erode as all mirrors do. The battle came down to {mAffinity{x, a loving and beautiful mistress of illusions, {cFate{x the original mage himself, and {yYang{x the embodiment of his pain and darker thoughts. 
Rage had rushed in mindlessly only to be slaughtered, while Honor was backstabbed by Yang when he begged for protection. The mistress Affinity stayed calm, either hands hovering parallel to the ground in preperation of casting, eyes locked on the other two. Yang grinded his teeth in anger, glaring at the original mages body with bloody intent in his eyes. Fate was weary to fight, let alone engage, these two for he knew what they were capable of from when they had control of his mind. 
He backs up to a wall, placing a hand against it while watching the other two closely. He speaks a few words, a smile forming as a gate seems to form on the wall, though it is quickly shattered with an explosion.
An illusion fades, the mage standing in the center of the room. There was no wall behind him, no gate, only a sense of confusion as the mistresses illusion ceases to be. Only Yang, smirking with a hand on fate's back, stands behind him. Searing skin remains where the unscarred flesh on his back once was, the pain rushing quickely into his senses. He lets out a bloodchurning scream, dropping to his knees and panting. Yang marvels in his pain, for once it had not been placed on him. 
Affinity takes this chance to escape out of a gate. With a grit of his teeth and a growl, fate turns on Yang, plunging them both into a gate as well. The two appear in the sky just south of the temple of paladine in palanthas. Fate fell onto stone ground, while yang fell into the fountain, breaking his fall. Fate's target, his friend and high cleric, Sera, sits nearby... and such, the three aspects of Fyrah were released, each of them attempting to carry the same name.

Towermaster,
 
I write to you on the subject of Yerthorn. Since his depart of the red tower
it seems that his actions have not been that of the best. Today he informed me
over the mental link that he may have gotten all conclave banned from the 
library in Palanthas. This was something I am sure we could have easy rectified
if it was not for his next action. It seems that he thought it best to take
matters into his own hands, using the Chaslor child as a tool. He in fact cast
upon her, and spoke for her. I am not sure if he just spoke for her in clan or
if he did more.
 
I have left him to you for punishment, as he has joined your tower. In my possession 
I have his spell books, those will be handed over to you upon your return.
I will be speaking with the young Chaslor, though I do assume you will wish to speak
to her as well.
 
As of now I have informed Yerthron not to have contact with the Chaslors as well
as to stay within your tower until you can further speak with him.

Players leveling need to be able to pay some kind of attention to their
characters.  There is no compromise with this.  If it is as simple as
setting up your aliases and triggers and letting them run in one window and
having something else run in another window then great.  However, that is
how it has to be.  You give a player permission to run a character leveling
process without needed to pay attention to the screen...  At that point you
should simply skip the middle man and have new characters roll as level 100
characters.  Moving on to my next point...  With video game technology the
way it is today, very few people a year come to a MUD as their game of
choice.  Some people that have no clue what they are doing.  Once upon a
time players would come as often as they would go but that is no longer the
case...  That said, you want to use PK..  An IC mechanic against players
that are leveling, which is an OOC mechanic?  And with what few characters
we do get these days you want to make it even more difficult to down right
bully them because PKing people that are leveling used to be your
"Pass-Time?"  And you think that it is bullshit that this isn't going to be
tolerated anymore?  Piss poor attitudes like that to people who are just
trying to advance their characters is the EXACT reason I instituted the ban
in the first place.  If that is how you think people should be allowed to
get their kicks then those people can do exactly what I stated in my first
note and go somewhere else in my opinion.

While traveling through the streets of Palanthas, you hear a loud enthusiastic female voice. Finding the source, you come across a stall with a woman merchant in front of it, shouting to the amassed crowd that had gathered.
 
"{mBut wait!{x" the woman shouts, "{mThere's more!{x" She pauses for a moment, gathering a handful of goods from the back of her stall. "{mWomen, have your men been failing to deliver on their half of the deal?! Come, get a potion of enlarge, slip a little into his drink! He won't notice the difference, but you sure will!{x"
"{mYou,{x" she says, motioning to a large man who towers above the crowd from the back, "{mHaving trouble fitting into your old armor, have your muscles grown too large to fit through the doorway?! Look no further! Potions of shrink!{x"
The woman thinks for a moment, then continues, "{mhaving problems with that loud annoying child of yours?! TA-DA{x" she shouts, unfolding a scroll of silence with a smile. "{mTonight you can sleep without interuption, just pick one up, it's cheap!{x"
"{mAre you, like myself, tired of that shit-tasting potions sold at that shop over there?{x" the merchant asks, motioning to Sooth-Tongue who know glares at her. "{mPills!{x" she adds, "{mTasteless, effortless, and just as effective. No more lugging around bags of potions, these tiny pills are much easier to pack around and use!{x"
The shouting continues for some time, many items being sold and shown off. There is a sign at the back of the booth, which blatantly says "I also offer many services, such as intelligence (you'd be surprised what a motivated merchant can find out!) and many other things, don't be afraid to ask, I don't bite! Unless I'm paid to. ;)"

*A crumbling parchment is posted in the Great Hall*
Greetings, Brothers and Sisters of our Order.  I bring you tidings and wish you all well, in your dark works for the Gods in the Shadows.
 
I have written this missive to you all, as a brother and in repsect.
I have been striving to bring the Order to greatness, as I know all of you have, for we all know that the world outside our dark halls have forgotten us and our Dark Lords.
And because of this, we need to show these fools that we are still here, that our Gods and Goddesses are still amoung us and them, we must bring them the truth of their foolish ways, and remind them not to underestimate our power.
 
It is with this, I am here to let you know, I have spoken to my own Diety, Lord of Disease, Masters of Plagues in prayer, and because of my steadfast faith he has given me a vision. A great vision.
I must continue his great works, and breath the foulness upon the world of Krynn, and I must speak to others in my faith and bring them in one accord.
It is my duty and my service, that I must do this.  For I must do everything in my own power to weaken the works of the foolish Mishakal, and remind the world that they may be able to cure disease, that they can try and hide from the plagues and pestilence, but that can only last for so long.  And soon, my Dark Lord will rise in full true power, and bring a terrible darkness upon this world.
 
My brothers and Sisters, the time is now, that I must go on a journey to give this message, it is my time to spread the diseased views of Morgion to all.  I will be in the halls, I will be avaibale for whenever needed, do not ever hesitate to call upon me in your own works.  But as I mentioned, I was given a great vision!
I will be starting The Church of Morgoin!  Within our own halls, this church will rest, and in my doing so, I have hopes to bring more followers to my church and to our halls as a whole.  The vision of the Black Order and the rest of the Gods will be in sight, and I will do what I can, but I owe my service and duties to Morgoin first and foremost.
I ask, this one thing, lend a hand to me when it is asked, and I will lend a hand (though it may be a diseased one) in return.  If you happen to meet a soul on your travels, that has his faith in this Church, to contact me.  They can and you can reach me through my dark agents.
 
I will return this favor to you all, for if I run into any soul who has faith in any of our Dark Gods, I will contact you, and I will guide them to you and your own halls.
Thank you,
Dargonas Blackbreath - The Emissary of Disease, High Priest of The Church of Morgoin.

A fine piece of parchment is placed next Dargonas', a mighty handprint can be seen imprinted into it; it seems the missive was hastily, and angerly, stamped into place.
{gSo it seems one of our own, Dargonas, has taken it apon himself to put his god above the good of the entire clan. Our preferences go without saying, indeed, however blatantly forming his own sect within the halls seems like going a bit too far. Of course my loyalty to the Temptress brought me here, Of course her Will be done first and foremost, but to have the audacity to scew the orders favor in your personal direction is appaling.
Form your church, but it will not be alone. I've seen my godesses followers within the halls and, though it may be unjust, I am the strongest amoungst them and will rise up to represent her. Should one of her Seawolves that is stronger than I appear, it will be his right not my own. This is our way.
I do this not to split the order further, on the contrary I suggest that our name, 'the black order', be an umbrella term for each of our sects. Each will cooperate and work together for the same goals as before, nothing will have changed, but forming these smaller groups within will keep internal conflict down and reduce influence our religions have on each other. I would feel sorry for our halls if one tried to steal away one of the tempresses children.
This is not a request. This is not a power play. If the Church of Morgion insists on existing, the temptresses children within the halls will also conspire amoungst ourselves. Try to refuse us this right while boasting it for yourself would not be wise. I will be waiting for your answer, Dargonas.{x
The missive is topped with a messy signature which seems to be nothing more than a water-strain at the bottom, though words are made out. "Seawolf Heron - Wrath of the Temptress"

**Another crumbling missive is posted on the wall, placed next to the
fine parchment, the decay seeming to spread off of it** Dear Brother Heron,
I have written this in response to your own missive.  Brother, it was not in
disrespect to the Order itself, not to the Temptress and her Seawolves, nor
to any other Dark Gods and followers in our halls.  Yes, I have founded The
Church of Morgoin, but do not get me wrong Brother Heron!  I am here for the
Order overall.  I will help the order progress and make a stand.  I will
though, lead my Church.  Let us face it, we are one Order, yes!  But we have
many different faiths!  It would not be right for me to lead any or give
consoule to any that followed Zeboim, not would it be right for anyone of
another God give consoule to a soul of Morgoins.  This is why I went and
founded my Church, not in seperation, brother!  But to make us stronger, let
us deal with our own faith accordingly within our own confines.  But may we
join together to take care of the matters of our Order as whole!  When it
comes to dealing with the wretched fools on the outside, we band together! 
But when it comes to punishment of another, may it be by one from the same
faith.  I know, brother, you would not appreciate it if my 'diseased' tongue
reprimanded one of the Temptress' children.  Nor would I like it if you came
to reprimand one of the followers of Morgoin.  Go ahead, Brother Heron, form
the Seawolves!  Bring order and structure to the followers of Zeboim!  Make
yourselves stronger, as I will do the same with my Church, and then we can
become stronger all together!  Again, it was never to seperate our Order,
and I should have allowed more insight.  Let us not fall into turmoil, let
us band together and make the world fear us!

Alright, so I'm not sure how to word this all in this note.  So I am going to just be short and bried, and hope to get a response from you guys on what you think, and if it is acceptable.
For a better form of RP, which it had struck up a decent note posting icly, on the matter, The Black Order has broken up into sections.
Now, the Order will still be the Black Order, just with three different factions.
Now since there are TWO immortal Leaders, there is The Church of Morgoin, and the Seawolves of Zeboim.  Plus a third faction, based for those who follow different gods, IE: Sargonnas, Takhisis, Hiddukel, Chemosh, etc.
The idea is that each faction would have one mortal leader, and those leaders will govern the clan together, as mortal leaders. But also govern their own faction as seen fit, due to rp and how that faction would work.
This way, it opens more rp in the clan, maybe tensions rising, ploys being made.  OR a certain faction doing something different that the others, or something the others do not know.
If you would like the notes from Heron and I, I can get them to you, unless you can already see them.

1) I suggest we watch Chislev too. She snoops EVERYONE. She seems to not like Sirrion too much from what I have seen. She is ALWAYS snooping Zeboim yet says Zeb knows that she is snooping her. I found that odd.
2)Mishakal needs to be deleted on the forums so the current Mishakal can create her account for you.
 
3) I deleted my 101's so I could make Esmeralda and Elmindreda to spark some rp. This way no one says I was using my powers in the wrong way. So if anyone comes to you are aware of what I did.
 
4) Sirrion and I, debated on a point of view for rping. I had informed him that Esmeralda was going to be Hiddukel's child. He said that was against the books. Techincally, we never saw the gods having kids in the books which I agree with him on. However, we need to spark some rp and I think that if each god wants to take a player and 'sponser' them. With the roleplay I have planned over the next six months it could be fun for them. Ya know Dragonlance version of Percy Jackson or something. Yet I don't wa

enough to become a Legend?  We have over 20 races, over 10 classes, with
hundreds of spells and skills that have been tailored to suit each class! 
Come and check us out at: legendsofkrynn.wolfpaw.net:6100 
 
 
That's what I came up with, after minor edits. I apologize that I didn't
get it back to you before you logged for the night... I had some drama
on Facebook that I was taking care of at the same time haha.
Also, don't mind that the "We have over 20 races..." line got bumped up
to the end of the rest of the ad... I accidentally hit format heh.

Hi, I haven't really been active for a few years now, but I can admit you to the guild. It'd be nice to have a few active members again.
 
I'll try to log in a bit more for the next few weeks and see what you're up to.

then rolled up and tied with a pink ribbon.  Once it is untied and rolled
out it states the following.
 
Dear Silvaria,
I know it has not been long since we last spoke, but if it is possible I would like to speak again some time preferably tonight if possible.
Though.. I know this may be a little.. tough, What I wish to speak to you about I wish for the Towermaster not to know about.
If you do not wish to speak under those conditions I understand.. its hard to keep things from ones you love.

A piece of parchment comes by way of messenger bird, finding its way to
be dropped nearby. The cord that holds the parchment closed is a natural
fiber, and the parchment is rough compared to previous correspondence
that has come in this manner. Upon opening the parchment, a message is
seen inside. It reads:
 
 
{yMy friend,
I would welcome your company, though it worries me that you
must tell me something that you would rather Darkahn not know.
You seemed troubled during our last meeting. I hope it is not
the same thing troubling you now... It has been some weeks since
I last saw you.
 
I will have a good friend with me this eve. She has been absent
for quite some time, so I am catching up with her -- however,
she is trustworthy and loyal. She will also have no problem
stepping out during our conversation, should that make you more
comfortable.
 
You should be able to use the arcane to come directly to her.
Her name is Amalthea Mye.

A parchment has found its way to the desk, lying amidst other correspondence
to and from other folk. This one is familiar in its appearance, having been
tied securely with a piece of natural cord. Opening it will reveal a few
dried petals and leaves, seeming enough for a cup of tea. The fragrance of
the plant matter is soothing. The note can be seen written underneath the
leaves, as though she had purposely used it as an envelope to deliver the tea.
The note beneath reads:
 
 
{yMylove,
 
I hope you are well, and that the events you have spoken of have not
taken too deeply a toll on you. I would ask that we meet sometime soon;
I have a question for you concerning our son (how strange and thrilling
it is to write that... I am still in awe) and his tutelage. I do not
question your choice, but I think your decision may have damaged his
pride slightly. He came to me rather glumly after learning the news.
 
I have been so busy. There have been many travelers through the forests
as of late. I do not have the time I would like, nor that I thought I
would. I miss you.
 
Amalthea has returned to the Temple. She will be lingering for a time,
before leaving again on her journeys. She has the wanderlust of a kender,
I swear. I... do not know how you feel towards her. If you would rather
not encounter her, I can send word when she has quit the Temple. While
she is here, though, she tends to stick close to me...
 
Regardless, it will be a blessing to see you, if you can pull yourself
away from Wayreth for a short while. I look forward to hearing from you.
I love you.

Hey Team,
     I have some things to discuss with ALL of you. I think it is time for me to lay them down on the table. First, let me say I am so happy to see so many on the immortal team. I think we have some really REALLY strong people who can start bringing things back together to the mud. I think a few serious yet minor things need to be discussed amongst us. Hiddukel does not have the immortal board up yet, so notes will have to do.
 
First, the number of you who I see logged in and wizi invis. I understand you wish to go invis to watch rp, write notes, or handle clan matters. However, I see a number of you coming on and staying wizi for way too long. When new players log in, they feel a certain level of comfort when they see immortals visable. Your presence alone gives them that security that if they need help, they can come to you. I want the amount of time I see a number of you wizi invis or incog cut in half.
 
Second, the amount of Snooping I have been seeing with ALL of you. Those of you who have the command are not to use it to watch your friends. Hiddukel and I take the abuse of snooping very seriously. If you suspect a player doing wrong, then snoop them for a short while and then if they are not doing wrong, unsnoop them. I know a number of you are friends in real life and have informed me that you 'tell' the person your snooping when you do. However, the abuse of snooping lately has created a level of dis
trust amongst the Immortals and Mortals. They have had to resolve going to Skype or texting to have a conversation when they are playing our game. That is unacceptable. NO ONE here should have to feel that level of distrust that people are going to be watching them all the time that they do not want to play here because of it.
 
Third, the cheating. I have seen a few of you using your immortals to help your mortals. I watched this morning someone load an object, cast the gift spell, and send the 'gift' to their mortal. I will remind you that cheating of that level will get you gone. If you need to be reminded of what could get you in trouble.
PLEASE RE-READ HELP COMMANDMENTS
 
In conclusion, I do not want to have to lose any of you on this team. So, you all have a clean slate as of right now! There is a good and a bad to this clean slate. The Good: None of you lose your immortals today. The bad: If I see the continued abuse of your trust and power. The first offense, you will be demoted to 102. (Regardless of your current level)
The second offense, you will be removed from the team and loss of your immortal for a one year period to be re-evaluated by Hiddukel and/or Myself.
 
If you have any questions, or concerns with the above information. Please feel free to see Hiddukel or myself. Thank you for coming, please drive thru.

Hey, nice to hear from you. On a side note, I'm already in the guild and truemarked, but thanks for the offer. That aside some thieves guild rp would do wonders, like if you can set a goal for us or something. We have a few names that have been getting on lately. One new character, daughter of hidd. Me, cyrus, and someone else. None of them are as active as me, but that's not the point. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

Sitting atop a tree in your lair perches a young, but mighty, eagle. It is obviously the one saved and raised by Anavrin, once again delivering messages for his daughter Nidalee.
Tied to the eagles talon with a piece of hand-made cord is a hollow tube, inside a parchment is bundled. It reads:
{gWorld Mother{x, loving and sacred seed upon which the lands and seasons are born, I have saught out and talked with 'Silvaria' as you Willed. It did not take long for us to find a common goal and wish, as I was welcomed within the halls of the foresters.'
The people are gentle, yet resourceful. They live off the land, they take only what they need. Not so much from discipline as knights would be, but more from a love and respect of the world around them and their impact. I've come to love these members like family, just as it was meant to be - you family, one people, sharing this world for a short time.
It is from a love of this family, and of you, coupled with my original missions which have not staggered, that beckon this message. I seek guidance - I wish to serve in a higher degree. I don't want to simply live by what you represent, I want to enforce it, to help it grow. As my father before me, I simply lack whatever he had which compelled him to act independantly.
I don't claim to be any stronger or any more devoted than any of your followers. I wouldn't dare claim any superiority. I simply want to serve even more purpose than I have, for you and for everyone. If you have been seeking one, I hope you will consider myself as an option, for whatever you Will.

{xA prayer from a familar voice is heard, that of Zodan. Devoting at a young age, there is not much of the young man that you don't know. He has remained a pacifist follower of yours for a long time and travels alongside caravans set out from the holy order to areas that are in need. While never having the chance to meet a representative and join their ranks, he offered his time up knowing he would gain nothing.
Lately, however, you have become very upset with the young man. He had fallen for a young female cleric within the holy order ranks. It was not long that she had shown signs of being pregnant, but this was not the problem. The woman, though under the surface, was full of some rather dark thoughts and ended up giving into those thoughts- joining the undead legion.
She begged Zodan to join her, but no matter what words she used, he refused. His refusals weren't pure of heart, however, and you knew this. The young female, Amilia, placed a curse on your follower, one that eats at his soul and attempts to corrupt it. He didn't pray for help, he didn't alert anyone, even after he knew it existed. Not wanting your blessing to cause harm to those around him, you cut off the cleric; leaving him unable to draw on your divine being.

{xOOC: Haiii Mish. This is just part of a larger rp thats been going on with zodan. You can choose to have a reply to it and do something, or not. That's completly up to you. Being 'officially' part of holy order or marked, after a lot of rp, would help him, but it's not a necessity for him to keep doing what he's doing, if that makes sense.

Hello Team,
    I hope your all having a great week. First, let me say thank you for keeping up with my requests on cutting down on snooping, being visable more, and working as a team. I have seen improvement and I appericate all that you are doing to keep up with that for me.
 
A little addition to my expectations, NO IMMORTAL will be allowed to use the protect command from this point on. This also means you will not set protect on any of your mortals either. The only one who really should be allowed to snoop any immortal is Chislev, Hiddukel or myself. If you are not doing anything wrong or cheating you should not have an issue with this request.
 
However, if you have an issue with this request you can come and see me, or Hiddukel at anytime. If you are concerned for 'private' conversations I would remind you that there is Skype and/or texting. If I catch any of you with PROTECT on yourself, or your mortals you will be bumped down to level 102.
 
Let's keep up the great work I have been seeing all of you doing. I know I appericate it and I know Hiddukel does as well.

However, the abuse of snooping lately has created a level of distrust
amongst the Immortals and Mortals.  They have had to resolve going to Skype
or texting to have a conversation when they are playing our game.  That is
unacceptable.  NO ONE here should have to feel that level of distrust that
people are going to be watching them all the time that they do not want to
play here because of it.

For those of us that have the commands, we have been given the level of trust
TO USE those commands, otherwise we would not have been promoted to a level
that can use those commands.
 
I hate to be that guy, but your two notes are conflicting as far as the SNOOP
command goes.  Again, also hating to be that guy, but to top it off you chased
off a player/immortal, not naming names, from playing this game due to the
level of distrust you are giving off with your notes, which is exactly the kind
of environment you told us not to set.
 
I know you've said this many times, but Legends of Krynn is not a business.  It
is a game.  Please stop setting a business environment for a game that we help
out with that we do not get paid for but rather volunteer to do.  If any of us
wanted Legends of Krynn to be a business I'm sure we'd all rather go back to
our jobs and get paid money for the hours we put in to it.

A serene hidden glade of Chislev, a true and pure example of nature's beauty, is used as the backdrop of this event. Many small forms of life can be heard, this place untouched by the progressing world. Everything seems to be alive, sometimes you swear the tree fidgets in place.
 
However, everything dies down. The chirping stops, the birds rest their wings, movement seems to cease save for around the middle of the glade. There, some movement can be seen, grass swaying away from a singular point, pushed aside from scattering bugs and the like, backing away. Everything seems to face the direction of the point, watching, waiting.
The ground shifts, you can see ripples forming, occasionally a small spot bulges outward then dies back down. It is as if the ground is boiling. After a few minutes, the top of a head seems to rise up out of the ground. The figure continues to rise, more features coming into view.
It is the face of Anavrin, a former leader of the foresters. Having died of natural causes, his death was mourned by those who knew and relied upon him, but understood and never questioned.

Greetings,
 
For whomever this letter reaches, I hope it reaches you well. And that Eli has blessed all your travels. My name is Tayven Larson. I am of Elven decent. I have studied in the arts of healing now for as long as I can remember.
 
I have both my parents alive today. Both became elders in our villiage. They encouraged me to persue this path. I am a devotee of Eli. I am currently in my fourty third circle of training. Life has treated me well so forgive me if this is not the longest application of them all.
 
I do bid you all good day and hope to hear from you son.
 
Sincerely,

{bGreetings,
My name is Alia, I am a follower of Nuitari, and am intrigued by the recent happenings near palanthas. I would like to speak to whomever knows anything about that, or Rann.
If any are willing to speak with me I would prefer them to not be a magic user but a cleric. I would like to learn something before being branded an enemy.
 
Many Thanks,

'When that tree reaches as tall as your father once stood.. You will know that you are more then ready to walk as the highest of mine. As you learn your path in these forests it will grow, your actions will lead to the growth or death of that seed.' These words rung through Nidalee's head for weeks. The seed had been planted near a natural spring inside the Forester clanhall, in the most fertile soil imaginable and crystal clear water and sun bathed it daily.
 
It, however, never grew. The druids frustration at this mystery drew her to watching it constantly. She never left the halls, she watched the unmoving ground while pacing around restlessly. The nearby eagle, secretly the transformed Anavrin, watches over her. Occasionally the eagle would voice itself, screeching at the druid to leave.
 
One day, while she sleeps on the ground nearby, her ears touch the ground. Small movements of insects are heard through her powerful senses, only strengthened by her profession. Normally, listening to the ground below her is a soothing form of meditation for the druid, making sleep easier. However, it was not the same this morning.
 
Nidalee's eyes snap open, sounds of wildlife cries ring through her ears, so loud that she is unable to hear anything else. She quickely throws herself away form the ground, ready for a fight, but when she looks around there is nothing there. Confused, the druid over time learns that the sounds are only heard when she touches her ears to the ground. Anavrin flutters his massive wingspan in place, indicating he's ready to go.
 
Melting into the ground as if one with the dirt, no trace of Nidalee is left within the halls as she was traveling to the source. Surprised by the distance, Nidalee forms her head out of the ground, looking around. 'Qualinesti? How could she hear something from that far away? It doesn't matter, leave that matter for later.' Moving on, she draws close to the source.
 
'Hunters?' she wonders, looking at a small handful of men staggering around drunkidly. There are some cages with small animals within behind the men, and in front of them some mutilated corpses. It was obvious that these men torted their kills, not cleanly killed them. Angered, Nidalee shows herself after changing shape into a strong wolf.
 
Snarling viciously at the men, she startles them. Not quiet being the easy prey as the others were. There was a standstill, but after a few moments the men fled to safety, catching a road to town. Pleased, but still upset, Nidalee changes back to her normal shape and walks towards the corpses. "{DAhh,{x" a hidden voice says, "{DI knew those babbling bafoons would bring me one of the beasts wilf furies, and here you are.{x"
 
Her spear being picked up from the ground, Nidalee crotches low and scans the area. 'No one should be able to hide here, not from her,' the druid thought. "{DI hope the beast has more to offer. We will see each other again soon. Farewell.{x" the voice says, echoing into the distance slowly.
 
Some time passes, Nidalee unable to figure out the mystery or find tracks, she returns home. The only ease to her worried mind is the sight of a small sprout, the size of a toothpick, peaking out from the ground above the seed. A single leaf the size of the stem itself is shown, a healthy green color. She wonders what kind of tree will be grown. The only way to find out was to continue doing her work, in both small and large ways.

Subject *** New Rules for Mercenaries ***~
Text
Hey everyone.  I'm your new fearless leader and contracting officer.  I'm
going to lay down a few rules for being a successful mercenary.  (OOC: These
are currently placeholders and I'll have something more concrete in place
once I meet with Sarg). As of right now, all prior contracts are null and void.

1. All new contracts must be made through me. No exceptions. I will contract
the Mercenaries out as a whole guild and offer jobs (contracts) to all
members of the guild.

2 Bounties are fair game to any mercenary. No approval is required.

3. No stealing a contract from a fellow Mercenary. If you would like a 
contract/job, speak to the Contracting Officer.

4. No killing your fellow mercenaries.

5. Be loyal to one another and back each other up - This will be important
if the entire Guild is contracted out to fight a battle. We need to be
able to trust each other in a fight as brothers in arms.

6. Each Mercenary should be able to hold their own in a fight.

Rules 1-4 are pretty concrete as they stand even without my going through
Sarg.  I'll get with him regarding this post and see if there's anything
else that he'd like to add.  I'll also be ironing out the Guild Rates for
hires and what Mercenaries can expect in terms of payment here in the near
future.

A paper is brought to the attention of the holy order, curious eyes reading it over before passing it along, eventually making its way up the ranks. It is a letter from a known cleric, Zodan, who has been traveling alongside some of the orders crusades for some time.
 
As such, he is a common face, and many know small tidbits about him. He had been married to Amilia, also a traveling cleric who had dissapeared. He was a pacifist, going as far as to not even carry a weapon when traveling with some of the order. He was the son of Gulgor and was often seen with him on his routes many ears ago when the cleric was younger.
 
The cleric never showed interest in joining the ranks of the order, only traveling with some groups when they head out to help an area or others. This was the first form of communication he had with the order save for the trips, it had been given to a caravan and was asked to be given to Tyrail, though many had read it by now.
 
The simple joining request reads:
'{cBrothers and sisters of the Holy Order, I write to you today a new man. As life sometimes does, my life was torn asunder. Details aside, the Empress has given me a second chance and I do not wish to waste it. The Chaslor line would be proud to have one within your group, and I would be deeply humbled.{x'

The sun peaks over the landscape in the distance, kissing Nidalee and her Forester family softly till they wake. Another beautiful day it seems- the sun bright, grass is green, animals stirring as they, too, begin the day. A gentle breeze stumbles through their makeshift halls, a smile from Nidalee greeting it.
 
Not all remains so calm, however, as a screams echo's through the surrounding area. It sounds like an evlven female, most likely a simple sister in their extended family. Coming to attention, Nidalee rushes to the source in her wolven form, shifting back to speak with a woman- she is on her knee's over a corpse of a vine and blood covered male kagonesti. 
 
Investigating, Nidalee finds that the man died of internal bleeding, a strong impact breaking one of his ribs which punctured some organs. He had a frightened expression and had been left there overnight as his shape had been imprinted into the surrounding ground.
 
Having died of internal damage, it seemed strange to Nidalee that the man would be covered in blood. Wiping some up with a finger, she smells the blood for a moment. 'Its human,' the druid thinks. Closing her eyeslids for a moment, they open to reveal the slitted eyes of a predator, glowing slightly.
 
Her vision was now magically enhanced by the druid, a trail of scents being seen leading from the corpse to off into the distance. With a growl, she assumes her wolven form and follows the trail. It leads back to the Qualinesti forest, actually right to the spot previous events occured.
 
As she arrives, she finds more corpses. 'They are human for sure,' Nidalee knows, and upon looking closely she notices that they are the humans that had been caught and ran off from torturing some wildlife. An ominous cackling is head, the tone the same as the mysterious voice. '{DYou seem to have found my gift, wild fury. -Soooo- sorry that one of your -family- was caught in the crossfire. I was more than happy to transport him to you.{x' it said.
 
'{GReveal yourself!{x' she says, still in her wolven form but her words come out normally. Only a laugh replies, much to the druids frustration. '{DI think you have bigger issues right now,{x' it says, fading away. There was a moment of confusion as to their meaning before a massive stomp is heard.
 
A large black bear rampages through some tree's, knocking them aside with ease as he enters the clearing. The beasts claws were spotless, his growling fangs also not showing a hint of blood. His fur soft looking and damp, this huge grizzly doesn't look to have killed anything recently. Why would such a mad beast look so innocent? Something wasn't right.
 
After a few minutes of the bear charging Nidalee mindlessly, almost insane in nature, only to have the druid tumble out of the way. Trying to wear down the beast doesn't seem to work, however, as it does not slow down. Anavrin, the eagle, sits on a branch on a tree surrounding the clearing, simply watching.
 
Only once does Nidalee raise her spear, an attempt to frighten the grizzly. An attempt that fails. It would have charged into the spear had she not given up the taunt. No bear would have acted this way naturally, she thought. No. She knew. Cautiously, the druid exits the clearing and enters an area of thick vines where the bear entangles itself in its rage.
 
Placing a hand on the bears head, Nidalee enters the mind of the animal in an attempt to find the cause of this disturbance. It was void. The bears mind was blank, empty, black, bottomless. A single red beam of light shined brightly from what seemed to be the middle of this place within. As the druid draws near she notices a black clothed individual behind the light, a hand on either side as if controlling it.
 
Nidalee fails to see their impressed smirk when she is noticed, because of a dark aura and veil surrounding them, she saw no details. Fading into the distance once again, Nidalee gives chase only to be met with a force of barriar within the beasts mind. The mystery individual got away again.
 
Exiting the grizzlies mind, Nidalee is saddened. She looks to the entangled bear, who's eyes simply gazed into the distance with no thought. No longer driven mad and controlled, only a blank slate is left, running on pure instinct to know how to breath. Anavrin lands on the ground nearby, looking to Nidalee and gives her a form of a saddened nod.
 
The druid lowers herself to just below the bear, putting some force into a thrust and piercing it's heart. The death is instant, and painless, for the bear. A quick glance around to make sure 'it' had left, she cuts the vines binding the bear and magically sinks the corpse into the ground to be quickly decompsed. Saddened, she returns home.
 
Below, growing slowly, the sprout grows a few inches higher, two new bare stems forming on either side. It still contains only one leaf, but it now has lost some of its color and has almost completly wilted. She had done good in one respect, and horrid in another.

Hello Ladies and Gents,
   It has come to my attention that while I am busy with the purchase of my new business. A number of you have been breaking some rules and complaining publicly about immortal business to mortals. So, I am going to address this in a general forum so all of you can reply as you see fit. First, I have seen an improvement on Immortals being visable more and interacting with mortals. However, some things have come to my attention. 
 
1)Immortals are telling mortals our private business. What few mortals we have at this time have no business being brought into or told about what goes on behind closed doors up here in immy heavens. If this continues, I will bump you down to 102 and you can have a meeting with Hiddukel and myself to explain why you feel you need to tell mortals immortals business.
 
2) The gift giving has gotten out of control. I have logs of a few of you giving xp AND items to mortals for their hardwork and roleplay. They may get one OR the other. Not both AND it needs to be within reason. If this continues, I will be speaking with you privately to see why your giving such lavish gifts for an hour of roleplay.
 
3)Now on a personal note: It has come to my attention that some of you don't like me. That Paladine deleted because he was pissed off that I was an Imp. I am not here to be liked. Understand, that EVERYTHING I do I make sure my boss Hiddukel knows. I am not unapproachable as some of you may think. However, I will not tolerate lies and rumors. I left high school 15 years ago. If you have a challenge with me, come and
talk with me about it. It does not mean you will get the answer you want...however I will always listen to what you are saying. I am not here to be liked. I am here because I love this game. I have played it for soon to be 9 years, and I want to see it back in it's glory. So, if the high school rumors and gossip continue I will speak with you privately on the matter.
 
 
In conclusion, I think we have a great team. What I think we need to work on is trust and working as a team. Which this is not happening right now by a good 70 percent of you. I am open to suggestions. Let's start with a 10 percent shift today and STOP including mortals in our affairs. Thank you for your time. Please drive thru!

A paper comes across the desk of the Mercenaries' contracting officer. It is high quality paper, seemingly hand written by quill in elegant cursive.
 
It reads:

After the short paragraph there is an imprinted set of red lips, left on the page from where she pressed it against hers.

To: mercenary
Hey everyone.  I'm your new fearless leader and contracting officer.  I'm
going to lay down a few rules for being a successful mercenary.  (OOC: These
are currently placeholders and I'll have something more concrete in place
once I meet with Sarg). As of right now, all prior contracts are null and void.

1. All new contracts must be made through me. No exceptions. I will contract
the Mercenaries out as a whole guild and offer jobs (contracts) to all
members of the guild.

2 Bounties are fair game to any mercenary. No approval is required.

3. No stealing a contract from a fellow Mercenary. If you would like a 
contract/job, speak to the Contracting Officer.

4. No killing your fellow mercenaries.

5. Be loyal to one another and back each other up - This will be important
if the entire Guild is contracted out to fight a battle. We need to be
able to trust each other in a fight as brothers in arms.

6. Each Mercenary should be able to hold their own in a fight.

Rules 1-4 are pretty concrete as they stand even without my going through
Sarg.  I'll get with him regarding this post and see if there's anything
else that he'd like to add.  I'll also be ironing out the Guild Rates for
hires and what Mercenaries can expect in terms of payment here in the near
future.

Greetings brothers and sisters,
 
Regretably I write this letter to you to inform you all that someone who walks amongst the shadows breaxhed the courtyard of our clanhall.
 
They whispered the first time "Watch out she is a fiesty one." They then proceeded to knock Casumi out cold. I saw her body fall, And immediately mentally projected for help.
 
The voice whispered again "Where are they?" I had no answer. They then whispered again "OrderMasters?".
 
At that moment Lady Shimai and Master Yerthorn arrived.

A loud knock is heard on the doors entrance to the Knights of Solamnia's guild hall. It was one of the guards stationed outside, who's knock signals that a higher-up needs to come to the door. Doing so, cracking the door open, stands a large man in silver armor.
 
Eyebrows raised at this odd priest-looking man in gold robes, the two begin to talk. As it turns out, the man is a priest of the Winged one, Shinare. He had been given a vision of the recent attack on one of Her temples. As her followers aren't prone to violence, this information had been brought to the Solamnics to take care of.
 
The knights were given a detailed description of the woman who did it. It was not hard for the knights to know who the man was speaking of, looking amoung themselves with nods. The priest described Maria, a local merchant who claims to be a prophet of Shinare.

Subject Betraying the Thieves~
Text
The smell of blood is carried by a breeze out of the garnet mountains, many shepards and travelers leaving the area as a result. The smells are emitting from an unseen entrance to the Thieves Guild, where inside there has been a betrayal. "I will betray my brothers in your name," a woman says, her bright blue eyes glimmering in the dark, standing over a survivor who asked why. She leaves the man alive, someone to warn the rest.
The Guild has fallen to inactivity. The leader had abandoned them, power and respect had been lost. The current members simply leeched off the hard work of the previous- it was sickening. Eulicia, under the guise of a Shinare devotee, did her best to breath some life into the Guild - supply them with intel and the means to do His work. Nothing came of it, the blood of the Thieves had been lost and weakened to the point of being a joke. 
The only way to return fear to His name was by purification. Give the Guild a clean slate, new blood that will carry.
Casting aside her ruse of a merchant, the woman traveled to the Garnet mountains. Laying outside the entrance bloody, she gained access to the halls as the incompetant members dragged her inside- her familiar face enough of reason despite having left the Guild already. Many returned to their duties elsewhere in the halls as one stayed to care for her. 
Wiping away some blood, the man discovers no wound underneath it, a look of shock on his face for a mere moment before a dagger pierces his heart, penetrating through to the other side as his clothes form a point above his back.
Eulicia wasted no time cloaking herself, poisoning the fountain, freeing the slaves and destroying many facilities. Headed to the west wing, there was an understanding nod between her and the executioner as he saw her determined eyes. {DHe knows why, he understands, he lives to serve on.{x Moving onto the banker and dining hall within, where everyone stayed, they rejoiced as she entered unharmed. 
{DHad the thieves grown so weak in the leaders absense they didn't know what went on in their own halls?{x... {DIt will be tricky,{x Eulicia thought, {Dtaking out so many within such a small area.{x It helped that some were drunk, and others were distracted harassing some slave girls, but that wouldn't be enough. 
She stays there, enjoying a drink with some of the men and chatting, occasionally making excuses to leave and she sees someone leave on their own, only to blackjack them from the shadows and slit their throat - a painless end for those who ruined the name of the Guild. The numbers dwindling, the hall starts to stir with whispers of where everyone had gone.
{DThose not here in the halls were out doing His work,{x she thought. {DEither one of them will take this opportunity to bring greatness back to the Guild, or I will be hunted. Either way, this betrayal was what was needed.{x Standing, she announced that it was time for her to leave, and wished to be escorted out.
Taking care of the two men that accompanied her, the numbers left within the hall were insignificant and never seen again; perhaps because of Pheodora taking care of the rest, or perhaps the executioner. Either way, the useless blood within the halls were taken care of and it had the chance to start again. 
Or atleast, that's how a survivor told it at a bar before dissapearing that night.
 
OOC: Tried to make this as a story, but it wouldn't post correctly. Note works just as well, I guess.

A young looking brunette appears at the foresters clanhall one day. Looking to be out of breath as she stumbles to the ground, she calls for help. Nidalee, druid of Chislev, alongside many guardians of the halls come to see the commotion.
 
It doesn't take long to settle the girl down, she not recognized as Eulicia as her change in appearance was subtle enough to throw off one's memory. "{mBandits, or or trappers, or someone. We were attacked when we stumbled across them..{x" When asked who 'we' were, the woman claimed she traveled with her husband, enjoying a stroll together along a trail.
 
Angered by an "attack" on innocents within the forest, Nidalee and most of the guards head in the pointed direction. Knowing they would return soon, Eulicia tricked her way into the guild claiming to have injuries and not feeling safe outside. Once in, she proceeded to an alter of sorts where she loses the guards.
 
Attempting to slip a small statue into her bag, a mighty eagle perched on the door frame hawks at her and lunges.
 
The guardians return, sour-faced as they suspect being dooped, and some not even that much; they just think they're incompetant. It doesn't take long before an injured eagle, Anavrin, is found on an altar floor injured; what seems like a broken wing cripples it from flying. Branchala's Steed, a holy statue used to summon an elven horse of Branchala, had been stolen from the grounds.

Mercenaries Will bring back criminals for trial or imprisonment.  For our
service we will be paid ______________ .  More difficult criminals requiring
"special attention" will be paid more in the form of __________.  We would

will bring the criminal back to the nearest Solamnic Knight for custody or
the Solam nic Castle here in Palanthas, whichever is closer.  3.  The
Criminal may be require medical attention at time of delivery so long as the
criminal is alive.  ' 4.  The Mercenaries DO NOT Agree to the enactment of
any bounty against a Solamnic Knight.  The individual Mercenary will be held
responsible for any crime if caught.  The Guild as a whole accepts no

I, Arlanthis Breeze, would like to volunteer for the zombie one. Thats sort of my specialty.
And also we should think carefuly before signing any contracts with the Solamnics and lose out on all the potential
contracts against them. And vice versa. That way we can maximum our profit potential.
And also everyone is not fond of the solamnics nor has a healthy history with them.

Subject Letter of Request~
Text
{yDear Lords and Ladies,
My name is Sophie Rehtael, and I write this humble letter in hopes to gain a squireship under one of the knights of your order. I am a simple person, from a simple family. I was raised just south of Palanthas, near the high clerists tower. I grew up hoping that one day I could venture inside as a knight myself. I know little about m birth family, only that I was discarded and raised by simple farmers.
They treated me well enough, fed me, clothed me, and put a roof over my head. When I turned five they sent me away to live with a wealthier family, as a servant. One day when I was playing with the lords son with wooden swords his father took note and let me train with his boy. However he would rarely let me practice with a real sword saying a sword is nothing for a young lady.
He let me practice archery, and with the spear quiet often, then when I turned 18 I ventured out on my own, to make my own name, and with hopes to be a Knight of the sword one day.
May Kiri lead you all to a rightfull decision,
Sophie{x

Bretheren and Sisters,
I met with a young lady today upon request, within the solace of the Portal's quiet rooms. She proceeded to speak with me about a matter that disturbed me greatly. A very nice young lady she was, and she proclaimed that one of our esteemed Squires, by the name of Demetrius, usurped his Lord, or Ladies, power without permission and placed upon the young lady a charge.
I had a warden check with our bookings, and indeed she had been placed under investigation and charge for the action of murder. Though, corruption may taint her bones, she nicely proclaimed that no such thing happened, especially upon Solamnic grounds. She even went as fast as to tell me that this squire also failed to produce enough evidence for this trial/charging.
I am absolutely appauled by this, and it will not go unpunished. I spoke with the book keeper of our Hall, and informed him that this young lady shall no longer be apprehended, or pursued for the cause of murder until further investigation, and PROPER EVIDENCE, is produced.
{/{/I would also like to speak with this Squire, Demetrius, and his Lord or Lady that is overseeing his Squireship. This must be discussed as soon as possible, and if no missive or contact is made within one weeks time, it will be considered an act of Treason, and the pair will be deemed as deserters. I do hope to see or speak to the pair of you soon.

Subject A Girl's Death~
Text
You lay in bed at night, white sheets drapping your figure more heavily than normal. You don't feel at ease, your heart is aching to know what you should feel and why.
When you close your eyes, you see her. Her body stiff and dark, an evil grin shining at you with such malous intent that it chills you. Her eyes, though, show her sadness. Deep blue pearls, glistening against the suns light as they wetten slowly. 'Why was she sad?', you wonder..
It takes hours, but you fall asleep. Within your dreams is a dark void, much like the one you were dragged from by your son. You turn around within at the sound of a whimper.
Before you now is a metal-looking cage, the bars glowing a bright malicious red. Within, a girl is huddled over in the corner crying. She is nude, though her long brown hair drapes off her shoulders and covers everything nicely. Her hands hide her eyes as she cries.
You approach cautiously, 'Maria?' you ask within your mind as it echos through the void.
'Sera,' it speaks with a stuttering weak voice, 'in the end, it looks like I was the bad guy. All I wanted was to be good. I tried so hard, I did so much. My moments of weakness haunted me, they followed me begging me for more.'
She shifts, bringing her knees to her chest and hugging them close with her arms, 'I wanted to be your daughter, I wish I could have been. I'm sorry..' it speaks again. You find yourself unable to call out to her, the cage slowly floating away from you into the unending darkness in the distance.
"What will you do?" beckons a voice in your head, as you jolt awake in your bed. You're not sure if it was a dream or something else, but a deep sadness grips your soul.

Text
Hello everyone,{/{/I have decided to make a few changes to the clan, to help it run a bit more smoothly (rp reasons). 
{/First: Gwenniver shall now be referred to -IN CHARACTER- as Captain of the Crown. I had placed her within the Order of the Sword, stupidly. Being that i've been absent for some time due to my child being born, i forgot that the Order of the Sword is generally for cleric-knights. Seeing as how she is no cleric, i have decided to place her within the Order of the Crown. 
She has been around the clan for a good bit, and as such, i shall not just be placing her as a Knight of the Crown, but Captain. For those of you who do not know, that means -IN CHARACTER- she will be in charge of a Regiment. (That is sixty men.) I am not going to get into the details of awarding land IC, because that's just silly because none of us will actually put that to use with such a small playerbase.
{/{/Second: Pilarth, will be promoted to Warden of the Rose. He will not have to act directly with the Squires, and seeing as how we have no High Warrior, Gwenniver will be in charge of that department. Being Warden of the Rose, he will be the highest active Knight in our clan. 
That also means -IN CHARACTER- he is in charge of a Compgroup. A compgroup is basically seven regiments (also known as wings if you wish to use that in your roleplay) (This is about 420 ment, with a commander under him).
{/{/Now, this next part is important. Those of you in the clan that are SQUIRES are not allowed for any reason to use your apprehend, pardon, or charge skills for any reason. The only thing i will allow -IC- is using your charge skill to check a players past history of charges (charge [player] check). I will enforce this strictly. Consider this a first, and last warning.
{/Now, if anyone has any question or concerns addressed, or even not mentioned, then please feel free to contact me. Lets get this clan up and running like it should be guys. This used to be one of the hardest, strongest, strictest clans the MUD had. I believe in each of you, lets get this going! {/{/Good luck!{/{/-{WKiri{x-

Hello all
 
 
It has come to my attention that while I have been busy with the bakery, that some of that high school mannerisms I have said I did not want to happen HAS been happening. Let me be clear when I say this...if a mortal is bad mouthing you on a public channel, speak with them privately in your room. If you see a mortal taking bad or gossipping about an imm on a public channel, ask them to stop and speak with them privately if needed. This should not be hard to consider.
 
If Darkahn comes on again, and begins to bad mouth me, or any other immortal on this team. It is to be logged, and he is to be ask nicely to keep his point of view to himself. If he continues, place him in my room and I will deal with him when I log on and see him. I will not tolerate gossipping or bad mouthing the immortals. If you do not handle him in a more professional and IMMORTAL manner. We will have to
talk in private as well about your desire to remain on this team.
 
 
Second, a friendly reminder that I am seeing ALOT of you logging in and then logging off almost instantly. I would like to remind you that we need ACTIVE immortals, and people who will be around to show a presence on this mud. So, please log in and prepare to hang around a bit more please. If you can not do this, perhaps we will need to discuss if you wish to remain on this team so we can open up your position for those who will want to log in and be around more often.
 
 
Thank you for your time in this matter.

Hello all
     So...good news and bad news. The bad news is that my online times will be cut in half until I hire a Head Baker at the Bakery. I am the one who is currently doing 80 percent of the baking for my business right now. It makes me a busy girl with 2 kids, a husband and a business that is picking up quicker then expected.
 
The good news is I landed a major account with Kimberly Clark that has me making 300 baked goods a morning for their employees EVERY day, expect Sunday. So I am up at 2:30am and at the bakery for 3am everyday, (Yes...time to make the Donuts). So you can tell that I am a busy girl. When I hire a head baker he will handle the major stuff and I will handle the business aspect and minor baking.
 
Until then...I won't be around as much. -HOWEVER- this does not mean I wont log in. I wont check logs. I won't keep an eye on you. I will do that when I am able, so this is not a time to slack off. I expect professionalism, and being on as much if not more. I am going to start considering that if I don't see more log in times from some of you on this team. We will need to talk in 30 days about if you will remain on this team.
 
PS: I love seeing those of you who have been around and roleplaying. Thank you for your hard work and keep it up!

CONTEXT: hidd is angered that seraph is influencing eulicia too much, straying her away from his missions. in an attempt to solve this, he wipes her memories. The following takes place when they meet, after she spends some time being a trickster to the others in the room. (when he takes control of her, its because he sees that seraph still has a pull on her, despite the lack of memories.)
Seraph pulls Eulicia twords* her, pulling the girl in to her lap as she continues to run her fingers through the girls hair 'You are such a goof Maria.'
Eulicia says 'Who?'
Seraph chants ' You'
Eulicia purrs playfully as she is patted, "I like you. What's your name?"
Seraph raises her eyebrow to Eulicia 'You know who I am Love. Dont play coy.'
Eulicia blinks at the cleric and shakes her head. Turning in Sera's lap, she points to Gwen, then to Zodan, and finally Amilia naming them off one at a time, "Lady Knight Gwen, Zodan.. someone's.. son, and his wife. But not you miss, but your touch is good, keep going."
Seraph looks up to Zodan as she continues to run her fingers through Eulicias hair. A look of worry on the womans face. 'I am Seraph.. Seraph Chaslor.. Zodans mother.'
Eulicia says 'Ohhh your son? Nice, I'm sure your proud of him. I guess that's why I couldn't remember.'
Seraph looks down to Eulicia 'Child.. did you get harmed? How.. How can you not remember me?'
Eulicia continues to sway side to side and closes her eyes, relaxing in the woman's lap. "I don't.. think so.. and I would remember such soft hands," she says playfully.
Seraph pulls Eulicia closer with one hand, continuing to run her fingers through her hair. 'You..really dont recall who I am..' she states with a few tears starting to run down her cheeks 'Well.. perhaps then we can start again. As I said, I am Seraph Chaslor, Leader of the Asthetics and high priestess of Zivilyn... You are like a daughter to me.'
Eulicia sways to her left as she is pulled, resting the side of her head against Sera's shoulder, eyes still shut. With a yawn, she says softly, "You make me so sleepy, Seraph Chaslor." After a moment and a small breath, she adds, "Leader, hmm? Maybe you can.. be of use."
Seraph should be able to recall them as part of the first conversation she and Eulicia had together, so long ago.
Seraph continues to run her fingers through Eulicias hair 'Well... I would not say it is exactly useful..' She breaths looking back up to Zodan as she bites lightly on her lip. 'If you need to rest though you are more then welcome to do so right here child.'
A winged demon flies into the room and grunts at you.
The demon hisses, 'A message comes for you.'
The demon hands you a scrawled parchment and flies away with a sharp hiss.
From Isolda, the scroll reads: really.. I mean really? what are you trying to pull?
Eulicia opens her eyes, leaning up to recieve a message with a brush of her eyes. Half opened eyes scan from left to right on a piece of parchment, simply flipping it with a twist of her wrist and letting it fall to the floor. "Weird," she says simply, yawning again.
Zodan leans forward, making sure not to push his wife, just enough to read the message on the ground.
Zodan leans back, glaring at the girl from across the room. He continues to keep an eye on her now, carefully.
Seraph simply continues to run her fingers through Eulicias hair, pulling the girl closer. She seems to ignore the massive that was delivered to the girl though her eyes are focused on Zodan.
Amilia whispers to Zodan 'what did it say?'
Zodan whispers to Amilia 'They are asking what her plan is.. I would only assume a plan involving this little .. thing she's doing.'
Amilia hugs on to Zodan, focusing her attention on Eulicia and Seraph.
 
Eulicia leans back against the cleric, adjusting to put her arms around Seraph's head for what seems to be more support. "So you say that you're my mother, or something? My mother's name is Maria, an elven noble in qualinesti.." she says, in what seems to be a half asleep babbling.
Seraph shakes her head as she continues 'No no, I view you as one of my children.. I will always protect you as such. There is no relation of blood just of heart.' she says quietly moving her gaze from Zodan to Eulicia.
Eulicia smiles, her eyes opening. As Seraph's gaze falls on the girl, deep sea blue pupils returning the gaze. There is a light and warm smile exchanged between the two before, seemingly sudden and randomly, the girls arms falls limp and she falls backwards from the clerics lap and onto the stone ground.
Eulicia seems to be unconcious, limp in the cleric's arms. Her head arched back, arms hanging down from her sides, a black mark appears on the girls forhead and a small pillar of smoke billows from the edges, as if it's being burned into her skin. It is the mark of the Betrayer, Hiddukel.
As the cleric speaks, her words seem to cause a reaction in Eulicia, her eyes jolting open and she seems to become a shadow that melts off from Sera's arms. There is a crack heard in the air, Eulicia appearing across the way. "You." it claims, some living shadows raising from her shoulders as if evaporating into the air, "The Betrayer wants your blood, woman." it says coldly.
Zodan stands, stomping across the yard to stand between the two, stopping halfway to his destination with a sudden pain- a black bladded dagger lays in his gut, it seems to simply phase through his armor.

Seraphs eyes follow the shadows though it does not seem to frighten her. 'you..' she whispers, brining herself to her feet to run to Zodan. She places her hands on the wound whispering some words of healing before moving in front of him. 'Do not let your m,ark control you you..'
 
Amilia moves quickly to Zodans side before grabbing on to Seraphs arm 'Would you stop! You are going to get yourself killed and this is starting to really take an affect on all your children..'
The girl's mouth falls open, a dark voice billowing out and echo'ing into the area. It speaks in a cold and hateful tone, it chills your spin to the core, "You took what was his- there is a price to pay." There is no sign of Eulicia, or Maria as known, in the voice, nor in the eyes.
Seraph glances over to Amilia 'Take care of your husband, I will speak to you later.' she hisses before moving forward more 'What did i take of his? As for the price to pay i will refuse.'
Zodan grunts, each attempt at grasping the dagger fails- therefore removing it seems to be impossible by himself. He staggers backwards, landing on his ass back in his original sitting position, "I'm fine, get her." he seems to say to his mother, gritting his teeth.
The girl extends her right hand outwards, shaped as if holding something but there is nothing in it. "You don't have a choice," he cries, "You took one of His children, he shall take one of yours." With that, Eulicia's arm turn 90 degrees, Zodan shreeks as the dagger in his gut also turns painfully.
Amilia moves give Zodan full cover healing the wounds on his as they form. Her continuing to attempt to remove the dagger.
Seraph moves closer to Eulicia 'I see that Hiddukle is a bitch then.' she says giving a light smile. 'Cant even fight me, has to fight a child. What a wimp. I mean. honestly. ' she laughs as the smile turns to showing teeth. 'I could always have more children. Whats one.'
Zodan falls to one knee, leaning forward, some blood dripping onto the ground. He loses some color, it's apparent that the dagger's stab isn't what's deadly, it is indeed draining the man.
'Zodan.. you cant die on me..' Amilia whispers as she places her glowing white hand on his face. 'You can fight through this Zodan..'
Eulicia grins maniacally, "I have the bitches memories, little girl. You're little bluffs don't work on the Betrayer.." it states in the same bone chilling voice as normal. "But.. this one is like a child to you. Perhaps two birds with one stone is the more efficient way to take care of this," it seems to say to itself. With a tug of the arm, the shadowy dagger plunges out of Zodan- now with full view of it, you can tell it branches off halfway down the shaft into a trident shaped dagger, half of wh
Eulicia (cont) half of which fades in and out of vision in a divine manner. With a twist of the hand, the dagger snaps towards Eulicia while hovering in the air near Zodan.
A large amount of blood splashing onto the pavement, Zodan falls. It's not hard to understand that the dagger was bigger inside of him than previously thought, and it being ripped out caused a lot of damage.
 
Seraph swallows hard as she moves closer to Eulicia, wrapping her arms around the girl 'Stop..' she states looking up to the girl 'Stop this now.. ' she growls laying her head on the girls shoulder.
Amilia quickly tends to Zodans wounds.
Eulicia is now face to face with the cleric, not budging at the embrace. The dagger slowly moves through the air, stopping just before the side of Maria's head. It seems to hover there, the symbol on her head glowing. With the dagger so close, in Seraph periferal vision, it smiles wide and glares into the clerics eyes.
Someone coils a whip around your neck and yanks you to the ground!
Cackling from the ground as it lays on it's back, the voice still continues, "You are going to stop ME?" Eulicia asks, the dagger pointing down and jolting into her side just below the ribs in a tender spot.
Cackling further, the voice almost crazy in nature, "Payment as been made," the voice billows, the mark dissapearing in a smokey evaporation from Eulicia's forehead. After the smoke clears, you can see her skin growing paler.
 
Eulicia opens her eyes slightly, weakly looking to Seraph for a moment, then to Isolda. With the weakest giggle you've ever heard she speaks, "I'm sorry Sera."
Eulicia narrows her eyes at Eulicia as a perfect copy of Eulicia.  She draws forth and opens a tome beginning to flip through its pages.  "Isn't this annoying.  Can't you just die and leave my Mistress alone?"  She sighs as she halts on a page and begins to recite its magic.  The words disappear from the page as the magic is finally invoked.
Eulicia recites a scroll of salvation, heal, heal.
A Crusader of the Holy Order has been your salvation!

Eulicia: A Girl's Death
Fri Aug 23 16:29:32 2013
To: Seraph
You lay in bed at night, white sheets drapping your figure more heavily than normal. You don't feel at ease, your heart is aching to know what you should feel and why.
When you close your eyes, you see her. Her body stiff and dark, an evil grin shining at you with such malous intent that it chills you. Her eyes, though, show her sadness. Deep blue pearls, glistening against the suns light as they wetten slowly. 'Why was she sad?', you wonder..
It takes hours, but you fall asleep. Within your dreams is a dark void, much like the one you were dragged from by your son. You turn around within at the sound of a whimper.
Before you now is a metal-looking cage, the bars glowing a bright malicious red. Within, a girl is huddled over in the corner crying. She is nude, though her long brown hair drapes off her shoulders and covers everything nicely. Her hands hide her eyes as she cries.
You approach cautiously, 'Maria?' you ask within your mind as it echos through the void.
'Sera,' it speaks with a stuttering weak voice, 'in the end, it looks like I was the bad guy. All I wanted was to be good. I tried so hard, I did so much. My moments of weakness haunted me, they followed me begging me for more.'
She shifts, bringing her knees to her chest and hugging them close with her arms, 'I wanted to be your daughter, I wish I could have been. I'm sorry..' it speaks again. You find yourself unable to call out to her, the cage slowly floating away from you into the unending darkness in the distance.
"What will you do?" beckons a voice in your head, as you jolt awake in your bed. You're not sure if it was a dream or something else, but a deep sadness grips your soul.

Greetings to the great conclave of mages.
My name is Korthus Blackfire of the silvanesti.
For years and years I have been facinated by the magical arts and I have studied some of the art.
I discovered my potential for magic one day when a young child was drowning in the river.
By all accounts the  child should've died due to the fact that the part of the river where she had been caught was near the rapids.
I had no other means to save her and I was about to give up when a voice rang in my head as if next to me and I knew what to do.
Uttering the words of a levitation spell I jestured towards the child in the water, and to my surprise she rose gracefully out of the water and landed scared yet safely on the shore.
I then began to study with the magical schools in silvanesti, as my power grew, so did my hunger for more.
I write to you now in the hope that the great collective knowledge of the conclave may honor me in granting me a place among them.
I will learn fast and work hard, I will sware to uphold the art and most of all I will protect the art with my life and soul if need be.

Greetings to the revered and feared knights of takhisis.
My name is Jerrid Shadowsong of palanthas.
I write this letter to you because ever since I was a small child I have been enspired by the knights of takhisis.
I grew up in the city of palanthas with my parents and 2 siblings. Life for us wasn't easy but it wasn't hard either.
I always used to watch the knights of solamnia patrol and I used to wish to join them.
Until the day I saw a noble knight in a drunken stooper prey upon a lady and rape her.
My ideals of the solamnics went down from there. Then when the knights of takhisis came to our city, I was impressed by their order and precision.
No roudyness or otherwise unseemly behavior.
I knew then that these were men of great value and morals.
I was 14 when all this happened and I wanted to join as soon as I could but then my parents died.
I was grief stricken and I knew then that no god or goddess but Takhisis, Queen of Darkness would help me stop those who I loved from dying. I blamed my parents deaths on paladine, it was unfair, because I stopped worshipping his knights in favor of their betters.
I began training with a sword and other weapons, I became as good a warrior as I could. Now at the age of 17 I finally write this letter praying to Takhisis that I will be accepted.
I wish to become part of the order of the Lilly, I will work hard, learn fast, and work in the name of the great queen Takhisis.
I hope that the honorable knights of Takhisis take me into consideration.
Sincerely: Jerrid Shadowsong

Subject Mortals Leaders~
Text
Ok everyone....here is the short of it. You may only have ONE mortal leader. If you consider the fact that you are the leader of your clan as an Immortal. I think I am being generous when I say you can be a mortal leader of an OPPOSITE clan. This is something that will not be a permenant thing.
 
It is to help promote active rp in the clans until more mortals are back in our game. So to be clear:
 
For example: As Takhisis, I am the immortal leader of KoT. As Pheodora I am the mortal leader of Thieves Clan. This means I CAN NOT have ANY leadership position in ANY other clan until I give up my spot with Pheodora. So if you have more than your immortal leader and ONE mortal leader at this time. You have 7 days from today to give that OTHER position up to someone else or you will be in violation of a rule and we will talk privately.
 
Thank you for understanding and come and see me with any questions you have on this matter.

Hey Everyone
    I did tell you all that this might be coming and I have decided. I see way too many of you logging in and logging out. I see not enough of you roleplaying or even attempting to roleplay with your immortals and your clans. So as of 9/5/2013, you have **30 Days** to email me your plans for being here.
 
 
What does that mean exactly? 1)What do you plan to increase activity in your clan? 2)How much time can you commit to me to log in a month? 3)Tell me how you plan to be actively involved?
 
If I do not get a response in my email within the 30 day time period, you will be removed from the team. Your answers will be reviewed by myself an another party. If we find your answers lacking the desire to be here. Then you will be removed from the team. However, that does not mean in the future you can't come back! '
 
 
If you are in fact removed from the team you will be allowed to reapply AFTER a 90 day waiting period in hopes you will be allowed to commit your time and energy into being an immortal with us. (Please understand you will be required to apply like everyone else and PROOF you can commit to being an immortal with us. You will not be promised a spot back with us)
 
The deadline will be 10/5/2013 12:01am EST. My email is Takhisis2013@gmail.com
 
You can come and see me with any questions you may have, yet I will still expect an email from ALL of you who wish to stay on this team by 10/5/2013.

Hey Everyone, it's your friendly neighbour Solinari.
Just wanted to answer the note, I am here, I am everyday online for at least 8-9 hours.
As far as RP goes, by analysing the Dragonlance lore, as one of the gods that chose abandon the godly planes to be closer to the world i don't have an avatar, so I tend to let things sort out by themselves and give my mortals free will to chose.
But, i tend to lead the white robes as a jedi master would, In fact i tend to give my true mark after they pass a test that is based on the jedi trials:
- Trial of skills (Get some piece of equipment by killing someone powerful)
- Trial of Courage (Get some piece of equipment by killing someone more powerful than you.)
- Trial of the Flesh (Get and wear  Scorched skin tattoo / tattoo of the Royal Guard of the Sithel)
- Trial of the Spirit (Making a story about facing and surviving one's worst fears - must involve meditation and overcome that fear.)
- Trial of Insight (Get the senior Report from the machine of MT. Nevermind)
Of course any one can avoid this kind of quest by proving his/her worth by proving worthy during his dailly actions, and through RP.

And though you know what I am, and whom I once served, you were still there at the end to lend me a hand with the side affects of my Testing.  Master Darkahn, though a Black Robe, and you White, he seemed to show some thought of you.

Text
The sun crawls its way down, slowly setting, as the young woman walks out the south gate of Palanthas. The guards give her a nod and a smile, as she has passed by many a times in the past weeks. As she nears Yaris, she takes off her pack, asking to leave it for safekeeping with a shopkeeper, "{yCare to watch over this? I will give you what I can spare.{X" she offers, a smile as the shopkeep nods.
Continuing on, now without her pack, only spear, shield and sword on her she heads towards the High Clerists tower. Slipping in, she makes her way to the gardens. The sun, now near completely set, the girl finds her a quiet spot where she will not be bothered, and lays down her spear. Takes of her shield. And even undoes her swordbelt. She lays them all in a pile to her left, a little over an arms reach away.
Sitting down the girl looks to the sliver of light, that is the sun before it vanishes for the night. Cross legged and alone, her only companions in the garden tonight are Solinari, bright and unwavering in the heavens and her thoughts.
As the night goes on the girl thinks back, to the first time she considered becoming a knight. It was shortly after she left "home" she noticed a knight giving away his rations to feed some local children. Not speaking to the man, she could easily reconize him from his armor. This brings a smile, that if anyone were present would show one of the most pleasant memories the girl has.
She gives a small laugh, looking around, in the dim light as she tries to keep herself awake and focused.
After a few hours, she recalls one of the first times she encountered Demetrius. He seemed well enough, still a squire, he told her whom she must speak with. This memory lingers for an hour or so, as she stays awake to the wee hours of the morning.
Her thoughts go back and fourth between friends made, and those she let slip away from lack of contact. As the morning sun slowly starts to creep up from behind her, a slight grumble starts in her stomach.
This brings back, not so fond memories of her "upbringing". Her "foster father" more like her owner, once withheld food from her for a week. She only ate what the mans other children could sneak to her. Her punishment was for missing a target with her bow.
Her face turns to a scowl as she remembers his words, "{gIf you cannot hit that target, then no food shall hit your stomach. Untill you hit it, you will not eat.{X" So she trained, night and day solid for a week, blistering her fingers, to earn a meal.
Her mind then jumps to when she was beat for dehorsing the mans son. "{gYou were not supposed to knock him off you lout!{X" she remebers him yelling. The boy brushing himself off, "{GFather, it was just practice, let her be.{X" The old mans snarl, "{gI will let her be. She can be without a roof for three nights.{X"
She shakes her head remembering not the mean old man but the kind boy, who helped her through her ordeals. She smiles, remembering that even if you come from somewhere evil, you are your own fate. You can decide who you help, and how to help them. She looks up, the sun now, in front of her, setting once again, her hunger forgotten, she gathers her things and makes back for Palanthas.

{xWrapped in a purple blanket, a newly born baby cries in her mother's arms. Giving it a warm smile, Seraph looks down into the girl's purple eyes. There was never any doubt in her mind since that day, long before the child could speak, that it was Maria- her soul attaching itself to her nearly a year ago. 'What irony,' Seraph thought to herself.
 
The child's first word was 'mommy', and she was able to speak fluently rather quickely, naming herself Maria, much to Seraph's delight.
 
The child grew quickly, many features distinctly seperating her from her previous life. Her body is a blend of her former body and that of Seraph's, taking the clerics hair which was long and dark, almost black, and her milky Complection was rather light. There is also a beauty mark mole below her left eye. She is rather tall for her age, which is now around that of a ten year old human, so it's unclear if she will end up as petite as Seraph.
 
So far, the clerics new daughter has been a rather quiet child, much to Seraph's surprise. She becomes more bold by the day, and shows no interest in doing normal child activities. She has shown a level of mauturity which further makes Seraph's belief even stronger, though the child has never admitted to anything.
 
She, for the most part, follows Seraph around town and inside the library. She secretly wonders out to watch some Solamnic knights training from the shadows of a nearby building. It's possible that this has been reported to her mother at some time, but no knight has said anything to the girl directly.
 
The young girl wears a simple white dress, matching well with her milky skin and contrasting against her black hair further. She occasionally snuck away dinner knives and other sharp weapons which she hid on her person. Upon multiple discoveries of this, she was given a small rapier and trainer to teach her. 'Knives and the like are for the weak,' was her only given reason.
 
OOC: For the sake of actually being able to play her, I aged her rapidly. TLDR: Young, black hair, pale skin, rapier on her side, mainly wears a white dress, purple eyes.

Hello, my fellow men and women of Ansalon.  My name is Galdar Chaslor, many of you may know the surname of my family, but as of now that has no matter of business.
Some of you may know of my mother, some of you may know of my Knight Father.. but that has no meaning of business as of now.
I had left home at a young age, due to the way my father had wanted to raise me.  I left home, and traveled to the Plains of the Barbarians, and there did I live for a few years, and have trained in their ways of combat.
I had returned home from the Plains and my travels, to see how my family and how things have been in Palanthas.  And as I have suspected, it is still the same, my mother and father still seem to be controlling of their children, and I can no longer tolerate it as they wish I would.
I saw your notes posted around in taverns, and I must say, I am intrigued with your brotherhood.
I would to join your brotherhood, I would love to leave this City behind, though I do wish to return at times, but I wish to continue travels, I wish to see exciting things, find untold riches, tell of great battlesof glory and fortune!

In mutual friendship, and alliance, we shall prosper and regain a strength to be truly respected.

Greetings,
 
I have met with both the Knighthood and the new Towermistress of the Conclave. The new Towermistress, for those that are unaware, is Shimai, a mage of less bloodthirst and more intellect. She has promised aid, should it be required, of at least the White Robes. Though, with the proper motivations, I'm certain that the Red and Black could be brought into the fold as well.
 
That being said, contact should probably be made with the Aesthetics and the Foresters, if possible, to ascertain their motivations in assisting the Light. Also, new events. Pilarth has stepped down as Grandmaster, and become a Templar. For those within the Holy Order, the new Grandmistress is Lady Kalaela Yancy. Also, Lady Gwenniver has been promoted to High Warrior. We will work hand in hand with the two of them, and provide what we can.
 
The Towermistress also asks that, as far as Renegades go, we do not attempt to aid them with one mage known as Jasper. She seeks that one to be left alone. He is, evidently, a member of the Aesthetics. Though, do keep in mind, the Undead are still up to their typical shenanigans. As far as my Templars and the rest of the Holy Order goes: Do not slay evil on sight. Either banish them from our lands, or subdue them and then banish them, if required.
(OOC: This means turn your damn mercy on)
 
I do not speak for the Knights, as far as how you all want to approach that topic. However, the Templars and Holy Order will aid the Knighthood in any way we possibly can.
 
That, I believe, sums up yesterday's events. For any questions, direct missives to me.
 
High Templar Tyrail Alaraeon, White Lion of the Holy Order

In an avatar of his, Hiddukel says coyly, "just sign on the dotted line, your worries will be over" to a middle aged merchant who was having troubles making ends meet. A rip is heard as if tearing fabric and Hiddukel blinks to find himself at a small courtyard with a fountain, the sky an ominous black and red hues. He turns around to see Takhisis, queen of darkness, behind him.
 
"The Solamnians are trying to be a thorn in my side," she says abruptly, "not only have their ranks grown, but they seem to be making nice with other factions of trash." Takhisis growls, taking a step forward as Hiddukel hears her out, "I want you to do something about this" she says.
 
With a gulp, Hiddukel speaks, grinning coyly, "what's in it for me?" he asks. The Queen steps forward again, placing a finger onto his chest, "oh, honey," she says, "mommy brought you from the Beyond, she can put you back" she finishes as she applies some pressure on the finger, it sinking into his skin like butter as it makes the skin around it grow black and spread.
 
"Don't patrionize me, I told you what I wanted, now what can you do for me?" she asks coldly.
 
"While, obviously, I can't meddle in the mortals affairs.." he begins, writhing as Takhisis pushes harder, "I could help bolster your line.. give you some muscle to combat theirs."
 
The Queen glares at the man, "I'm not interested in having one of your spies in my ranks." Removing her finger from his chest, she sighs.
 
Hiddukel simply raises his hands and shakes them side to side, "No no, my dear, -she- isn't a spy." With a snap of his fingers, a small statue appears in his hand, a shrunken body of Eulicia, wrapped around a pillar, chained, and seemingly frozen in time. 
 
"She was a great assit to my Guild in her time.. you could have her.. she's nimble, one with the shadows, and soulless.. a blank slate for you to pour your Hatred into."
 
"Soulless?" the Queen inquires, "the sloppy remains of some half-cocked deal of yours?"
 
"No no.. as I said, she is quiet valuable. Valuable enough that those bastards Zivilyn and Chislev fought me off for her soul. To be certain, her potential is great, and in your hands she could achieve it.."
 
"Hmm.." the Queen lets out, "a shadowy type eh? A former member of the thieves guild.. a nice addition to my Red Wing, I suppose." She thinks outloud for a moment, before snatching up the statue from his hands, "Go. Leave me. I want to play with my new toy."
 
With a simple bow, he does so, breathing a sigh of relief, "phew.. I didn't think I'd get off so cheaply this time." he thinks to himself.
 
Not too much later, Eulicia walks about freely now adorning a set of red leather armor, the wrists marked by a symbol of Takhisis. "Go, hone your skills, take care of your business, the time in which you're needed comes soon," was the Queens last words to the girl.
 
It doesn't take long for Eulicia to find Seraph, now an object of her hatred. From the shadows of the palanthas fountain, where she mocked the temple before her for their inability to keep her away, she found the cleric with a little girl in her lap.
 
There seemed to be some sort of resonance with the girl. The connection becomes obvious. Anger fills the woman, "how dare she" Eulicia thought, "to save -that-, but to have forgotten about me. Dark Queen, grant me strength."
 
It is not much later that she is spotted fleeing the scene of the Randar estate by Seraph. 
 
When Seraph finds the time to sit down and catch up on events, these events appear a few pages back, where they previously hadn't been and she knows it. Their appearance perhaps a warning.

Text
Greetings to those across Ansalon!
 
I, High Templar, have opened up recruiting to the Holy Order for a limited time. Are you seeking to get closer to the Gods of the Light? Are you seeking to be converted from your path of evil to a path of righteousness? Do you feel empty, without a place to belong? Look no further! The Holy Order of the Stars will welcome many into the fold!
 
Be without fear, for I will not convert you at sword point. Yet. We have slots we need to fill, and we may or may not have cookies. Alas, the Holy Order isn't open to everyone. Those who seek to gain profit from death, and those who study corpses are unwelcome. But almost anyone else... is free to join! A short interview and study into your character habits is all that is required. Though, any whom infiltrate the Order will be purged through fire, as fire cleanses the soul. You have been warned.
 
Contact High Templar Tyrail Alaraeon, the White Lion, today. He's hard to miss. Hulking brute of a half-elven warrior in white robes, scale mail, and a lion's pelt for a cloak. Contact can be made via missive or visit to Palanthas or Solanthus, usually the Temple of Paladine in the former, or the Holy Order clanhall in the latter. A better life, and one spent in the warmth of the Gods' embrace is worth it!

Text
"You are to be kept here, at home, unless accompanied by a guardian," says Seraph to her youngest daughter, Maria. Having lived years beyond her physical age, the girl was both insulted and hurt that someone she loved so deeply would think so little of her. Scourning her mother and the arrival of her 'guardian', Maria drinks a potion of teleport that she carried for protection.
 
She appears in the some dark woods, the area daunting to her small stature. Creatures crawl around in the shadows, minotaurs hunt about, and even some of the trees try to reach out for her. A desire to be back at home rushes into her heart immediately as she wonders about, hiding nearly futile in this setting and she knew it, going out of her way to avoid anything that might be aggressive.
Her heart starts to pound, her asthma kicking in. Fear grips the girl, the beating of her heart not helping her nerves. It thumps so loudly that she can hear it inside her head, pounding, pounding, pounding. She can hardly breath, asthma unable to be sated.
She crawls to the base of a massive oak, the gloomy area seeming to taunt her. She sinks slightly into the marsh-like ground under her as she sits under the tree, hugging her knees into her chest as she closes her eyes and tries to shake her asthma attack.
The thumps of her heartbeat shift slightly, they seem to be coming from another source.. a direction.. an out of body experiance from a dying girl? No.. no this was different. She followed the sound, it led her out of the darken forest, though it kept going. Trusting the sounds, she hardly noticed that her asthma had stopped- not only that but she couldn't feel it in her body any longer.
The sounds continued to the south as the girl followed them, leading to the streets below qualinesti. It stops before an altar of Branchala. Having read all the books present in the rendar estate, the girl quickly drew connections between the sounds, the beating, almost music in context, to this place. She knew who the god was, what he stood for, and the average followers he attracts.
It just didn't make much sense to the girl, why would he beckon her? Sure, she trained with the rapier, his favoured weapon, but so what? Nothing else lined up correctly. "Ah, a new face!" a voice shouts as a plump man, looking to be a bard, waddled over to her. "I see you have a little harp, have you come to learn.. or perhaps to pray to Astra?" he asks, looking the small girl over.
"Astra?" Maria thinks to herself, "oh, his Qualinesti nickname. I see." Still slightly confused and lost, she stutters out a few words, "I.. I don't know." she says to the man. He smiles wide, "do you feel like you don't belong here?" he asks. Maria hesitates, but then nods. What was the point of lying? She didn't know him.

The bard simply chuckles, "understandable," he says warmly. "Not many do know why they end up here, rather it be a speed bump as they coast along in the burning passion of youth or.. maybe they simply followed their heart. In any case, everyone has a story and they are welcomed here." Maria finds the mans blabbering to be on the eccentric side, but follows him into the temple regardless, seeking entertainment.
Many humorous stories are shared amoung a group formed into a circle within, smiles and laughtor echoing through the halls gleefully. "I saw your little instrument there, Maria," the same man says, "why don't you play us a song?" This catches her by surprise, the acts stunned for a second, "Oh, no, no.. this was a gift I just recieved this morning, I haven't even laid a finger on it. I don't know how.."
"Oh, just try. If anything, we can all have a little chuckle now, and one later when you're more learned of the art." It hadn't occured to the girl to -play-, or -learn- anything, but simply to have the instrument as a toy. "I.. I guess." she says, thinking there was no harm in attempting to have some fun. She picks up the small harp, holding it as a book that she once read described, and gliding her fingers along the strings.
The motion creates a simply but beautiful tone as the group falls silent. "Well, go on," the older bard says, "show us your soul." Maria fiddles with the instrument for a moment, not used to its size or shape, before ultimately holding it in her own way, resting the tip on her neck as she holds it outward, like a violin. No one mocks her for this; no devotee of Astra would.
Her fingers begin to move, skipping strings to glide, pluck, and pull various ones that, in her head, seemed like the next logical sound to make. Loving the resulting tune, she closes her eyes and continues, gradually picking up the pace. There were errors here and there, naturally, but the song played perfectly in her head. She reaches the climax of the song and she swipes her finger down the middle chord and off the end in a twirl of her hand, a blue wave of light tearing out and exploding upon impact w
ith the wooden floor.
The blast somewhat shocks everyone, shortly after followed up by applause, much to the worried girl's surprise. "HAHAHHAA, a fine bard you'll make!" bellowed the plump man, "I knew just by looking at you, you would have it." The girl sits still, slightly shocked, searching her thoughts for what had happened- 'Song of Rage' she came up with, an attack that bards us to defend themselves. 'Song Weaving', a bards ability to create effects with certain chords or notes. Fascinating.
The young girl stays a bit longer, enjoying her time with the group, and shakes the plump bards hand before she leaves. Halfway home, she growls at her hand, a tatto-looking golden harp in the center of her palm, strings stretching from it and cascade down her fingers to the tips.
The group at the shrine tells the story to all that pass by and talk for any amount of time; a story about a little girl and the beautiful soul she will one day share.

"Hmm.." the Queen lets out, "a shadowy type eh? A former member of the thieves guild.. a nice addition to my Red Wing, I suppose." She thinks outloud for a moment, before snatching up the statue from his hands, "Go. Leave me. I want to play with my new toy."
 
With a simple bow, he does so, breathing a sigh of relief, "phew.. I didn't think I'd get off so cheaply this time." he thinks to himself.
 
Not too much later, Eulicia walks about freely now adorning a set of red leather armor, the wrists marked by a symbol of Takhisis. "Go, hone your skills, take care of your business, the time in which you're needed comes soon," was the Queens last words to the girl.
 
It doesn't take long for Eulicia to find Seraph, now an object of her hatred. From the shadows of the palanthas fountain, where she mocked the temple before her for their inability to keep her away, she found the cleric with a little girl in her lap.
 
There seemed to be some sort of resonance with the girl. The connection becomes obvious. Anger fills the woman, "how dare she" Eulicia thought, "to save -that-, but to have forgotten about me. Dark Queen, grant me strength."
 
It is not much later that she is spotted fleeing the scene of the Randar estate by Seraph. 
 
When Seraph finds the time to sit down and catch up on events, these events appear a few pages back, where they previously hadn't been and she knows it. Their appearance perhaps a warning.

Maria: A Bard's Tale pt1
Sat Sep 21 18:34:08 2013
To: foresters branchala
"You are to be kept here, at home, unless accompanied by a guardian," says Seraph to her youngest daughter, Maria. Having lived years beyond her physical age, the girl was both insulted and hurt that someone she loved so deeply would think so little of her. Scourning her mother and the arrival of her 'guardian', Maria drinks a potion of teleport that she carried for protection.
 
She appears in the some dark woods, the area daunting to her small stature. Creatures crawl around in the shadows, minotaurs hunt about, and even some of the trees try to reach out for her. A desire to be back at home rushes into her heart immediately as she wonders about, hiding nearly futile in this setting and she knew it, going out of her way to avoid anything that might be aggressive.
Her heart starts to pound, her asthma kicking in. Fear grips the girl, the beating of her heart not helping her nerves. It thumps so loudly that she can hear it inside her head, pounding, pounding, pounding. She can hardly breath, asthma unable to be sated.
She crawls to the base of a massive oak, the gloomy area seeming to taunt her. She sinks slightly into the marsh-like ground under her as she sits under the tree, hugging her knees into her chest as she closes her eyes and tries to shake her asthma attack.
The thumps of her heartbeat shift slightly, they seem to be coming from another source.. a direction.. an out of body experiance from a dying girl? No.. no this was different. She followed the sound, it led her out of the darken forest, though it kept going. Trusting the sounds, she hardly noticed that her asthma had stopped- not only that but she couldn't feel it in her body any longer.
The sounds continued to the south as the girl followed them, leading to the streets below qualinesti. It stops before an altar of Branchala. Having read all the books present in the rendar estate, the girl quickly drew connections between the sounds, the beating, almost music in context, to this place. She knew who the god was, what he stood for, and the average followers he attracts.
It just didn't make much sense to the girl, why would he beckon her? Sure, she trained with the rapier, his favoured weapon, but so what? Nothing else lined up correctly. "Ah, a new face!" a voice shouts as a plump man, looking to be a bard, waddled over to her. "I see you have a little harp, have you come to learn.. or perhaps to pray to Astra?" he asks, looking the small girl over.
"Astra?" Maria thinks to herself, "oh, his Qualinesti nickname. I see." Still slightly confused and lost, she stutters out a few words, "I.. I don't know." she says to the man. He smiles wide, "do you feel like you don't belong here?" he asks. Maria hesitates, but then nods. What was the point of lying? She didn't know him.

Maria: A Bard's Tale pt2
Sat Sep 21 18:35:24 2013
To: foresters branchala
The bard simply chuckles, "understandable," he says warmly. "Not many do know why they end up here, rather it be a speed bump as they coast along in the burning passion of youth or.. maybe they simply followed their heart. In any case, everyone has a story and they are welcomed here." Maria finds the mans blabbering to be on the eccentric side, but follows him into the temple regardless, seeking entertainment.
Many humorous stories are shared amoung a group formed into a circle within, smiles and laughtor echoing through the halls gleefully. "I saw your little instrument there, Maria," the same man says, "why don't you play us a song?" This catches her by surprise, the acts stunned for a second, "Oh, no, no.. this was a gift I just recieved this morning, I haven't even laid a finger on it. I don't know how.."
"Oh, just try. If anything, we can all have a little chuckle now, and one later when you're more learned of the art." It hadn't occured to the girl to -play-, or -learn- anything, but simply to have the instrument as a toy. "I.. I guess." she says, thinking there was no harm in attempting to have some fun. She picks up the small harp, holding it as a book that she once read described, and gliding her fingers along the strings.
The motion creates a simply but beautiful tone as the group falls silent. "Well, go on," the older bard says, "show us your soul." Maria fiddles with the instrument for a moment, not used to its size or shape, before ultimately holding it in her own way, resting the tip on her neck as she holds it outward, like a violin. No one mocks her for this; no devotee of Astra would.
Her fingers begin to move, skipping strings to glide, pluck, and pull various ones that, in her head, seemed like the next logical sound to make. Loving the resulting tune, she closes her eyes and continues, gradually picking up the pace. There were errors here and there, naturally, but the song played perfectly in her head. She reaches the climax of the song and she swipes her finger down the middle chord and off the end in a twirl of her hand, a blue wave of light tearing out and exploding upon impact w
ith the wooden floor.
The blast somewhat shocks everyone, shortly after followed up by applause, much to the worried girl's surprise. "HAHAHHAA, a fine bard you'll make!" bellowed the plump man, "I knew just by looking at you, you would have it." The girl sits still, slightly shocked, searching her thoughts for what had happened- 'Song of Rage' she came up with, an attack that bards us to defend themselves. 'Song Weaving', a bards ability to create effects with certain chords or notes. Fascinating.
The young girl stays a bit longer, enjoying her time with the group, and shakes the plump bards hand before she leaves. Halfway home, she growls at her hand, a tatto-looking golden harp in the center of her palm, strings stretching from it and cascade down her fingers to the tips.
The group at the shrine tells the story to all that pass by and talk for any amount of time; a story about a little girl and the beautiful soul she will one day share.

I came on today to see you. I logged in as Xatanna to see if you were visable first. She was on for 3 seconds (literally) and Mikhal evicted her. No reason or rythmn. He did not speak with her or talk with her. He just evicted her under Chemosh's orders. He says it was because she had no desc.
 
And he said that because he did not admit her. I did when I still had 110. Chemosh and Mikhal were never on. I waited a month to roleplay with them. This is what I am talking about Craig. They are going to push me out and that is what they are doing. I summoned to speak to Mikhal.
 
And Chemosh spoke down to me in the way he spoke like I had no say.
 
I think we need to talk and define what I will be doing for you. I see Paladine is back up above 106. When I laston Paladine it told me I couldn't do that with someone higher then me. Have I lost your trust where you would put him back but not me? I was the one who got him back and put him 110 originally. I am not gonna lie. I am really conflicted.
 
Conflicted on if I will stay with all this still. Maybe we can set up a time to talk soon?

Subject KoT Facts~
Text
For all those unfamiliar with the KOT ranks, see the help file: HELP KOT RANKS.
 
I want to point out that there are, IC, more ranks than just those listed in the helpfile. For instance, the sub-groups called the onyx order (hunters of enemies), and the abjudicator of the code (the 'judge' for internal trials), order of lords, blood oath archer, etc..
 
There are also groups specifically formed for in times of war. Namely, the Dragon Highlords. There are only five dragon highlords at a time, and a duel to the death does not constiture yourself becoming one. They must be appointed to the branch that best fits them (based on which chromatic dragon they represent) by the dark queen or lord of night.
The five dragon highlords represent the black, blue, green, red, and white chromatic dragons. Each have their own personal morals and values. If you join one that you don't fit in, you are sent to trial for trechery (a step below betrayal). The dragon highlords answer only to the lord of night and takhisis, they are on equal command as a lord of lily/skull/thorn.
If you go for one of these positions, know that you must do some research first. Know your lore and which dragon you represent before attempting it.
 
I plan on talking with Takhisis to gather a complete list of the current officers within the knighthood, so that we know which ones are available. I've done a fair bit of research as well as gather all the books on the KoT, so if you have questions and are too lazy to look for the answers, let me know.
 
------------------------------------------
 
There are 3 aspects to the knighthood that should be known by all dark knights: the vision, the code, and the blood oath.
 
--->In this current time line, the Vision has been proven by the Legion of Steel to be lies. The true vision has been lost to majority of the knights, and any 'vision' brought by Skull knights should be taken with an ounce of doubt. Do not doubt the High Cleric, however.
--->The Blood Oath is simply "Submit or Die" and is used by most dark knights in prayer. It is a dark version of the solamnic, "my honor is my life" oath and often used to mock them. It also means that it applies to yourself, you shouldn't state it unless you've given your being to the dark queen. You are allowed your own personal goals and thoughts, but the Will of the Knighthood comes first if need be.
--->Much like the Blood Oath, the Code is a dark version of the Solamnic Code. Though different, it is similar to the Solamnic Code in many ways. Dark knights are to have respect both for allies and for enemies if they have earned it. 
If they have not earned your respect, they are beneath you. Virtue is unneeded, but loyalty is required. You are free to steal and murder but only if it coincides with the Vision (the original vision - conquering krynn in the name of the queen). The dark knights are NOT to rape, pillage, or plunder.
 
------------------------------------------
 
MORE KOT FACTS:
Master of the skull = Abjudicator of the code. Able to exempt a dark knight from aspects of the code if need be. Used for trials and can order an execution or pardon. His word is law and the Will of Takhisis when it comes to the Code. The Abjudicator spot was created to avoid the senseless debates that fools, such as the solamnic knights, use for their trials.
You are to recite the blood oath five times in the field in front of your commanding officer every morning. Some officers do not require this, but it was mandated by Lord Baltasar Rennold to keep a sense of honor in the ranks. 
 
Torture or execution is frowned upon, but not banned.
 
The Legion of Steel is to be considered traitors and shown no respect. Most other enemies (unless specifics such as kenders, gnomes, or human mercs) are to be soluted. This includes the solamnic knights and elves.
 
All dark knights set aside one day a year to honor Zeboim and the founding of the knighthood.
 
Draconians are pawns. They are not to raise up the ranks of the knighthood, no matter their deeds. Exemptions are made by the queen herself and ONLY the queen. No mortal has the right to deem a draconian with a rank. Elves are frowned upon, but not banned. Gnomes and kender are considered beneath you and trash.\

I have been attacked today when I was levelling up and after I specefically stated that I was doing so I was still attacked.
I have the log with me and, judging from the latest note from Zivilyn, I hope the one that did the PK be punished.
The one that attacked me was Sarthis and was saying something about me being in the undead turf and whatnot. After I told him that I was levelling he still proceeded to attack me and kill me.
I am levelling at the undead territory simply because I have nowhere else to do so, and I spoke to the person as to show that I was not triggering there. Which resulted in the loss of some time.
 
Once again, in light of the note Zivilyn sent about this kind of situation, I expect him to be punished.

Someone had come in while I was training up the skills.  I told them that you had given your permission for me to be there.
They wanted proof.  They also stole a bit of money.  I don't know who they were as they were well hidden.  But the 'our halls' should give it away.
 
See that it gets fixed.
 
Always,
 
S.K.

"Using their talents to help those in need," is a personality quirk?  I'm
sorry to inform you that personality takes to a knee when it comes to the
cosmic axis of good and evil.  A good act is a good act regardless of
whether or not a character accepts it as such.  To be true mark'ed, you must
brazenly use your talents (not be a Aesthetic wallflower) for good (not
neutrality).  It doesn't matter if you use your talents to help Takhisis
because you deem she is in need.  A good act is not a neutral act and you
can argue this until your fingers fall off.  YOU can be neutral good and
still do all this.  Favor from your God, whom is CHAOTIC GOOD, is not
welcome in the Aesthetic clan.  Also, the condescending approach in how you
chose to write your argument has been noted.  Keep this in mind next time
you try to change someone's mind on a decision made.

The attitude was for gilean, don't get me wrong. It's something for all his demanding and aggressive stances he's been making lately.
As for your reply, I believe that 'good' acts abound in the aesthetics if that's the logic for them.

Whats worse than having the perfect game to reach out to about a good time, 
opportunity to meet others, a character switch, or an [Albiet dumb] impending 
move to reach out to other games, and not being able to do so because youve 
lost touch?  How many people have you come across in your life who suddenly 
might help your cause, personally or professionally, but whom you havent 
seen or spoken to in ages  and perhaps you just feel guilty about popping 
up now that you miss them?
 
The bad news is that it happens more often than you might think. 
The good news is that its entirely possible to reconnect with people, 
even if it seems preposterous after months or years gone by. 
 
The passage of time is not a good enough reason to let a potential 
connection go to waste. If you have some youve been meaning to reach 
out to or someone youre dying to reconnect with?
To make that potentially awkward exchange much less painful and potentially 
even fruitful.. I just wanted to let you all know, Hello, Yes, I did play 
Marthias Skelsule in the past, same person, and I hope youre all well! 
Im so sorry I havent been in touch, LoK youve been on my mind for months 
and Ive just been completely consumed by a crazy schedule.

So I'll finish my tail between the legs message by letting you know that 
Id certainly love to return some RP in exchange for all the hours we log.

Ah, the ol "Take it up with non existant hiddukel" line. After my experience wiht you the other day I actually assumed I
would get more than the same robot response the other IMM's give. I was hopeing the krynn immortal land had replaced its
automated answering service and I might actualy be able to press 0 for a real person.
I am dissapointed.
Darkhan is a thorn in the side of this game and "im not gonna deal with it" is just not acceptable.
When the police refuse to protect you, what other conclusion can a man come to than Vigilantism?
I felt a spark of hope i hadnt felt in...ever...at the quickness with which you were able to resolve some time old
issues of mine.I had assumed you were the master of this realm.I can already see the nightly wholist of
18-25 players ive seen since my active return has now dwindled to a steady 5. And when did that happen?
Ah yes the night Darkhan went tantrum mode on everyone.
Its not hard to connect the lines. I suggest you man/woman up and take action or watch
as any progress youve made is lost and the last hope this mud had of reconnection dies cause of one
little twit the opossing teams of imms cant come to a resolution on how to deal with.
My apologies at your loss, and a sincere hope for your renewed confidence.

Born in a cold month, a young boy cries in the echoed halls of the Temple 
of Mishakal. Marthias Skelsule, a child born into the priesthood with a father
a High Priest and his mother as equally as beautiful in the eyes of {BMercy{x.
Soon the boy grew and as his mother encouraged what was considered a strange 
power, magic. Specifically the ability to contort objects and bend creatures to
his will. While, his Father was quick to look down upon such ways, for this boy
was born to follow in his father's footsteps and to become a cleric, but this
was not the case.
As the boy was older, his mother sent him away under the watch of a white robed
As the boy was older, his mother sent him away under the watch of a white robed
for hatred grew. A black robe was born and the name Skelsule was making a dark
stain. 
 
During a run in with a woman so powerful, Marthias was struck once again by
the vidication of Mishakal. The beautiful one to be his, Aruka, stolen from
him by the darkest of Gods, Morgion. In a power struggle to reclaim his beauty
back, Marthias turned to Disease religion in hopes to release his love that
he would never see again. 
 
Crushed the man wandered around as Morgion's puppet until he rotted to nothing.
A boney creature, pot bellied, bloated, and the stench of infection kept him
from knowing much else. Morgion once again tricked him of promise to return 
his love in service. Reluctantly, but surely he agreed. Powerful and strong
cloaked by the false guise from the god of his once handsome figure, 
Marthias grew into a powerful adversary. Turned on the conclave of wizards,
he destroyed all in his wake with the power of disease and pestilence, famine
and thirst. 
 
The creator of the contorted then began to learn necromantic spells, from 
dealings he had with the Undead. With such power the mage took over as
Nightmaster for the Black Order. Many years he reigned and soon the rot 
disolved him to no more so he turned to Chemosh to put him at rest.
 
As a cruel joke, Chemosh raised the man after a century... but he was still
property of Morgion, and so staring at his tombstone, the R was too worn from
his original name and the shattered memories began to come back in insanity.
 
Marthias still follows and belongs in his heart to H'rar, but his mind is
completely torn.

Now, there are some reading this thinking they have given most of what they have, others have given all. Those who have actually contributed to the betterment of our orders, you know who you are, but are still welcome to join me.

Hey, i just wanted to say i know there are at least 3 new 100's within the past like 3 days. and they all have sithil bracers, if im not mistaken those have an incredibly small respawn time, and a chance to not even spawn on the MOB, i didnt know who to bring this too, but i figured youd be one of the people to tell.
now, i dont really care if they did cheat, its just the concept, if they do it on one thing whos to say they wont/havent cheated elsewhere.
just shoot me a line if you need any more info on the matter, im not saying they did cheat, its just not easy to get a full set of level 100 gear, especially for 3+ people in a week, well, not since I can remember. Anyway, just a concern from a simple player.

I am seriously tired of constantly being harassed by said player and IMM.  No RP at all.  And I don't like RPing with him because he acts like a jerk and is inconsiderate and doesn't show courtesy.  I refuse to RP with any character of his and I want him to remain away from my characters.
It's to the point where I'm about ready to quit the game because of ONE player.  I can't even gather 100 gear for the assassin because of SAID player and IMM, who does nothing but CHEAT.  I'm tired of it.

I had a few characters.. don't know if it's possible to restore... it was a smith Elzix, a Conjurer raylin, ilusionist Fenix, Druid Xendralix, barbarian thorac, warrior Protous and a thief beren but i think i should replace his name... perhaps to Elidan and last name should be ok I guess...
Thank you and see you soon.

Text
Wish we had forums still, so I could write this there, but: Gerit is the
sole survivor of a shipwreck, the vessel destroyed by the Maelstrom.  Raised
by humans in a backwater fishing village, Gerit has always sought why the
storm spared him alone.  His dreams are haunted by a large turtle with the
head of a woman.  Not fit for the duties offered by the Shrine of Habbakuk
in his home town, Gerit seeks answers in Palanthas.  While in Palanthas,
Gerit learns of the other Gods and discovers Zeboim, the figure of his
dreams.  Seeking to appease the Storm, Gerit goes to the docks of Palanthas
and makes an offering of steel.  Not receiving an answer, Gerit offers his
last breath to Zeboim as he moves beneath the waves.  His calls unanswered,
Gerit loses his life to the sea.  Rising from his corpse, the spirit of
Gerit now seeks to rejoin the world he lost.  
 
This is thus far.
Will make it more detailed when forums return.
 
Gerit would offer his existence to one who would
return him his life and purpose.

Greetings to her excellency Allyria Silvershade, voice of queen Takhisis, her dark majesty.
I am Jerrid Shadowsong and I wish to become a knight in her dark majesty's knighthood.
We have met and you know this. The mission you entrusted me with is going well.
But I digress. You also asked for my history and I write this so you may know what kind of a man I am.
I once was known as Jerrid Silverstein, a commun enough name to be sure.
I was the son of a communer in the city of Palanthas.
I lived with my father who worked in a shoe shop and my mother stayed home to take care of me and my 3 brothers and 2 sisters.
We were not ritch by any stretch but neither were we beggars.
We lived on the outskirts of the city and had a small house.
We ate well most nights and went to school.
From the first time that I saw the solamnic knights, I knew I wanted to join them.
I studied hard mostly on my own to learn the code and the measure or what I could find on it.
I became skilled in hand to hand combat and began picking up sword skil from an old man who lived two houses down from me.
I also became a devoted of Paladine and made small offerings to him as often as I could.
I had just turned 15 when the greatest act of evil and my greatest disappointment hit.
I had been walking home from my sword lessons when I saw a young woman walking passed the tavern down the street.
As she walked by, the tavern's door banged open and a knight of the rose stumbled out with two companions.
I had never seen a knight in his cups and I was astonished. These men who I admired, drunk? Surely not! But that was nothing compared to what followed.
As the young lady speeded up her pace, the knight in the middle called out to her in a drunken slur of a voice. "Ho there.. my beuuty. Vanzy spendin deh ny wid your old beloved?"
She did not turn or answer the man and he grew angry and stumbled towards her. It seemed that the two had once been engaged in a relationship and she had left him.
As the knight drew closer to her, the woman broke into a run but it was to late. With a lunge, he caught her around the waist and brought her screaming to the ground.
With one tightly clamped over her mouth, the knight began to rip her clothing with his other learing at her. "You wil naw leev me like dis my dear?"
I was disghusted with this behavior. These men of honor and justice, drunk and... and raping a defenseless woman?
I had to stop him, I pulled out my knife and ran towards the pair.

To Allyria Silver shade, Lady of Night,
  Greetings your excellency. I thank you for your gracious meeting with me in Palanthas.
You entrusted me with a mission and I am proud to inform you that it is almost complete.
You also asked me to write you a letter with my personal history within it.
This is the main purpose of this letter. So without further ado, I will begin.
  I was born in Palanthas as Jerrid Silverstein. I was born to the family of a shoe maker.
We were not ritch, but we were not poor neither. We had food enough for most nights and we had desent enough clothing.
I grew up in a small house on the outskirts of the inner city with my parents and 4 siblings, two brothers and two sisters. We went to school like most children in our neighborhood and had some friends.
Ever since I had turned three, and I had seen the knights of solamnia passing by our street, I had wanted to join them.
I studied and studied all I could about the knighthood and the code. I became quite proficient in hand to hand combat by the time I was twelve years of age. Life was good for a boy of my age. I had everything I wanted for the moment, and my father told me that he would contact some of his friends within the knighthood once I reached my eighteenth year.
The day I turned fourteen, my father took me to see the old man who lived down the street and asked him to begin teaching me the ways of the sword.
The old man, after some grumbling, finally gave in. I began to train with a blade and for the next two three years, I got better and better.
The time when I would join the knighthood was not far off.
I was sixteen when the greatest disappointment of my life struck.

Subject my history partII~
Text
I was walking back home after a particularly dificult swordplay lesson.
Not six months back I had started practicing with a true steel blade and I was still gettinig acustomed to the difference in weight.
I had been reliving the afternoon's workout when I saw a young woman walking passed the tavern at the end of the street.
As she passed the front door of the establishment, the door banged open and a tall man stumbled out accompanied by two comrades. My eyes grew wide as I saw the symbols engraven on their scabbards. Knights of solamnia, and by the way they carried themselves, I guessed them to be knights of the rose, the highest order of the knighthood.
They were clearly under the influence of alcohol and routier than I believed a man to be. The woman, on seeing the three men, picked up her pace and kept her eyes forward. The knight in the middle looked up at the sound of her footsteps and laughed crudely as he began to stumble towards her. "Hah har! Loo a dis. Its my dear Leila."
She did not respond or look back, but just kept walking. The knight kept mumbling as he stumbled drunkenly towards her, a hidious grin plastered on his face. I could see he meant no good as he shot out a hand and clamped it over her shoulder and spun her about to face him. "So... You think you'll juzz leeeve me ly thah? Afterall I did for you?"
She kept her lips tightly shut, but I saw the fear in her eyes as she struggled to get free. I myself was rooted to the spot in shock and horror. Surely he would not do anything, it was just drunken mutterings. The cold chill creeping down my back told me otherwise.
He raised his other hand to her face and clumsily stroked her cheek. "I still love you Leila. Come back with me, please."
She closed her eyes and said so quietly so that I almost missed her words, "No Tom, I cannot. You are a good man deep inside but you cannot be faithful to me once before."
His eyes grew hot with rage and he slapped her so hard I winced with the sound of the blow. She did not utter a single cry as her cheek reddened from the blow. "You ungreatful little bitch!" he roared. "It is not your place to question what I do. You are nothing but a common wench. I'm the one who gave you this nice dress..." he looked her up and down, an evil glint in his eyes.
I tried to run to them, to help, to do something. The noble and just knight, surely this was the alcohol talking, it couldn't be one of the men I had admired all my life.
Lowering his hand from her face to the front of her silken gown, he suddenly pulled her forward and there was a ripping sound as her dress fell in tatters. The knight and his two companions roared with drunken laughter and I watched with horror and sickening shock as the knight wronged the young woman and then, still laughing uproariously, he stabbed her in the chest.
My fury at this horrible act broke, I am not sure of what happened next, but the next thing I knew, I had run down to the crumpled pair on the ground, reached down to the knight who lay grinning up at the sky and grabbed his sword by the hilt. Pulling the blade free from its scabbard, I raised the sword and brought it down in a thrusting stab and barried the blade deep in the man's chest.
He gurgled in surprise, then lay still. His two companions, horrified at what had just happened tried to stop me and wrest the blade from my grasp. I was filled with rage and grief at the horrors I had witnessed and spun, slashing like a madman with the sword in my hand.
When I looked down, I saw the two other knights lying slashed and mutalated on the ground.
I sank to my knees next to the body of the young woman and put my head in my hands.
It must have been only minutes, for when I raised my swolen eyes, I heard running footsteps coming from the direction of the tavern. Dropping the blood coated sword, I ran back home, stopping at the community fountain to wash off the blood.
Leaving the pinkish water behind, I ran back home and into my room.
For the next two years, my life was a constant grayness. I did not want to join the knighthood of solamnics anymore, by the acts of that one man on that terrible night, I had been shaken.
I saw more solamnic knights drunk again and I was disappointed.
When I was eighteen, my mother and father fell mortally ill and died. My rage grew, for I believed it to be a curse cast upon me by some vengeful god of the solamnics because I had killed their knights and abandoned their cause.
I did not care, my 2 sisters quickly followed my parents and my two brothers, sick with grief, threw themselves off the docks one day.
I was the last of my family left alive.
Then, one day, when the knights of Takhisis entered and occupied the city, I was brought out of my stooperlike lethargy and was awed and amazed beyond belief.
These men, who people called evil and the enemy, where honorable and disciplined.
They were harsh but just. I knew then that my destiny waws still to become a knight, but instead of a solamnic, I would become a knight in the service of her dark majesty.
And so your excellency, I am here. If this has been a long and boring tale, I apologise but I thought you should know all of it.
When I applied for entry to the knighthood, I changed my name. I would take on a new name and a new life, no more would I be Jerrid Silverstein, I would become Jerrid Shadowsong, knight of Takhisis.
Now that you know my full history, I will not take up anymore of your time my lady. I hope you are well.
All hail Takhisis, Queen of Darkness.
Signed, Jerrid Shadowsong, supplicant to the knighthood of darkness.

Large, almond shaped eyes, hued in a sea green, peer out from under a hood,
studying the movements of those nearby. Skin tinged a dark blue, deriving
from his sea elf heritage, betrays his race. Long, pointed ears, poking out
of straight, white hair that flows to his upper back, further display what
he is. Then there are the gills under his earring adorned ears. The
earrings are several silver hoops in each ear. Though he holds a full and
firm stature, it is obviously he has endured a lot of pain through some
measure or another, as some of his movements suggest not all the wounds
have healed. Covered in simple leathers, and an open black robe, he
adorns the attire more out of "modesty" than anything else. Though he

He grips onto a spear, which he occasionally uses as a walking staff,

Text
Morgion/Zeboim, 
 
I am writing to express my interest in a position as a Leader for the Black
Order - Krynn's Darkest Organization. I am confident that I am fully experienced 
and uniquely qualified to take on the duties and responsibilities of this
position. I am the best person for the spot because of my qualifications 
in two invaluable categories.
 
Experience - My roleplay experience is equal to or greater than any other
 applicant, giving me the edge when making real-world decisions about a 
In-Character decision as well. Simply stated, I have either taken, or am 
currently enrolled in, an immortal spot (yours). This experience has not
only have helped me amass knowledge of Black Order theories and ethics, 
but also have provided countless hands-on hours of reporting, writing,
and editing stories.
 
My experiences as an immortal and a hero character have also given me 
extensive opportunity to develop and tweak my skills in the professional 
environment of a MUD admin. My education in the parallel field of 
communication also has cultivated my knowledge and skills as an 
interpersonal communicator, problem solver, social scientist,
and conflict manager. I know at this current time my character is not
a hero or of any status but I am quickly remedying that.
 
Character - This is an essential component of a leadership candidate.
 I am already a leader outside of this game, as demonstrated by my 
roleplay success and my involvement and leadership roles in various
 "extracurricular" activities and programs here on Krynn.
 I believe that my peers respect me. More importantly, I respect my peers.
 I believe that these leadership roles are just that - teams - where each
 member is as important as the next.
 
My experience and leadership character make me the best candidate 
for the remaining leadership role as I once ran the clan by myself as both
the Nightmaster, and Morgion.
 
Zeboim has logs to show some of my roleplay and I'm sorry we have not had
a chance to talk in the time I've been playing, you were sick.
 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
You can reach me at my email or in note on the game.
My email is Morgion85@yahoo.com (please don't think I
am trying to take over your immortal position Morgion, I'm not)

Subject Takhisis Departure~
Text
For those who read Takhisis's note, I apologize for her behaviour.  It
was pretty selfish and patronizing.  She obviously could not accept NOT
being able to "run" the MUD without having commands to threaten with.  I'm
actually even more surprised to know that she's able to run any kind of
business and actually keep employees with here with that kind of attitude. 
I don't think I've seen a bigger "I'm a big baby" display of attitude since
I've opened this MUD.  Of course, maybe having her own business is about the
only true place she can survive.  Because after that display, I know there's
no way in hell she'd survive in any real employment position.  Just like the
way the real world works, I do NOT promote based on length of time here. Just
ask Zivilyn and Sargonnas about that.  Both of them have been here longer than
Takhisis was, and she was still given a promotion to 110 before them.  I had
promoted her based on her performance because she actually used to be very
good at what she did.  I'm not sure what the hell happened that caused her to
jump up on the high horse she was riding around on, but her actions was a
very big reason for why I chose to move the staff into a new direction with
less emphasis based around level, and more around responsibilities instead.
 
I understand that some of you do not yet fully understand how I'm going to
implement the new staffing structure, but it is for the better.  It will all
be layed out here soon; of course now I will have to make a huge change in
the layout I already have built up, so that set me back a little, but not to
worry, it will be here soon.
 
Folks, if you don't want to be here, that's fine.  You don't owe me a reason.
I give people chances to be an Immortal here because they have fun being here
(and they want to be here), they want to help out even more and feel the next
step for them is doing so as part of our Staff.  I don't give people their
Immortal rank to use as a tool to control people.  I don't care what level
someone is, if I see those kinds of actions, there will be consequences.  We
want everyone to enjoy their experience; come here to get away from the real
world and delve into fantasy.
 
So for those who will be put into leadership roles, you will be given certain
tools at your disposal that will help you lead.  You just won't have a "level"
to do it.  If anyone has any questions, you're always welcome to come talk
to me.  Zeboim has been generous enough to purchase a Ventrillo server.  I
would highly recommend downloading the client and getting a headset.  These
days it's easier to do and costs very little.  Talking in Ventrillo can
sometimes alleviate the issues we have when communicating business via text.
So if you see me on here and would like to chat live, just let me know and
we can log into ventrillo to do so.

Subject The Corruption~
Text
"{WWill there be anything else, my Lady?{x" asks Joffrey, a butler and regular visitor to Maria's room at the Rendar estate. Without saying a word, the woman gives him a dismissing wave which is acknowledged with a quick bow and his leave. Maria bites her lip in aggrevation. She has spent the majority of her time in these most recent years in that room; writing, reading, avoiding everything and every one. She has grown into a
young woman at this point, her physique matching that of her mother in her prime. Unlike her mother and others of this high birth, she does not dress the part- opting instead to keep it simple with a plain white dress fitting her form snuggly with a lite knee-length skirt hanging down.
 
She didn't want to do anything, she didn't want to socialize- not since the death of Eul, a red chromatic dragon that she discovered in the name of the Aesthetics but ended up raising herself. Maria holds onto one of his scales for good luck, it is small and tucked inside the cup of her dress despite others disapproving of this spot, she feels like it deserves to be close to her heart. Maria has her former self to thank for 
 
this- Eulicia, the dragons namesake even, had injured and left him to bleed out, perfectly timed for Maria's arrival from town. It was claimed that it was done as per the Knight's request, as Eulicia hadn't the free will to do it for herself, because of the dragons ignoring the demands of his queen.
 
In her mother's sickness, Maria has kept her distance even more from the judgements and expectations of those both in the estate and out. Keeping her pain inside and not speaking about it, Maria cares little of news and dismisses anyone who tries to deliver any. It came to the point that it was almost forgotten she was in her room, or even on the estate, for those years when she grew.
 
She often catches a glimpse of her former self in the mirror, either out of the corner of her eye or in a tired daze. The first time resulted in a broken mirror, shattered by a frightened fist. Looking down at a bleeding hand, she hears, "{DWhat's the matter?{x" Eulicia's voice asked, "{DWould you truly reject who you are?{x" The voice was like an echo through the room, but as it was once her own it was at the same time so 
similar to inner monologue. This happens many times a week, the voice taunting her, but never is a source found- Maria, over time, accepts this voice as her own, believing she is struggling on the inside between her new and old selves. Perhaps if she still had Eul to rest against at night her heart wouldn't waver this easily.
 
"{mJoffry,{x" Maria utters as the servant begins to leave after laying down a silver platter with dinner, "{mWhat do you think of your life?{x" The question perplexed the man who looks around the room awkwardly for a moment, "{mIf you could do anything, would you still be here?{x" she adds. 
 
"{WMy Lady, that's.. a weird question to ask. What I can say, however, is that your family has treated me well- not a bad soul in sight.{x" Maria nods out of necessity, unsure of what to say. "{mIs life not what one makes of it? Why would you choose to be a servant, for example, when so many other things would make you
happier?{X" The man has a chuckle, thinking this young adult is simply sheltered, but after a moment he tries to explain, "{WThings that we have to do comes before things we want to do, my Lady. I do this now so I can do what I want at a later time.. don't worry, though, there's no reason for you to be limited.{x"
 
Even though the answer didn't help her at all, Maria thanks the man who promptly takes his leave. She crosses her arms on the table in front of her and lays her chin on the shoulders, talking to herself, "{mif I can do anything in this life that I want, why am I struggling so much against.. myself?{x" "{DBecause you cannot escape the shadows of your soul by popping it out of a different mother.{x" "{mShadow within or not,
if I choose a different way, I have the free Will to do so, right?{x" "{DFree Will? Think back, when have you ever done or seen an action that wasn't influenced or demanded of them?{x" "{mIt's silly to believe that one makes no decisions for themselves. You are a close minded, dark, and holding me back!{x" "{DThen use that 'Free Will' of yours and bid me gone- that is, unless you have doubts.{x" Maria growls, for she does 
doubt that she can escape the burdens of her past, she doubts she can let it go. But she decides that night that she is going to try.

To the various Children of Zura within the Order:
 
I, Karamae, write this missive for reasons two fold. Firstly, explaining my position within the order. Secondly, to bring to light a "treaty" that has been worked.
 
To start off, I am now in command of Zura's actions, within this Order, upon Ansalon. Orders and dictations will be coming from me, and from me alone. Any whom question my edicts will be dealt with accordingly, as I will see it as a traitorous act upon Zura, and Zura is as unforgiving as I am, and we both have our ways of dealing with the unfaithful.
 
I ask only for faith in Zura, as well as acceptance that I will operate in Her best interests. That being said, any overt action taken that could directly lead back to myself, or to the Order, without proper governance will, also, be dealt with. In a gruesome fashion. If any among you doubt this... test my patience and see what becomes of you. We are to operate from within the shadows, working Zura's goals.
 
That being said, choose your puppets wisely, for I expect regular updates on information gleaned from others. Firstly, I require a network of information established, open flow, so I, myself, and my Hands, have the adequate knowledge to operate, seeking targets of opportunity, to cause discord where possible, to better work enshrouded.
 
Secondly, in light of establishing this network, it allows us a position of power over others. Blackmail, extortion, murder... all worked to further our, and Zura's, goals.
 
To the second point of this missive: a "treaty" has been established with the Dark Knights, through course of two meetings with the Lady of Night. Until otherwise stated, any action taken against the Dark Knights will result in the swift recourse of death. I will not ask questions, the moment one of you do anything to hamper this, you will meet Zura faster than you had anticipated, if She even accepts you.
 
The reasons for this are two-fold: First, it allows us, in reference of earlier, to work within the shadows of the inexorable swath of destruction that is the Dark Knights. The more ground they gain, and control, the more freedom we have to do perform our business, and the less eyes are upon us. The Lady of Night has been specifically informed of this, and does not question it.
 
Second, we can see the weaknesses that the Dark Knights reveal, so we may later exploit them to our benefit. If the Dark Knights themselves reveal weakness, I am more than apt to play upon it, as well. Until such a time, we will offer aid, as required, so the Dark Knights may think they have some form of control over anything.
 
The benefits of this: the Dark Knights relinquish all control of the Seas to us, so that we may combat Abukku unquestioned, and establish our domination of Zura's first realm, over the Kingfisher. Ultimately, we will see the Storm brought forth, and all of Ansalon buried beneath the waves of Zura's Glory. In return, we will provide the Dark Knights with intelligence of Solamnia, and it's various cities. The Lady of Night isn't bold, but she is keen of mind.
 
Any questions can be directed to myself. Otherwise, holding of peace will be taken as acceptance, and punishments will be swift and severe. Maintain faith in Zura, but have trust in me, for I will lead us to glory, and see Her will gain power!

I request that you take the time to review this missive and my enclosed

Magic, and even Death. I will be taking the time to allow our Brotherhood 
to voice their opinions and allow for a group discussion without seeming to 
lecture and dull you in rotten notions.
 
This Pantheon means that I get more respect from my Brothers and 
Sisters which in turn means that they will work harder to get the task 
completed. In order to lead, you have to know how to follow first. For this 
reason, I know that I would be an asset to you all.
 
I know that a meeting would help you to understand my experience more

Morning comes, Maria already awake to greet it, a small sack thrown over her shoulder. 'How does one become certain of something? How do you know something so absolutely that your will can not be shaken?' was the question presented to the girl. 'By seeing it the reasons for it being true with your own eyes' was the answer she came up with; thus she seen that her truths weren't tucked away in the receses of her own mind,
but actually out in the world. She needed to get out there and find it- for if she did not find the proof she needed, this looming darkness in her soul would haunt her from now on.
 
The girl sneaks out of her room via the window, climbing down a wooden fence situated against the house for vines and roses to spread upon. She sticks to the shadows, not wanting her departure to be known. "{DFeels good being home again, doesn't it, the places light can't reach?{x" "{mShut up.{x" Circling along the side of the estate, she approaches the front countyard where she overhears some guards talking amoungst
themselves. "{WDid you hear how she is bed-ridden?{x" one asks another. Maria leaves the two behind instead of listening, thinking the conversation of little importance, while it was referencing her own mother.
 
After getting off the estate, it doesn't take the girl long to make her way into Solanthus nearby, picking up both a strong horse and some extra supplies. "{DOkay then, smartass, now where are you going to go? Do you even know?{x" "{mI don't, but in a way that's the beauty of it.{x" The townsfolk casually step aside as 
the horse-back woman makes her way towards the gate, some even bowing their heads in respect. Some recognize her as the youngest Chaslor child, others want to avoid conflict with what appears to be a noble, and some simple copy what those around them are doing out of a feeling of necessity.
 
"{DWhere is their free will here, 'Maria'? Would you bow your head to someone you know nothing of and has done nothing notable, if you had the choice?{x" "{mWe all adhire to the social stigmas freely to avoid persecution, such a thing is natural, to seek acceptance.{x" "{DAnd in doing so, by wanting to conform into the larger group, do you lose your individuality?{x" "{mPerhaps a little.{x" she admits this to herself as 
her new steed gallops over a wooden bridge out of the city, headed southwest towards Port-O-Call.
 
On the road, she meets many passerby's, most of the time a simply nod of the head is needed as a show of mutual respect and acknowledgement. Some men give her a warm while, this silky skinned noble woman traveling along a bumpy road all alone. She could take care of herself, she knew, so worry of such a thing did not
cross her mind. "{DLoving the attention, Chaslor Slut?{x" Maria growls at the reference that it made, replying simply "{mDon't be jealous that it's more than you ever got.{x" It offered no reply.
 
The day quickly fades as she arrives in the port town. Maria remembers that once Allyria talked about owning the inn there. Deciding to stay there, she orders some biscuits and gravy, served in a sloppy but delicious manner from the cooks downstairs. You could feel the amount of use that the beds have been through upon
laying down on them, but Maria didn't mind- a bed was a bed and it serves the purpose just fine. "{mBetter than the stone tablets and cold grounds I once slept on, at the very least,{x" she thought to herself. The girl falls into a deep sleep rather quickly.

Sunrise comes quickly, Maria leaving as a wave of light sweeps the area, some dew still hugging the ground attempting to hold tightly for just a few more minutes. She leaves west from the inn, intending to find the intersection and make her way down to the boats, however something catches her eye. It was an empty graveyard on a memorial-like hill to the north. It seemed deserted and dark, none of the citizans seem to be
headed in that direction. "{mI wonder why no one visits graves of their loved ones,{x" "{DBecause we all want to avoid death, we don't want to think about something that's inevitable, we want to deny something that's natural- just like you're doing.{x" "{mOr perhaps they make the choice to not feel the pain of the memories that place offers. It's the remnants of a war afterall, home of the tomb of the Unknown Hero.{x"
 
The road leading to the graves was long and cold, covered in dust and not a single print to be seen. The iron gate of the entrance creeks open, obviously not been used in quiet some time. Maria enters, to her shock finding ghosts. Many of them, they hover around the graves as if stuck in that spot. The girl settles quickly, having seen stranger beings before. Each ghost was unique, some adorning spectral Solamnic armor of
old, many of which were damaged, pierced, or bloody. "{mSoldiers who refuse to die?{x" "{DPerhaps. Many were forcefully drafted, stuffed into some armor, and put into the battlefield. They're only right to reject their fate with their whole being. Where was their choice?{x"
 
The girl frowns, unable to combat the idea. She moves from grave to grave, looking at the names and acknowledging the dosle spirit above it, thanking them for their service. "{DDo you think that means anything to them, if they even know what you're saying?{x" "{mDoes it matter?{x" She moves about till she 
finds a tomb, the title of 'Unknown Hero' etched into the stone above the entrance. Inside, a elderly spectral Solamnic sits, hovering, in mid-air as if there is a chair under him. His sword drawn and stuck into the ground next to him, a hand resting on it, he looks to be weeping.
 
"{mI guess each has their own reason for not letting go- let it be regret, hatred, or even love.{x" "{DDeath, in any case, was unacceptable to these soldiers, else they wouldn't have stayed. Where is the free will you speak of, the power to change your fate and make your own decisions, if you can't even help the way you die?{x" "{mNo one can control how they die, don't be silly.. but they can control the way they live,
what's left behind. In many cases, you're not able to achieve what you wanted to in time, that in of itself in unfair and something you can't escape, however-{x" "{DSo you admit it's pointless to fight?{x" "{mHOWEVER- as I was saying, that doesn't keep you from having the will to fight to achieve it- whatever it may be.{x" "{DThere's no talking sense to you, time in the womb has taken away the wisdom you once had.{x"
 
Maria departs from the graveyard and heads south towards the port, leaving behind twisted forms of a men's souls, some weeping, some howling out in anger, pain, or even disbelief. This solved nothing for her, it was proof of neither the strength of ones soul nor the inevitability of ones fate- it was simply what it was, a sad circumstance for individuals plucked away from the world, leaving behind too much to let go.

Hiddukel,
 
Dulthan is Sebastian's new character and I'm concerned about a few things.
One being that every time he plays my characters get deleted.
Two, he is not here for fun, he is here to make others have a headache.
He is far too busy in his day to properly RP and has already shown
disrespect to the staff. While we are seperated and not living together
I fear that his bullshit will run off on me. For this reason I am avoiding
all characters and association with him. Please do not restore his character
for I fear it will cause what you call 'bad blood'.
 
My other concerns is that he may have alterior motives once he levels.
I will include a log if such an event occurs but I urge you to please
take notice of him and notify the staff of his return. They do not
need to be threatened or disrespected.
 
I hope that you will see that most often it is his mouth that ruins
my fun here on your game, and it also causes players to have a bad
taste in their mouths. Just let the staff know to keep an eye out.

The port road seems empty when Maria returns to it, headed south towards the boats. Citizens eye her carefully as she exits the graveyard, fearful of anything that may have followed her, she assumed. "All aboard! The ship departs in one minute!" rings a powerful voice, echoing as it bounces off the houses on 
either side of the port road. Maria arrives in a rush, her beautiful white dress now dirtied by dust and dirt kicked up both in the graveyard and on the road. 
 
A small bow to the captain, Maria begins "{mMay I-{x" but is stopped short. Captain Ferrel crooks his brow, towering above the young woman, eyeing her, "{WNot you,{x" he says. He explains, "{WThis ship is for the commons, I don't think you want to get on, lass.{X" Maria squints her eyes at the man, a little shocked. The
captain simply turns, shouting down the road towards the bustling marketplace once more, "Last call! The ship is departing!" His eyes return to Maria with a tug of his clothing, "{mMay I board?{x" she asks. 
 
With a sigh, the man starts again, "{WAs I said, this boat-{x" but is cut off similarily to how he just did. "{mNo,{x" says Maria, "{mA boat is a boat, a person in need is as of much importance as the next. I want to board.{x" A heavy sigh leaves the man, "{WYou're young.. you haven't seen how the commons are 
treated by.. those in better positions, I'm looking out for you here, kid.{x" The captain starts to turn around, taking a step towards the drawbridge.
Maria lowers her head in a bit of shame. "{mNobility.. more of a curse to the practical than it is a blessing.{x" "{DIt was once seen as something that would be a blessing. Now that you have it, maybe you can appreciate just how good our.. old life was.{x" "{mThat's not me anymore.{x" "{DIt is, you just don't know 
it yet.{x" "{mI've chosen to leave it.{x" "{DYou've chosen to life in denial for a bit, you'll come to your senses.{x" "{mI will prove that it's in my power.{x"
Many hours pass, the sun now high into the sky. The Captain takes some heavy footsteps off the boat, a sigh escapes his tired throat before he shouts "{WNow boarding! One way trip to Abanasinia!{x" Sitting on the stone ground nearby was Maria, holding her knees to her chest in an attempt to stay warm. She stands, and
makes her way to the captain who immediatley notices the familiar face. He crooks a brow once more, looking over the girl who now is wearing common worn clothing, the white dress laying in the dirt over in her corner.
 
"{mMay I board?{x" she asks the man. Ferrel closes his eyes with a smile then simply nods his head.

The boat ride went smoothly, not one messed with the pale skinned woman, though she got some strange looks. Sitting up against the side of the ship, the only one to interact with the woman was a young girl that apparently loved Maria's hair, insisting on playing with it and making some braids. Her long, clean, black 
hair was good for this, and she let the child do as she wished while the time passed. "{GWe never get our hair this smooth back at home,{x" the girl says, referring to how easily her fingers slip through Maria's hair.
 
Through some conversation, she learns a little about the girl. The fact that she lives in the slums of Solanthus, how her family were hoping to find better paying work across the sea, their old lifestyle, etc. It was quiet the saddening tale, Maria not speaking to reply to the girl, simply allowing her to rant on. 
 
"{mMany are born to an unfair life.{x" "{DBut if they just believe, then it's a good life, right? By your logic at the least.{x" "{mDid I really used to be that stupid? It's different and you know it.{x" "{DJust making a point. They can't escape their own poverty as much as you can escape the heart you were born to.{x"
 
The distant land comes into view as this internal conversation goes on, an adult woman walking over. "{gOh, I'm so sorry, did she bother you?{x" she asks Maria, referring to her daughter. "{mOh, no no, she was very good company on such a boring trip.{x" Maria replies, "{mBut.. I couldn't help but hear that you are going 
through a lot of trouble, is that true?{x" The mother scowls at her daughter of just hides her face, "{gYes..{x" she begins, "{gbut don't let it concern you, we are all just trying to make it by. Nothing special.{x" 
 
Maria nods, lifting the sleeve of her raggidy shirt she picked up in port-o-call. "{mHere,{x" she says, taking off a choker she put on her wrist, of the Chaslor family crest. "{mTake the boat back, travel north a days ride to the rendar estate, give them this to them and say you found it.{X" The woman looks confused but 
holds out her hands anyways, "{mOne time someone did that, instead of pawning it, and my family was impressed enough to reward them, you see..{x"
 
"{gYour family?{x" she woman asks as she looks at the symbol. Immediately grabbing her daughters arm, she yanks the child away from behind Maria, "{gI am so sorry that she bothered you!{X" she said loudly, backing away and bowing her head. The spectical turns some heads, eyes now falling on Maria curiously. "{mNo, no, I'm not-{x" Maria begins, only for the mother to scurry off into a growing crowd. 
 
"{rBoys, we got a noble on the deck!{x" a man shouts, the crowd getting closer. She starts getting shoved side to side, some shouting curses to those of high birth, others begging for some form of help. Maria shouts at them to stop, only to hear mocks between all the ongoing shouts along the lines of how weak she must be with flawless skin and such.

The wooden floors of the ship vibrate a little, the captain leaping over the rail of the platform above onto the deck. The words fall silent, hands grabbing Maria's clothes violently let go, and eyes shift to the towering captain. "{WNow I know most of you are moving cause of the corruption in the city, that most of you 
must hate the nobles for this,{x" he thunders to everyone, "{WBut you will not harass this young woman who had nothing to do with it JUST because she is of high birth.{x"
 
"{rShe mocks us! Riding on this and wearing rags, when she could have-{x" was said before being drowned out by cries of cruelty, their houses being seized, etc. One man was brave enough to push through the crowd and make a, what seemed to be, lunge at the girl. Having been annoyed with all the shoving, shouting, and 
accusations, Maria let out a low growl as she saw the man coming. A rage boiled as he emerged from the crowd, a hand extended out towards her. 
 
In the blink of an eye, Maria made her way to his side, lowered to the ground and with a swift kick to the back of his leg he begins to fall backwards. He had no time to react, he saw her.. then he didn't, in the middle of a day on an open deck. The sky was in his vision now as he falls, Maria's left hand catching his
throat and accelerating his fall with a thrust, a cracking sound from the wooden deck heard as it collides with impact. Her head immediatley raises to look at the others, a bloodlust seen in her eyes as they back away astonished. 
 
"{DMmmm that feels good. Doesn't it?{x" the voice asks. Maria looks down, then up, as whispers are spread. She's crazy, they thought. "{mNo.. it doesn't.{x" she tells herself, letting go of the mans neck, the captain already on his way over. Leaning down, he inspects the man who's coughing, five marks on his throat from each 
fingernail that pierced the skin a bit. "{WHe'll be fine,{x" the captain says, broken by a "{GDADDY!{X" from the crowd.
 
The girl from earlier made her way through, and got on the ground next to the man asking if he was alright. "{GHe was coming to defend you,{x" she said, "{GBecause we thought you were a good person. I guess we were wrong.{x"
 
The rest of the trip goes by uneventfully. Maria is against the side of the ship, and never does anyone come close. "{mI'm.. not a bad person. I'm a good person now.{x" "{DA good person that likes to hurt others.{x" "{mI don't.. I was defending myself..{x" "{DAgainst what, a dirty man in rags, with no weapon? You've fought 
dragons and undead legions, he was of no threat.{x" "{mI.. you're right.{x" "{DI've been right all this time.{x" "{mPerhaps you have.{x"

"{WWake up, get your shit, and get off! Welcome to Abanasinia!{x" shouts the captain upon docking. Maria takes a moment to finally budge, she had sat in a single position for quiet some time, she had grown stiff. By the time she stood, she hears the captains voice once more, "{WChaslor,{x" he states in a burly voice, "{WHang on a second.{x"
 
Maria waits for the man for a few minutes as he helps guide people and give directions to those departing. When he finally comes over, he wastes no time speaking his mind. "{WThat was quiet the show you put on for everyone. On the record, I hope to not see you on my ship again.{x" The words hurt Maria more than he knew; she didn't want to acknowledge the fact that she had done bad.
 
"{WHowever, off the record, you have my deepest respects. You did what I haven't seen a single high born child do- threw away what makes them different and progressed forward on your own terms. Stay strong kid.{x" The towering man nods his head in a slight bow before turning and stomping off to the helm. Maria stood there, not really knowing how to respond. 
 
"{DProgress? What progress, I am but a few days from home, have hurt the innocent, slept in filth, and not an ounce of knowledge to be gained from doing it.{x" "{mThere has been knowledge to be had, even if it wasn't what I was looking for. Puzzles pieces to the bigger picture.{x" 
 
Maria's thoughts were interupted by a tug on her shirt. Turning, a small group stands before her, a man, woman, and child. She recognizes them immediately, the child and her mother. The marks on the mans neck grow darker, it is obvious that the muscles are going to bruise. "{GDaddy wanted to talk to you,{x" stated the girl.
 
Maria looks at the man, her expression torn a bit with sadness upon sight of what she had done. Before he can speak, she blurts "{mI'm so sorry,{x" and gives a deep bow from the waist. She hears some forced chuckles, a scratchy sound in his breathes. "{gNo, no, child. With all the excitement and threats, I imagine that me running up to ya would seem threatening. I shoulda' thought first, 'suppose.{x"
 
A weak smile forms on the girls lips, "{mI'm glad that you're not terribly upset. Your daughter is precious.. did you umm..{x" she begins, turning her gaze to the mother, "{mkeep that emblem? It would be a shame if you lost it in all the pushing and shoving.{x" The woman uncups her hands that had been pulled to her chest, "{gyes it's here.{x"
 
"{mGood.. good.. before I just thought about the little one, and perhaps being of help to her.. but now I have so much more reason. Take it as my apology-{x" she says, the mother obviously more upset than the father is and simply nods. "{gThank you.. but.. we are afraid of being seen as thieves.{x" says the father.
 
Maria shakes her head, "{mtake it to the rendar estate, it will be recognized there. They are good people, I know all the guards and butlers personally.. no harm will come to you. If there is any issues, ask for Joffry. He's worked there since my birth.. tell him I'll claw his eyes out if you aren't treated like personal guests.{x"
 
The man chuckles at the last line, and nods. The three walk back to their spot on the boat deck, Maria being rushed off as they need to board more for the return trip. "{DThey're low life commoners you're inviting to an estate. They will steal from you.{x" "{mI'll take that bet.{x" "{DWhat?{x" "{mThe bet that you will act in kind before doing that.{x" "{DYou nearly ripped killed him.{x" "{mHeh, yeah.{x"
 
"{mEven if they do, what does it matter?{x" "{DIn the past you would kill for the material gain they could steal in a few minutes.{x" "{mAtleast you admit that was a past life. I don't care about that now..{x" "{DWhat, now that you've had your pockets lined, you're bored with it?{x" "{mMaybe now that I've had it.. I've seen what little it really means to me.{x"
 
"{DSo do you have any idea where you're going yet?{x" her voice asks while Maria leaves the port and get on the road. "{mWest,{x" Maria states simply. "{mI only brought enough to last me a couple more days. It should be enough time to get the shrine then back home.{x"

Maria makes her way through the town of Xak Tsaroth, the market district and outer gate laying between her and to the road west. The market is packed with all kinds of business- some shady, some not. Draconians wonder about, most cloaked as to hide their form, the humans and draconians subtly avoid each other going from stall to stall.
 
It doesn't take long for the girl to make it through. Presumably because of the rags she wore, she was viewed as a beggar or just another slums child moving about. Only the stall owners paid her mind, even then only to make sure the child didn't have sticky fingers.
 
The road is rough, leading to the Abanasinian Forest where the crossroads fork off to every direction. Maria had planned on catching the road south towards Qualinesti and visiting the folks at Branchala's shrine- who once helped her find her way in life. However, the voice of Eulicia strikes out at her with every step.
 
"{DYou're hungry.{x" "{mI am..{x" "{DYou're tired..{x" "{mI am..{x" "{DYour feet are starting to hurt...{x" "{mYep...{x" "{DStop.. go home.{x" Maria sighs, turning around to look at the road behind her, between the brush she can see Xak Tsaroth in the distance. "{DYou have nothing out there for you. You owe no one all this trouble.{x" "{mI owe it to myself, for the life I want to have.{x"
 
A cry is heard in the distance. The kind of cry an animal makes before death. Maria quickely motions for the frightened horse to stay, scurrying silently along the ground towards the sound. The grass was tall but spread out, the tree's wide but far inbetween, nearly perfect for staying camoflauged on approach. Soon enough, before her was the result of a small hunt.
 
A strong antelope lay on the ground, pinned by the neck by a white tiger. It looks to be suffocating under the pressure of the cat's mighty jaw. Pity is the girls first instinct, she jolts from behind a tree, waving a hand towards the area behind her while running towards the pair. A rip forms where she stood, the tiger pulled from the other side, ripped away from the prey.
 
The tiger snarls from afar as Maria arrives at the antelope, dropping to her knees and looking over the beast. "{DIt's going to die.{x" "{mNo, I can help it.{x" "{DThis is death, not a fairy tale in your head where everyones a good guy.{x" Blood continues to seep out of the puncture holes in the antelopes neck, it hardly raises its head enough to look at the girl. Strength in its eyes were fading.
 
"{DWhat is that annoying buzzing?{x" "{mI don't hea-{x" a small sound seems to be buzzing in the distance, coming into Maria's awareness. It's not the tiger who still snarls from its summoned location, not sure on what to do. It's not this dying antelope, or anything she's head from any animals for that matter. It's music.. yes, that's deffinitely music.
 
A drum.. and a flute.. The tempo seems to be slowing, Maria looks towards the road; there's no one in that distance. It grows louder. "{DWHAT IS THAT, IT'S SO-{x" was the last words Maria heard, the sounds drowning her out. It's coming from the antelope. Maria is bright, she's educated and has wisdom beyond her years.. it doesn't take her long to realise.. it's the antelopes death song.
 
Looking over to the predator, the tempo changes, more instruments come into play, it is a confused ballad of adrenaline and desperation. The bush behind it shakes a bit, two small cubs emerging, cute little growls following their mothers. There is a moment of revelation to the girl.
 
"{mThis one's song is coming to an end, for the sake of theres to continue. I.. I was wrong to interfere, they must play their natural course.{x" Standing, Maria keeps her eyes on the predator as it twitches in responce to her movement. Ever more defensive and aggressive, it seems willing to fight over the meal. Maria closes her eyes for a moment and bows her head, backing away from the prey as it whimpers.
 
For a few minutes afterward, not a word was spoken by her alter. All that was heard was the world around her. The grass sways to the breeze, leaves fall gracefully and cover the ground in autumn hues, life and death sway back and forth, in many forms, all around. It all consolidates to a harmonious song of nature. For the first time in awhile, everything made sense, and there was no questioning.
 
This peace- how is it obtained.. and how do I make it last?

Just a quick reminder about Mantis.  Please feel free to sign up and use
it.  It's a very good BUG tracker system that can also be used for project
management as well.  If you see something posted on the forums with regards
to BUGs or new ideas, please feel free to add them to Mantis.  If they are
BUGs or Typos, go ahead and delete the thread from the forum.  
 
Also, with regards to BUGs and Typos, please make sure that you enter the VNUM
of the rooms, mobs, and objects.  If you just put in descriptions, that
doesn't help for shit.  Need the virtual numbers in there.  Also, be sure that
you read through any and all Mantis tickets already out there that have not
been completed, that way we can avoid having duplicates.

My niece, Ciara, has told me you are devoted to Hiddukel.  Through some
RP it is now apparent to Agravain he is in need of devoting to the God of
Greed and not to who I was originally devoting to.  Is there a shrine
somewhere other than the one in the thieves hall?  If not...  How do I get
back into the hall?  LOL Thanks for you attention to this...  OR kill me and
drag my body into an alley somewhere.  Whichever you prefer.

As many of you are aware, there's some restructuring going on here at LoK.
We had one person quit, and a couple of people who've always been on the
fence for a while.  With that being said, and with how I plan to restructure
the staff, and with how we've been going through a slower time in the last
couple of months (was really active in the spring and summer, but then died
out some), some of you will be let go.
 
I don't like letting people go, but some people I feel haven't been really
active and only seem to show up just to show their face and update the time
stamp on their login, but never stick around unless there's a lot of people
already on.  We need active staff members who are willing to log in, even if
they're the only ones on; staff members who actively contribute to the MUD,
whether building areas, contributing to the Wiki, advertising to get new people
to play here, or just having a bunch of your mortal characters logged on, if
anything, just to make it appear that we have people actively playing.
 
I understand that some of you have special circumstances and that you would be
here all the time and contribute all the time if you could, but just so happens
that you can't.  Those of you that fall into this category will not be let go.
However, there's a handful of you that almost never contribute, not because
you can't, but more so because your heart just isn't in it.  I can understand
that.  This isn't being done as a punishment, so please don't take it that
way if you happen to be one of those who get cut.  I'm just trying to get this
MUD moving in a direction that's healthy for the MUD.  We need people who can
devote some of their time and actively contribute.
 
Not to worry however.  If you get cut, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a
permanent decision.  I would more than likely reconsider down the road if it
was deemed appropriate and re-hire you if you wanted back on.  I will also
NOT be deleting any of your mortal characters.  Everything else can remain as
usual.  We just need to get this MUD moving forward in the right direction.
MUDs (text based games in general) are starting to trend up again because a
lot of MMOs are starting to become redundant.  People are looking for something
more than the usual grind.  We want to be ready with LoK for that and need
to ensure that we keep a lean crew on board who's willing to put in the time
and energy.
 
If you need to come talk to me personally, my door is always open.

{D***A set of scrolls, meticulously copied, transcribed, and posted by the hand of monks, are painstakingly placed in areas of high traffic volume, so the largest available audience can read. The scrolls reads as follows...***{X
 
 
{BYou cry out for salvation? There is an answer. You seek a higher calling than just trudging through monotony, seemingly oblivious to the powers that be, and being overlooked your just due? You seek an order where you belong? Answers are out there, for those who seek them hard enough.
 
The answers are clear. Forsake your vows. Forsake your family. Join one who truly cares for you, not leaves you to rot in a gutter. Forsake a dull, boring life you once led, for it is meaningless. Band together under a single banner... a banner of strife and mischief... a banner of the seas! All have forsaken you, just as you should forsake them.
 
Overthrow the shackles of tyranny. Overthrow the lesser gods you once were so humbled by. A power is rising. A power that would welcome you. Rewards are vast. Secrets are gleaned. And among it all... you would rise to a kind of glory. But not glory as you know it, no. Not glory among your peers. But glory upon a Goddess who would see you utilized to your potential.
 
Merely cry out for salvation in the name of the Seas... in the name of Zeboim... and perhaps that salvation can, indeed, be granted. A Storm is coming. Let those who seek the salvation they rightly deserve... earn it in Her eyes, and Her eyes alone. Those who forsake Her will be swallowed by the coming Storm.{X
 
{D***None claim responsibility for this scroll, nor does it state there is a means to contact the individuals. Though all whom read it feel a set of eyes upon them, studying with interest in their coming actions.***{x

So I got this idea looking at Karamae's note this morning, and I wondered
if you guys could help me.  I'm manager of the FB page and I've been
struggling to come up with ideas on how to generate interest through it. 
This morning, after seeing Karamae's note, I thought it would be awesome to
have screenshots of recruitment letters posted up by each clan's leader. 
I'll be glad to write one for the Foresters and the Artisans.  I'll have the

support this idea and help me show the Facebook folks that Yes!!  We're

Since creating his character, he's written a fascinating story peeking into

Doesn't look like your note went through, sorry.  Could have been an

that doesn't matter anymore.  As far as Kiri's area, his area is being
inspected.  Zeboim has been made the new head builder and she's been going
through Kiri's area for some time now and from I understand, has already
been working with him on it.  So had I known your area was ready to go, I
would have definitely went through it, or asked Zeboim to do it, as she is

Hey, everyone.
 
I just wanted to thank everyone for being great the past few years, since I've become an immortal. However, I feel it is time for me to move on. I just don't have the time to devote to the game like I used to, nor do I really have the interest in taking an immortal role in the game anymore.
 
I wish everyone up here the best, and will try to get on my mortals from time to time as well. And, maybe, if I get interested again or the time I can devote picks up, I will reapply one day and hope for the best. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening in the forseeable future.
 
Thanks,

Subject A new bustle in the streets~
Text
No day on the Ansalon can ever be called a normal day, not since the
coming and the passing of the War of the Lance.  Draconians the dark
abominations of the Dark Queen were introduced to the World of Krynn, the
Gods that had once thought to have abandoned their beloved creatures
returned, unlikely heroes arose on both sides to fight.  Dark Clerics preach
the tainted songs of their Gods, somehow turning a few souls from the path
of the Rhigteous and down a path of destruction; others wrought new disease
of mind, soul and body, all the while promising the return of Darkness to
the world.  Armies rise, they march forward, meetings are called by those
who delve in the secret arts, alliances are made and new enemies are found;
the world has been shaken on its foundation.  Some have prospered, others
have fallen into poverty, simple men and women turned to begging, and
children who have no parents or home are turned to thieving; and murder
seems to be in every eye, and it seems to be at its highest point in the
City of Palanthas.  No, there has never been a day to be called normal, not
anymore.  And these past days, why should it be any different?  In the City
of Palanthas, an old plain monestary that once was thought to be abandoned
during the war, have now opened their wooden shutters; ancient bells once
again toll at intervals during the day naming the time for worship and
meditation.  This once thought-to-be-abandoned Monestary once again thrives
with its inhabitants whom had once shunned themselves from the outside
world, monks in plain burlap robes are seen coming and going from their
peaceful world they had retreated to.  Though the days of the world still
seem dark, especially in Palanthas, these monks have a smile on their faces
at all times, and peace radiates from them as they bustle about the city. 
Some of these peaceful monks can be seen with conversing with others of the
city, handing simplistic foodstuffs to those that are hungry, and sharing
words of wisdom with those that ask why they must suffer so.  Always the
same response, "Not one of us knows why, brother, but the question we must
ask is how we can grow from this tribulation."  Mothers who weep for their
children, and fathers who curse the heavens as they work to their death to
provide what little they can, seem to draw the monks ever more as their
numbers increase in the streets, their joyful faces warming the souls, "Come
with us" they beckon with warm smiles and open arms, "Come, to the house of
the Mantis, there will be beds and warm stew."  And as with every end of the
day, as the monks head back to their monestary, they leave the people of
Palanthas with the promise of enlightenment.  The fading words, still
echoing in the minds of the people, "come, come to the house of the
Mantis..."

He says he's quite the capable warrior.{x" The old man smirks to himself, giving you a wink.  
 
 
He hands the application over, which is sealed with the Bracchus family crest: a branch entwined with grape vines. When you crack it open there is a letter within, very plain and simple resume which is as follows: 
 
 
{x{W"Noble Sir, 
{WMy name is Barius Bracchus of Palanthas, my father is Sergio Bracchus, the attourney of Lord Cassius Bracchus-Palanthas. My family is a branch-family of the Bracchus line, which has a distinguished lineage dating back five-hundred years. 
 
{WI am a student of Law, apprenticed under my father for most of my life. I am also a student of the sword, having studied extensively at the Velius Academy of Warfare during the off-seasons of summer. I have decided, that instead of following my father's line of work, (I will leave that to my brothers), that I wish to join the Solamnic Knighthood. I wish to bring knowledge of Law, and a trained sword arm to bear in these troubled times. 
 
{WI thank you for considering my application.

A hush falls over the courtyard of Wayreth, the Towers of High Sorcery,
as cloud of black magic swirls and coalesces into a semi-solid form.  That
form slowly takes the shape of a piece of parchment -- not physical, but
ethereal in its substance.  Across the shadowy surface, bright green script
loops gracefully, as though an invisible hand is writing the missive.  It
reads: 
 
'{GFellow Magi of the High Orders of Sorcery,
 
The day has come that power should shift into the hands of another. 
Respectably, Archmagus Rayo Hereus has reliquished his title in order to
devote his attention to other things. He has left the position to
myself, the next in a line that holds much history; much glory.
 
I will not disappoint you.
 
I introduce myself, Ordermistress Natascha Kiralv, of the Black Robes.
Should any have need of the Black Robes, you will direct such matters to
myself.

I would like to roleplay at the level I am at, as an apprentice to a Knight, but I don't think the KoS has any members? What would be the point lol

Today, if only for a little while, try and do something that makes you
happy. Seven years ago today is when my Endocrinologist called to tell me
that the cancer was completely gone from my body. This is the first year
I've been able to say that I'm happy, and not still mad and bitter from the
whole thing. It's a big deal for me, a really big deal.
 
Most days I have half the energy as someone my age or even older. I'll be
this way for probably the rest of my life, and that's fine, I'm okay with
it now. It's still frustrating, but hey, I'm smiling today. Today, I'm
going to my second favorite place I like to be, the mountains. I'm going
to drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, blare my music, and hopefully see some
wildlife. I'm going to do what I want to do for a little while, and then
spend some more time in the mountains the next day with some peeps!
 
I feel like I'm back to my old self again, as close as I can be. And I've
missed this chick. It took me a long time to get here but I did. I'm
still just as complicated, even more so now, but I'm happy. I have a
roommate moving in next week, hopefully starting school again this summer,
and spending as much time as I possibly can with family I've reconnected
with and my best friends new family with a lil' baby girl.
 
So today (or when you read this), if only for a little while, be happy
about something.. anything. It's a special day, for me at least, but
special nonetheless. And if you happen to be in Milwaukee, WI area about
mid June, you should hit me up and celebrate with me. Seven years ago I
wondered if I'd make it past 30 and my doctors made sure I surpassed it.

A scroll materializes nearby, sealed with a black wax disc, the symbol of

  "{DMy fellow Conclavians,
 
While this message is mainly directed at those within the Black Robes, all
of the Conclave ought to be aware of the circumstances at hand. While we
all may not agree with the principles or activities of the Solamnic
Knighthood, rarely have we ever given them a reason to threaten our order.
We stand as guardians over the use of the Arcane -- that, in and of itself,
should ally our organizations against those who seek to abuse it for the
furthering of their chaotic gods.
 
However... It has come to my attention that a declaration has been made; if
any Black Robed mage were to be caught mingling with those of the Black
Order, we will all be treated as outlaws, and detained as they see fit.
 
While this is an outrage, I offer this as a warning -- do be wary of who
you associate with. For the Conclave has had little sway over the Solamnics'
ridiculous laws and detentions in the past, and we may have little to no
course of action to prove innocence or otherwise.{X

Hi Ardnas
It is great that you thought of us or you were guided toward us, unfortunately; there are two major reasons that lead us to decline your application:
1- The bard school is not a form of arcane magic, I know you are fierce and powerful, but your power comes from music, not from magic.
2- Quoting the help file of the conclave (help conclave2) "kender and magic are like oil and fire - a potentially dangerous combination. No kender has ever taken the Test of High Sorcery (nor does there seem to be any willingness among the wizards to allow a kender to take the Test). Though kender may be interested in the effects of magic, they are unable to summon the necessary focus required to master the magical arts."
With this said, it is with regret that I advise you to find another clan.
I am sorry that you were misguided, but there are many other clans that I am sure that will be more than glad to accept you on their ranks.
Have Fun!
Your friendly neighbor!

Hey there, Hiddukel. Remember me? I'd like to dive back into RPing in LoK, and was wondering whether you'd be able to restore my pfile. I know it's been a few years and that there's a good chance they've been lost or purged, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. I'll make the climb back to 101 if need be, but it'd help the continuity of the character and lend more weight to the RP (in my opinion) if I could get the "old Silynt" back. I look forward to hearing from you.

there is a cloaked thief in palanthas in the room before the building full of mage trainers. he drops a black wristband that is pretty good. but since he's a pain not many get it.
there is a mob in the palanthas library that drops a good shield for int.

Fyrah is leaning against a wall near the door, looking young as ever though you know it's a lie. He picks himself up with a small thrust and walks close. Before you can say anything he raises a hand; you notice a smile form before the gradual appearance of a piece of paper upright from his open palm blockes your view of his face. In the blink of an eye, in a red flash, he dissapears. An illusion being cancelled? He seemed real enough.. the paper floats down slowly to the ground and lays there.

Hello, Hidd said I need to talk to you about building.  Hidd approved me
a few years ago but I had lost my internet and so it didn't pan out at that
time.  I do have experience building though it has been a while but once I
get back in the swing of things it will all come back.  I specifically want
to build Sanction as an opposite of Palanthas for a hometown for evil
players.  I have done a lot of studying on Sanction and already have written
out most of the rooms, save for some of the road ways.  Afterwards I'd also
like to rebuild the KoT Clanhall as the current one is a throwback to the
Storm over Krynn (precursor to Legends of Krynn) days and is very lacking. 
Anyway hit me up when you get this and let me know if I can join the team. 
There hasn't been much done lately and I'd like to help change that.

Hi Luni,
 
I'm sorry I haven't been around recently. I hope to catch you on sometime soon so we can talk in person about your area.
 
In the meantime, you should be able to see any reset in an area that you have permission to edit by typing "resets". It'll list what resets are in the room, if any.
 
Don't worry about the BP. It has a mind of its own sometimes, and a crash doesn't mean the end of the world -- we just like to try to avoid them lol. If possible, when the BP crashes again, see if you can get in touch with Hidd and let him know. He can usually reboot it remotely.
 
If nothing else, I can review your area and send you a note on the BP so you're not completely stranded waiting for me. My schedule is a little strange lately and it has been keeping me away from Krynn more than I'd like.
 
Hope to talk to you soon!

Hello my love
It seems that our kids are starting to evade their cribs, I caught Eva wondering around in the room, alas Jacen wasn't anywhere in sight, I bet he crawled to bed with you.
Anyway, I am going to take Eva to a little flight around the city and maybe eat some Ice cream.
If I arrive later than usual do not worry, we are fine.
Lots of love
Your beloved husband
Shinzo Ajime
P.S. Eva sends you kisses.

Hello there. I don't know if you remember me, i'm a way back player. I've been always active, sometimes more then others, but that's life. Now i'm active daily, unemployed unfortunately. Do you want to give me a shot at being an IMM? I've always wanted that, since long time ago, years. I know from RL, Solinari.
Thank you, and i'll be waiting for an answer from you.

Hi to all. Yesterday night, i'm in a diferent time zone, Lunitari caught me using triggers. I'm not going to deny it, i use them. The only difference is that i use them, but i'm here in front of the computer, so i'm always here when the chars are online. Yesterday it was a special day, i had a fight with my wife, and completely forgot that the MUD was online, or it will never had been left on.
I'm sorry about this, this was my first time, but it has an explanation.

Hi to you all (Who still plays this). Lot's of you people must know me, i've been around for many years now. Well the porpose of this note was not this.
I just want to know, where is everyone?! I've been playing alot lately, since August, and unfortunately is sad to see no one around, only the same 3 people.
Hiddukel, if you read this, where and how are you man? You must try to show. If a so old player like me, stills showing up, i think this deserves a little more atention from everyone, and yes, i'm speaking to all the staff too.
Sorry about this, but i feel the need to say that it is sad the complete abandonment of this. This MUD is great, that's why a few of us keep returning.
 
Be well.

Halig,
 
I hope the holidays have treated you well. :) They have
certainly kept me occupied, what with all the family members
we visited. There was much eggnog and merrymaking, but little in
the way of internets.
 
As such, I wanted to let you know that Chislev and I have accepted
your application. You will be our new Reorx. :) I admire your
high hopes and I look forward to talking and working with you as
you adjust to your immortal-ship. Now, we need only wait for
Hiddukel, himself, to come online to put everything in order.
I am in contact with him and hopefully it will not be a very long
wait.
 
We thank you for your patience and I look forward to speaking
with you soon!

Text
Once again the sea around Palanthas is choppy, sending high waves
crashing against the wharf, even in the most sunny of days.  The Knighthood
had seen such a thing once before, and within hours of the sea becoming
tumultuous Knights began turning up dead in the streets.  Some of the locals
were saying that they saw two small forms exit the ocean each night, ghostly
making their way into the streets of the grand city of Palanthas.  Sailors
started refusing to leave the taverns and head out to sea, for they said the
Hearts of the Ocean had returned to decimate the enemies of Zeboim.

Text
Hey everyone :)

 If I might distract you all for a moment...  I'd like to nominate Olana
for a boost to 101.  She's been online very actively, has nearly 1200 hours
as of the posting of this note, and has an engaging character who is known
by many players.  I believe this has been handled on the forums in the past.
To avoid spamming everyone's note spool, if you can stop by and cast your
vote -- yay, nay, or indifferent -- the post will be in the immortal forums.
I think two weeks will be ample time to collect the votes.  

Thank you for your time!

Hey Reorx,
 
I talked to Hidd for a while tonight. We talked about how well you're
doing with building and, while we're both really glad that you're
enjoying learning about how everything works, he asked me to ask
for you to kinda take it easy on the MPROGs on the player port for now.
MPROGs aren't entirely bug-proof and they could potentially mess something
up if entered wrong. I know it's tough to wait for the builder port to
come back up, but it's the highest priority for Hidd to get running again.
The only reason I ask is the same reason we gave Soli to not play too much
with the reset command -- we have this port running, and we don't want
it to go offline, too!
 
I'll talk to you tomorrow, hopefully! I think I'll get a chance to log in
for a while at work. :)
 
Thank you!

Text
Hello Zeboim. I've eard what you sayd, i really did. If you see the log on my char you notice that i've done nothing since the time that you told me to ease up on the progs.
Like i was tying to explain, but you left, Paladine didn't force me or neither he sayd anything regarding the prog.
I show him Slash (my last one) and he loved that. Then he showed me his weapon, with the prog so the weapon would return to his room. That's what i did, i copy and paste it on my hammer.
I know i shouldn't have done it, and for that i'm sorry. I really am.
This is my fault and mine alone.
I'm trying to install the base MUD on my computer so i can try things there, without messing anything up in here, and for that i give you my word. I won't do anymore of this in the PP.
Once again, i'm sorry about this, i didn't want to hurt you (That's the last thing i want). I love talking to you, the pacience that you have with me, answering the questions, trying to explain things to me.
And once again, I'm really sorry about this.

Hey Reorx,
 
Thank you for your apology.
 
I've been stressed and upset these past couple of days.
My words were harsh, but it was difficult to see you continue editing, testing, and working on Slash's prog right after telling me that you understood my request.
However, I can see a possible disparity in my note to you -- where I phrased "ease off" of Progs as a kinder way of saying "please stop".
I should have, perhaps, clarified at that time, though I had far too many other things going on at work to spare the moment to do so.
Forgive me if this was the case, and I apologize for not speaking of it sooner.

 
I sincerely appreciate your efforts in attempting to get an instance of ROM running on your own computer. I am not sure if the last available ROM 2.4 will have MOBPrograms installed in it, but I really hope it does.

I may be absent until the weekend, taking care of some things. Work has been nightmarish, I have to plan for my wedding, and I just need to clear my head.

Good luck in your efforts, Pedro. Ultimately, I continue to be very proud and inspired by your progress.
 
We'll talk soon.

Hi to all. It was me. I was changing the ones that i have, but i NEVER tought that it will affect the ones on people. I changed the level, invis flag and ignoresize only. I know i've checked and saw that i was changing the ones that i carry, it seems that affected the ones on players. I've changed back, log my chars that have Gloves of Stealth on them, and everything is ok, without any change.
I though that when changing the ones on you, it would only affect the ones on you, cause the name is different, but i know, the vnum is the same.
Lesson learned.

It depends on what you do and how you do it.  Obviously, changing an
object's core stats in OEDIT would definitely have an impact.  Changing an
objects stats specifically by targeting the object by name, could
inadvertantly change someone else's object instead of yours if they happen
to be logged in at the same time as you and have the same object.  You
typically would need to specify the target by using a number and decimal
preceding the object name to make sure you're only modifying yours and not
someone elses.  Would need to see everything to specifically say what
exactly happened, but since the mistake was already corrected, probably no
point going forward.
