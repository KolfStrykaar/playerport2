gleams with moisture, in fact, reflecting the pale, eerie, green lights that
glow from the moss growing on the walls of the remains.  The moss grows
everywhere, of every different color and variety.  Deep green, golden
yellow, coral red; it climbs the walls and crawls across the domed ceiling.

The ruins at this spot stretch far above your head; almost impacting into
the domed ceiling far above.  There are a few once-been sailors, known to
the sea elves as KreeaQUEKHs (air-breathers), of many races walking down the
gloomy enclosed street.  These poor souls had been rescued by the sea elves
when their boats were destroyed by the giant maelstrom of the Blood Sea far
above.  Yet, taking another glance, they seem content with their new life
down here below the water away from the hassle of everyday life on land.

paradoxical in a way.  A few once-been sailors, of many races, are here

An eerie and pale green light surrounds the white-washed and intricately
carved columns that surround you at this spot.  Buildings are crumbling all
around, yet it seems that time will never let any of the ruins here change;
paradoxical in a way.  A few once-been sailors, of many races, are here
walking down these ominous ruins.

{WCenter of the Ruins of Istar{x~
The stone covered path here leads through the "center" of the ruins of
Istar.  Looking far up, the domed ceiling seems to reach its peak.  Thinking
on the subject, this spot might be close to where the fiery mountain struck
the Temple of the Kingpriest.  Everything here shimmers with moisture, in
fact, reflecting the pale, eerie, green lights that glow from the moss
growing on the walls of the remains.

This passage way is blocked by a large pile of fallen marble.  A few
drops of salt water seep through; leading one to believe there is a whole
boat-load of water behind those marble chunks.

The ruins at this spot stretch far above your head; almost impacting into
the domed ceiling far above.  There are a few once-been sailors, of many
races, walking down the dismal enclosed street here.  These poor souls had
been rescued by the sea elves when their boats were destroyed by the giant
maelstrom of the Blood Sea far above.  Yet, taking another glance, they seem
content with there new life down here below the water away from the hassle
of everyday life on land.

{WEdge of the Ruins{x~
The ruins seem to end here on this circular path along the ruined city of
Istar.  The domed ceiling, which protects the city from the hundreds of
gallons of water that lie on the other side, convenes on the rock floor
here.  Each stone in the wall is perfectly the same; each one tightly
fitting with the one next to it.  The air here is much saltier here, than
towards the center.

The gigantic wall before you gleams with moisture, in fact, reflecting
the pale, eerie, green lights that glow from the moss growing on the barrier
between a dry life and a watery death.  The moss grows everywhere, of every
different color and variety.  Deep green, golden yellow, coral red; it
climbs the walls and crawls across the domed ceiling.

The Broken Barrel serves the best salvaged ale in this city.  One has to
say salvaged, because all the goods that come into this city are from ships
that sink in the giant maelstrom far above.  The bar is not very large, but
large enough to hold a good number of people.  The ale and beer flows here,
as well does the tall tales and intoxication.  Although you can get more
than just ale and beer here, you can also get a bloody nose, if not careful.
Just remember, those not from here, are not always welcome.

{CThe Cleric's Guild{x~
This guild is the main area for a cleric to practice his or her healing
and combat skills.  Looking around, this place seems to be dedicated in the
name of Mishakal: the healing hand.  A master cleric stands in the room
ready to train those who are in need of some greater knowledge.

{CThe Bard Guild{x~
Instruments from all over Krynn hang off the walls while sheet music
litters the floor; as if snow and ash had fallen from the sky in this room. 
A soft hum of music wafts through the air here as some young bards try to
play their apparatuses of choice.  Once in a while, a student will mess up
and a sharp chord will pierce your heart like a dagger.

{CThe Spellfilcher Guild{X~
In this dark hole in the wall, there are a few students practicing magic
without any sort of guidance.  Knowledge, even imperfect or haphazard, of
magic is of great use in the art of thievery, and so many spellfilchers here
use their powers for personal gain.  This place doesn't look like it would
mind if you blew the wall away with some accidental spell.

{CThe Assassin Guild{x~
The room here is so dark that nothing can be seen except for a small
candle that lights up the southern corner of the room.  Though barely
visible, a man stands right next to you with a dagger to your side. 
Realizing you are not an intruder, he withdraws his dagger and offers you
his services on the art of assassinating.

{CEntrance to the Guilds of Sorcery{x~
Fellow initiates are reading and memorizing spells from their spell books
here in this study.  Some mages appear to be in deep meditation, with the
mere fabric of reality bending around them.  There are four supplementary
rooms which branch off from here.  The room to the east is where mages
specializing in the art of Illusion go to practice.  The room to the west is
where mages whom dabble in the art of Enchantment go to practice.  To the
north, the always feared Necromancers, go there to study and practice their
black art.  Finally, the conjurors go up the stairs from here to study their
arts of summoning.

{CGuild of the Necromancers{x~
The room itself is dimly lit by a single glowing torch, allowing the
brave soul who entered a slight glimpse into the death and decay that
surrounds this room.  Look farther in the darkness, corpses and other
grotesque, mutilated bodies in various states of decay can barely be seen
lining the walls.  The ramparts, ceiling, and floor are all made from cold,
black obsidian.

{CGuild of the Illusionists{X~
All the objects in the room here seem to change shape as you enter. 
Pulsating and floating, many arcane objects are scattered about the room as
well.  All of a sudden, a great and ghastly creature comes charging at you
and then disappears.  It's quite clear to even an initiate of magic that
this is the training room for the mages who focus on illusions.

{CGuild of the Enchanters{X~
Various spell components, stored in bottles, line the shelves of this
room.  On the far north side of the room, there is a large wooden bookcase
containing hundreds of books and scrolls.  Most of them are enclosed in
unadorned casings, but some are contained in silver, rune-covered cases.  It
becomes clear that this is the training room for Enchanters: mages that are
known to shift reality to alter the way existing creatures and objects exist
in this prime material plane.

summon their demons and monsters.  There is no ceiling here, allowing the
powerful conjuror the ability to summon gigantic monsters.  A large
pentagram with a six-pointed star in the center of it covers the entire
floor allowing this summoning to take place.

{CThe Battlemage Guild{x~
The room here is lined with potions and swords.  This is understandable
because battlemages are generally very disciplined warriors who have come to
understand that one must neglect neither the mind nor the body when
preparing for confrontation.  Thus, battlemages are quite formidable
warriors, and have taken to the study of magic.  The place here is quiet
enough for one to meditate and contemplate his or her own skills.

The large expansive hallway gives way to a large two-story room deep
inside the ruins.  Luminous, ornate torches, which line the room, shine on
the various battle-ready weapons that adorn the wall here.  Many seem to
have been well used.  Crown knights litter the place here, training their
skills for battle or just having fun performing mock duels.  A bunch of
practice dummies, festooned in the armor of the Knights of Takhisis, line
the south end of the room, waiting for use and abuse.

This old shop is filled with trinkets new and old.  The air here is

enchanting power emanating from them.

This courtyard type room separates the two main offices in Istar: the
Office of the Questmaster and the Office of Finance.  To the west, the
Office of the Questmaster is where a brave soul can go do some community
service for their hometown.  And to the east, the Office of Finance is where
one can handle all his or her own monetary issues.

This small office is adequate enough for the single man, the Questmaster

Down here, beneath the Blood Sea, it's dark; there is hardly enough light
to see what is down here with you.  There is a strong current here, pulling
the long kelp plants constantly; a result of the maelstrom far above.  In
the distance, one can see a couple of humanoid figures moving about; these
might be the sea elves that are rumored to be living in this sea.

this dark pit goes on down forever; as deep as the heart of evil itself.

This spot of the sea is much colder and darker than the surrounding sea
floor.  Maybe this is the start of the great watery pit, devoid of life,
where the fiery mountain struck the Temple of the Kingpriest.  The sea elves
are rumored to have said, even though they dare not venture into it, that
this dark pit goes on down forever; as deep as the heart of evil itself.

Down here, beneath the Blood Sea, it's dark; there is hardly enough light
to see what is down here with you.  There is a strong current here, pulling
the long kelp plants constantly; a result of the maelstrom far above.  In
the distance, one can see a couple of humanoid figures moving about; these
might be the sea elves that are rumored to be living in this sea.

are rumored to have said, even though they dare not venture into it, that
this dark pit goes on down forever; as deep as the heart of evil itself.

{BOn the Bottom of the Blood Sea{x~
Down here, beneath the Blood Sea, it's dark; there is hardly enough light
to see what is down here with you.  There is a strong current here, pulling
the long kelp plants constantly; a result of the maelstrom far above.  In
the distance, one can see a couple of humanoid figures moving about; these
might be the sea elves that are rumored to be living in this sea.

{CThe Songmaster's Apparatuses{X~
A soft purr of music mingles through the air, while instruments from all
over Krynn dangle from the ceiling here.  A large, black, and very expensive
grand piano stands in the middle of the room here, allowing the visitors a
chance to play some tunes.  Meanwhile, in the corner, some bards are here
playing there instruments of choice; this place seems to be the local spot
for bards to come together and play their merry, and sometimes sad,
melodies.

{WShrine of Red Magic{x~
This alcove is the private sanctuary of the resident mage, Zebulah.  A
cot lies against the far wall, and various personal belongings are strewn
about the area.  A large bookshelf containing various herbs and spellbooks
stands against the back wall, while the area opposite the cot contains a
modest shrine to Lunitari, goddess of Neutral Magic.  Having dedicated his
life to the order of the Red Robes, Zebulah often invites visiting mages to
share in her wisdom and hopefully devote themselves to her cause.
