sword.

The gate, into the city, can be seen just towards the south.  Dark
knights stand outside of the gate, checking all that enter and leave.  The
road here resembles that of a city street, for the path has been set with
cobbled stone.  The road is not the only sign of work in progress, for many
tree stumps can be seen in the surrounding fields.

later the street is full of broken furniture and angry guards as they

knights that patrol the streets.  The greed of keeping their way of life
unchanged, is the reason many citizens give for allowing the knights to
garrison the city.  These people have no love for the Solamnic knights and
see the power of these dark knights as a strong ally.  The street continues

When the dark knights first occupied this city, their base of operations
was set up here.  Now that Lord Tyrion has moved into his manor house, only
dispatch orders and subcommanders enter this building.  Many of the more
important messages are sent over to the manor house promptly.  Most of the
activity centers around the commanders of the patrols reporting in to go on

conquer the city, for it's citizens chose freely to join forces with these

For a city of average size, it is odd that so few citizens do not walk
around more freely.  It was by their choice that the dark knights entered
the city.  This agreement kept the people from watching their homes fall to
the torch and kept their heads upon their shoulders.  The people's greed for
power and hate for the Solamnics drove their choice.  The least they could
do is walk around, greet their new saviors, and praise Takhisis for these
fine works.

would love to know the size and strength of the garrison in this city.  From

make an expedition into the dwarven realms.

The cobbled street runs towards the north and east.  The homes here look
abandoned for many doors have been shattered, and no one is about.  It would
appear that not all the residents of Lemish openly welcomed the dark knights
into their fair city.  Those who did welcome these forces of darkness try
not to be too cheerful around the knights.  Any show of happiness causes the
patrol to be curious of that person's glee, and must find out what devious
plan that person must be planning.

owners, some being wealthy merchants while others were just greedy home

A tree's limbs have been all cut away save one.  This tree serves as the
gallows for people the dark knights deem as a threat.  A platform has been
built at the base of the tree.  The platform extends a few feet above the
ground and has two bags filled with sand hanging underneath.  Two ropes hang
from the limb, and are directly over the same spots where the bags hang
underneath.  A black ribbon is tied around what look like a handle near the
base of the tree.  The road of Sunset street continues towards the north

Sunset Street~
As the road continues to the north and south, one can see that many
wagons have rumbled down this road.  The road has two worn down places in
the stones where a countless number of heavy wagons have used this road. 
The dark knights that control this city are in constant need of supplies. 
The amount of food, clothing, weapons and armor is a staggering number to
most people.  For a simple garrison of troops, the inflow of supplies
amounts to surplus stockpiling for a distant army.

Sunset Street~
The road cuts through a vacant lot that only has an overgrown foundation
and pieces of trash.  By the size of the foundation, the structure that was
built here could of been quite a large building.  The foundation is some
fifty feet wide, sixty feet long and still has the hearth stones for two
fireplaces.  What the building looked like, how many stories tall it was, or
even how it was destroyed is unknown.

Intersection of Sunset Street and Trooper Ave~
The road of Sunset street runs towards the north and south, while Trooper
avenue continues towards the east and west.  The echo of a hammer striking
steel drifts from the west, while the sounds of hissing come from the east. 
The only armorer and weaponsmith allowed to work in the city have their
shops set up towards the west.  The dark knights that patrol this area are
mainly draconian with maybe a stray human or hobgoblin in the mix.

Sunset Street~
Towards the north and south runs Sunset street.  Just towards the south
Trooper avenue can be seen joining Sunset street.  This road way is quieter
than most other places in the city.  Not many patrols overlap their routes
in this section of the city.  Draconians that are in the ranks of the dark
knights also have a barracks in this section of the city.  They are fewer in
number but their presence still sends a shiver down the spine of most
citizens.

Sunset Street~
Here Sunset street opens up to the north and south.  Many of the homes
here are little more than huts and shacks.  The constant patrols from the
dark knights disrupt many efforts to repair these homes.  One home stands
out like a beacon among the other dingy buildings, for it is mainly royal
blue in color with it's trim work outlined in pink.  It had originally been
trimmed in red, but the owner soon changed his mind and tried the paint over
the red with white paint.  Since the white paint was much thinner it did not
completely cover the red.

piece of armor if they have saved up the pay they have received.  The shop

Topaz, the Armorer~
In a city controlled by a powerful army, an armorer must be able to meet
the needs of most any patron that enters his shop.  The honor of supplying
the dark knights is not one given lightly.  The shop is well stocked in many
types of armor that range from leather to banded mail.  A {Wforge{x stands
near the north wall, while a {yworkbench{x stands along the west wall.  The

The homes that dot this neighborhood belong to those who provide a
service for the dark knights.  Many of the apprentices that work at the
forges live in this area.  The knights show these specialists a sign of
respect by only harassing them once a month.  These cases of harassment
usually happen the day after they receive their pay.  Some have even been
able to delay the event by almost a full week.  When the knights found that
they had been tricked, the young apprentice wished he had never been born.

To the east Main street can be seen while this road continues towards the

With the city garrisoned such as it is, the patrols conducted by the dark
knights are aimed at locating and capturing Solamnic spies as well as to
keep the soldiers from becoming too bored.  An idle army would lose its
usefulness by drinking the taverns dry and darkening the streets with
needless bloodshed.

along this roadway.  Whatever the reason, it can honesty be said that this
street is indeed a beauty to behold.  Any source of light has a way of
reflecting off pieces of the landscape and bringing a delightful play of

Citizens walk along this roadway in either direction.  Some carry food
stuffs that they bought at the market, or even have slaves in tow carrying
their goods for them.  A dark knight of the Thorn is said to be able to cast
a spell over even the most resistant slave in order to claim them down. 
After such a spell is cast, the slave will do virtually anything to please
their new master.

Slave Way~

engineers designed some of the city's defenses.  To the {gnorth{x one can get a
drink a dark ale, and even place a bounty on someone you do not like at the
same time.  The road here continues towards the east and west as well.

Center Avenue~
You travel along the roadway that leads into the center of the city.  The
roadway also connects to Main street and Sunrise avenue.  Most who travel
this street do so to pay a visit to Lord Tyrion himself.  Most say that he
is a gentle, caring man, even though he is the commander of the garrison
that is based in Lemish.  Very few have actually seen Lord Tyrion and some
say he does not exist at all.

would normally be full of slaves.  Over wagons still contain their captives
begging to be set free, while other slave look on as if in a daze.  Many of
the wagon drivers lounge about, drinking to the fortunes they have earned
today and how much more they will get tomorrow.

Workers form the slave market busy themselves with the cleaning of the
slave wagons.  The horses that pull these wagons are unhitched and led off
to the side where they are watered, feed, and given a good rub down.  The

lightly unless you would like to be sold as a slave as well.

at the foot of one of the bodies, crying and cursing all those involved. 
One of the knights was wounded, while the others look about all the death
and carnage.  Among the dead is a kender with a money pouch clung to his
tiny hand, and has a shocked look on his face.

the streets.  It has not been unheard of to see a full company of armored
knight sent in to contain the hobgoblin's fun.  If the trouble makers
outnumber the drunken hobgoblins, then a commander may hold back his troops
until the hobgoblins earn their monthly pay for a change.

towers stand on either side of the manor, one east and one west, with
banners flapping in the sky.  The stone work is mostly a red brick, with
white stone used for the trim work.  The commanders of the dark knights
usually meet in this manor once a week.  After the meeting has occurred, a
grand feast is usually held, followed by a ball.

Since Lord Tyrion moved into his manor, very few inspections are ever done.

visitors.  Another visitor appears to be a woman of great importance, for
she is dressed in polished armor and has two guards standing behind her. 
For those who find sitting to be too boring will find a library open to
them.  The open doorway to the east is of most interest, for a grand stair

fixing of small meal.  This kitchen is fully staffed with three cooks and
many hand servants.  This kitchen does not just serve a breakfast, lunch, or
dinner but it also must have food prepared for unexpected dinner guests. 
Lord Tyrion is known to call for a great feast at the drop of a hat, that
sends the staff on mad dash to comply to the Lord's whims.  A servant hefts
a bucket filled with steaming water before leaving through the doorway
towards the west.  Another servant arrives from a set of stairs carrying a

to the next floor.  A small well lit hallway leads off towards the east and
west.  A stained {Cglass{x window stands at the top of the landing encased with
shimmering gold.  Two brass lanterns are mounted onto the wall to either
side of the landing clearly lighting the steps.

north glass stain window~
Encased in shimmering gold, a window made of stain glass stands large as
life itself.  The figure of a Knight of Takhisis holding forth a gleaming
sword is depicted.  The figure has a foot on top of a fallen enemy, and a
five headed dragon hovers overhead.

A Smaller Hallway~
This smaller hallway is barely large enough for three people to fit
through.  An open doorway stands towards the west and the hallway continues
towards the south.  The walls are split into a lower and upper panel, with
hand carved cherry oak along the bottom and rose red marble above that. 
These walls would be a welcoming sight for a guest to see, either when
waking to a new morning or going to a warm bed.

a cloak or coat of some sort hanging from them.  Muddy foot prints can be
seen leading from the door to an open doorway towards the south.  Bits of

The floor is covered with rugs made from the hides of bears slain by Lord
Tyrion himself.  A door with golden hinges stands towards the east.

and must work hard for what they have.  Their Lord is tyrant to all but the
nobles that eat at his tables and petition for his favor.  These walls have

bed is unkempt and it's covers are in disarray.  A woman lies sprawled out
amongst the bed covers asleep and rather unclothed.  A suit of battle armor
sits on a rack that stands in the corner.  Many weapons hang from wooden
pegs that are mounted on the wall.  An oak door stands to the north.

people stand in line to purchase a pass to enter the market.  One noble's
argument with the ticket salesman is so loud and draws so much attention,
that an army of stomping dwarves could sneak in.  Several knights stand
dressed in ceremonial armor, cannot help but roll their eyes because of the
misery of some the city's filthy rich.

buyers.  The few guards that are on hand are only there to ensure the slaves
do not get rowdy and try anything foolish.  Some of the slaves broke the
laws of the dark knights and will pay the price for it.  Most of the buyers
are those with wealth or just enough money to make someone else live in
shame.

the items range from nailing spikes, to cut timber, and even the wagons and
carts to move them.  Citizens are allowed to come here and add to the

them.

A couple of grave diggers are walking from the south with a shovel and pick
over their shoulders.  One is carrying a lantern while the other carries his
lunch in a pail.  Their work does not seem to dampen their spirit in this
place.  One tells the other a bawdy tale about two women and a drunk priest.

Not all the sections of this graveyard bring a peace to ones spirit. 
Instead they send an uncontrollable shiver up your spine, for the place
fills you with dread.  The grasses look to have been burned away here, and
only the wildest weeds are able to grow in the parched earth.  Among these
weeds are creeping vines with many sharp thorns that will draw blood at the
slightest touch.

Graveyard~
For some who could not afford a marker, other items were used instead.  A
sword with its blade thrust into the ground and a rusting helm perched on
top of it serves as a marker for one such grave.  A sky blue ribbon, now
tattered for the winds and weather, has been tied to the hilt.  The sword is
plain looking, but is in far better condition than the helm for the only
rust upon it comes from the helmet itself.

that they now live in was built by their hand.  Depending on the resources

draconians are by far more efficient and organized than the human dark

This building was once dedicated to the blue clerics of Mishakal but now
has become a Temple to the goddess Takhisis.  With the garrisoning of
the dark knights, this was just one of the many things that were changed. 
This temple is rather peaceful in a dark, spooky sort of way.  Most of the
decor is in shades of black with streaks of red, white, green and blue that
add to the displays of her ever lasting works and evil.

This place looks more like a run down bar rather than a bounty office. 
The room has a couple of tables that look like they have been broken and
patched together again many times.  There are no chairs but hard stone
benches stand scattered about the room.  Neither table has a complete set of
matching legs, for each looks to be the lone survivor of some long age
destroyed table.
