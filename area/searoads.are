{BBlue Water{x~
A few lone waves wash in from a distant place making the water a bit more
rough and hard to maneuver.  Where this water pathway leads is still unclear
due to the openness of the water.  A few schools of fish swim a few feet
below, but beyond that not even the most gifted could tell what lies beyond.
Just ahead a massive shipwreck appears to have happened, the litter is in
vast amounts, and a few barrels can be seen floating on the surface.

A massive tree floats in the water.  An usual place this far out, for a
tree to be, though upon further inspection it seems to have been at sea for
quite awhile.  A few barnacle and oysters have clung to it, giving them a
roaming home.  Floating close by is a massive dead fish.  It's long snout
and pointed tail depicts it to be a swordfish.  Though from the color on it,
it seems to have come from very deep water.

A few kelp leaves float on the surface, while a small school of fish play
just under the water.  Their shiny scales reflecting what light there is,
and sending the water into a blinding glimmer a light.  A few dead tigs
litter the water, while a water spider walks on the surface, immune to what
the water can do.

The water around here is a deep blue color and covers a vast area.  A few
small schools of fish swim just under the surface, giving the area in which
they are a shimmering affect.  A few small ripples break the surface as a
larger fish try to follow the quickly moving schools.  Some debris also
floats on the surface, appearing to be remnants of a shipwreck.

A soft mist hovers just over the water, giving this part an eerie look. 
The shear vastness of what appears to be a pathway in the water, is hard to
distinguish.  The mist covers a large area, hiding just how long or curving
this pathway could be.  A few bits of wood float along in the current making
one think of what happened to the last person who followed this path.

A large abandoned boat floats here.  The air has done it's damage and now
the boat creaks and takes in small amounts of water from time to time.  A
few barnicles have made their home on the bottom of the boat, clinging to
the rotted wood.  From time to time large sharks circle the boat, only to
lose interest, when a bump from them knocks nothing out.  A sad sight to see
in the middle of nowhere.

A massive tree floats in the water.  An usual place this far out, for a
tree to be, though upon further inspection it seems to have been at sea for
quite awhile.  A few barnacle and oysters have clung to it, giving them a
roaming home.  Floating close by is a massive dead fish.  It's long snout
and pointed tail depicts it to be a swordfish.  Though from the color on it,
it seems to have come from very deep water.

The water around here is a deep blue color and covers a vast area.  A few
small schools of fish swim just under the surface, giving the area in which
they are a shimmering affect.  A few small ripples break the surface as a
larger fish try to follow the quickly moving schools.  Some debris also
floats on the surface, appearing to be remnants of a shipwreck.

An eerie silence seems to haunt the water.  Nothing is stirring, no fish
can be seen, and nothing in the sand seems to be moving.  All of a sudden a
dolphin whizzes past and many clicks and whistles can be heard.  Large
schools of fish congregate by the coral and anemones to have their feed.

The glittering path of crushed shells and dark pebbles lead the way into
an unknown.  Many small fish school just along side of the path, playing
some game between them.  A large shadow crosses the path...  Overhead a
manta ray glides through the water like a waterfall falls to the pool below.

the current, they take on a life of their own.  A strange clicking noise can
be heard somewhere off in the distance.  The ground shakes slightly...  An

{BUnderwater Path{x~
A small fish swims quickly by, making little bubbles with its tail.  As
the bubbles slowly start to rise, and larger fish vaults past, obviously
going after its prey.  A few broken leaves of kelp slowly float by on the
current, while the debris holds still at its position.

{BUnderwater Path{x~
The water is cool and dark, while a few schools of fish swim their way
around.  A few chuncks of floating debris litter the water, allowing a small
pathway to be seen, for those who look for it.  The suns rays do not reach,
not even here, so having your own light might be a good thing.

A few loud squeals can be heard.  A school of whales swim by, minding
their own buisness, not caring what the rest of the sea is up too.  The
debris from the surface vary in size and shape, and oddly do not move around
as one would think they should.  It's almost as if they are held in place by
an invisible chain.

A small whirlpool sucks any living thing down just under the water. 
Below lies a vast nothingness of water and endless dark.  A few beams of
sunlight break through the waters surface showing the dark way down.

A few lone waves wash in from a distant place making the water a bit more

due to the openness of the water.  A few schools of fish swim a few feet

A soft mist hovers just over the water, giving this part an eerie look. 
The shear vastness of what appears to be a pathway in the water, is hard to
distinguish.  The mist covers a large area, hiding just how long or curving
this pathway could be.  A few bits of wood float along in the current making
one think of what happened to the last person who followed this path.

A few lone waves wash in from a distant place making the water a bit more
rough and hard to maneuver.  Where this water pathway leads is still unclear
due to the openness of the water.  A few schools of fish swim a few feet
below, but beyond that not even the most gifted could tell what lies beyond.
Just ahead a massive shipwreck appears to have happened, the litter is in
vast amounts, and a few barrels can be seen floating on the surface.

A massive tree floats in the water.  An usual place this far out, for a
tree to be, though upon further inspection it seems to have been at sea for
quite awhile.  A few barnacle and oysters have clung to it, giving them a
roaming home.  Floating close by is a massive dead fish.  It's long snout
and pointed tail depicts it to be a swordfish.  Though from the color on it,
it seems to have come from very deep water.
