Gateway of Qualinost~
Graceful silver arches line the entryway to the city, circling to the
east and west to form a great wall of sorts.  Archers and stout elven
warriors patrol the arches, which end in the great spires at each of the
four corners of the city.  The road into Qualinost continues to the north,
where small houses and businesses line each side.  In the far north lies the
Tower of the Sun, golden and elegant as it sits on the highest hill in the
city.  To the south, an arched bridge empties onto a small road leading
deeper into the forests of Qualinesti.

Intersection of Speaker's Way and Sylvan Avenue~
Paved avenues lie in all directions.  Speaker's Way meanders to the north
amidst the quartzstone houses, before eventually arriving at the Hall of the
Sky.  To the east and west, Sylvan Avenue branches deeper into the city. 
The winds sweep by, bearing the smell of sap and the sweet aroma of fresh
blossoms.  The trees stretch out their branches on either side of the road,
beckoning the weary traveller to stop and rest beneath their flowered
embrace.  A group of elven archers walk the silvery arches to the south
their keen eyes searching the forest for any danger.  The grand gate lies to
the south, its large silver surface bearing the symbols of the aspen leaf
cast across a gleaming sun.

Sylvan Avenue~
The avenue winds to the east through this residential area.  Quartz and
aspen houses abound here.  To the south, the footsteps of the guards are
barely audible over the whistle of the wind.  To the north, the Tower of the
Sun stands against the horizon; a golden spire reaching toward the heavens,
its light rivaling that of its namesake.  A small caravan of travellers
enters the city through the gate to the west, their destination being the
Grand Market of Qualinost.  The road turns in the distance to the east,
opening into a large plaza.

To the east the avenue spills out into the Southeastern plaza, a small
square meant to house the trading caravans upon their arrival.  Birds fly
above, their wings beating a rhythm to the whispering leaves.  To the west
the road stretches into the distance; the silver spires of the wall bearing
the flags of the Qualinesti nation visible against the sky.  The flags beat
against the wind, flying above the gates of the city.  Sparkling in the
distance to the north stands the Tower of the Sun, home to the Speaker of
the Sun, ruler of Qualinost.

pass straight through without paying much attention to their wild cousins. 
A few Kagonesti hunters skin their recent kills, whilst others are cooking
the meat and selling both the meat and the furs to travellers.  To the east
and to the north lie cleaner sections of the plaza.

intricate colored tiles, each polished to perfection.  A few wooden stands
have been erected here, from which wares are sold and at one stands a young
Qualinesti guard.  The guard has application papers for those wishing to
join the local Qualinesti militia to defend the city.  His stand receives
the occasional visit from proud Qualinesti youths.  To the west a street
leads off towards the gates of Qualinost.

Southeastern Plaza~
The grand southeastern plaza begins here, feeding off to the east and
south.  Stalls can be seen in both directions, where merchants are selling
their wares and elves are mingling about for gossip on the elven court.  The
street continues north toward the Hall of the Sky.  Houses of quartz stand
just outside the plaza, their wondrous architecture emanating elven grace. 
Above, birds call out in song gliding about upon the unseen winds over the
grand elven city.

Fruit stands line one area of the plaza, whilst on the other a small
stage is set up for performing artists and musicians.  Presently a young elf
bard plays upon his flute, a soothing melody to ease the minds of both
vendors and shoppers alike.  Elves mill about the stage, many maidens
watching the handsome musician adoringly.  The plaza continues to both the
east and the west.

The tiled plaza floor continues in the ivy pattern, a plethora of green
hues set into it's massive surface.  To the northwest, the Tower of the Sun
stands tall, radiating light as if in competition with the natural lights
brought to Krynn by the celestial bodies.  To the west, the plaza continues
and heads further into the capital city of Qualinost, meandering its way
towards the center of the city to the Hall of the Sky.  Way towards the
center of the city to the Hall of the Sky.

In this section of the plaza, courtiers try to amuse elven maidens,
whilst acrobats try to earn a living by performing agile feats.  The plaza
is alive with life and joy, with grandiose colored tiles at the feet of
those present twisting into a curl of ivy the color of fine jade.  East and
southward the plaza stretches on, giving way to more frivolity as the guards
watch from the eastern wall.

discuss the latest fashions in the elven court, or rumors of what the
foolish humans are doing outside of their city.  To the north, a road known
simply as Mantis Way exits the plaza, the colorful tiles along the ground
now shifting into inscriptions dedicated to the god Mantis of the Rose,
known as Majere to humans.

Colored tiles run along the north-eastern section of the plaza, blending
into the silver arches to the east.  Above, the guards of Qualinost patrol
the arches, their eyes distracted by the elven maidens who frolic in this
area.  Light laughter dances from their lips as the maidens tease elven
youths.  The faint scents of the forest drift in on an easy breeze, offering
a cool balm to any wearied traveller.  Exits from this area of the plaza lie

watchmen of the city, their eyes cast into the forest searching for
intruders.  Golden yellow tiles form into what could only be the rays of the
great sun that decorates the center of the plaza, their brilliant hues
matching the lovely gowns and clothes of the elves milling about.  The
latest gossip dances on their lips as the Qualinesti nobles peruse items at
the stalls.  The plaza continues to the north and south, following the

to defend the tower.  Otherwise it is relatively bare, with a quartz
staircase leading upwards.  Qualinesti and Kagonesti guards stand at

coming out of their guard tower to the east.  The guards keep the general
populace clear of their tower and immediate area, so they can focus on the
defense of the city.  To the north and west lies the more clustered sections

shaded Astra's Lane, a large plaza can be seen stretching into the distance;
teeming with people gathered across the vast expanse of stone and tile.  To
the east stands an elegant silver gate, allowing access into a large garden
filled with various flowers and fountains; a strange sight compared to its
sister path to the west.  Mantis Way continues on to the south, a few
clerics in robes of red and copper making their way to meditate at the grove

A stocky elven man stands at the anvil, sparks flying as he prepares a new
batch of shoes for the animals within.  A few elven youths mill around the
front of the forge, hoping to earn a few steel as runners and errand boys
for the stablemaster.  To the north, a small building houses the
stablemaster's office; while to the east, the once elegant plaza overflows

Benches made from the aspen trees of the forests line the edge of the
plaza, so that discussion and discourse can take place in this harmonious

large trees growing at its side.  Another small pathway offers passage
through the plaza to the west and to the south, where another road breaks
off heading eastward towards the city gates.

persistance and by being one of the best warriors in the city.  He gives

with wings outstretched.  To the northwest the Tower of the Sun rises above
the city, glowing with a golden aura.

upon wet moss, as it scampers upwards into the protective boughs of a large
tree.  Fruit of various colors hangs from branches along slender branches,
their slim arms wielding large, green leaves that clash with the bright hues
of both fruit and blossom.  Birds chitter about, their small voices barely
audible, as if they wish to leave the grove to it's sense of solemn quiet. 
To the west, the southrn wall of trees that stand about the grove, opens
into a road that heads into the city of Qualinost, but the grove itself
continues on to the west.  Northwards a large stone archway justs from the
ground, a strange structure within the grove, but beyond it can be seen the
domed roof of a divine temple.

green leaves.  A few people walk about here, many walking along a small path
that leads the weary towards the temple.  Fruit hangs delicately along the
many branches, their sweet scents filling the air, and few lay fallen about
the grassy floor, scattered about mounds of silken moss.  Whispers from two
elven lovers, resting within a copse of trees, breaks the seemingly strange
silence of the grove, as they make vows of eternal devotion to one another,
and kiss.  The grove continues in all directions, and open to the south into
a road leading into the city.

leaves whisper overhead, stirred to life by a light wind they dance into a
rustling life.  A pool skirts large trees to the east, it's waters clear and
crystalline, lilies float peacefully acorss it's surface, their white
flowers opening towards the green canopy above.  People wander from the rest

Light dances in from the north, entering through the gap cut into the
grove's natural barrier to allow passage upon the grand, tiled road. 
Crafted into the surface of the road are golden representations of the sun,
and in the distance the Tower of the Sun can be seen glistening against the
horizon, it's many spires piercing the heavens with a golden light.  Small
pathways meander throughout the grove, each leading to secluded places,
sought out by the elves for brief moments of solace from everyday life.  To
the east a path leads out of the grove through a large, stone archway set
before a massive stone building with a domed roof.  Southwards a trail leads
once more out of the grove into the southern parts of the city, where people
can be seen milling about in the massive plaza known as the Hall of the Sky.
A shinging light glimmers off the surface of a pool to the west, rays
dancing along the trunks of ancient trees.

A small pool shimmers in light that escapes the emerald grasp of the
canopy above, and the light spreads across the clearing illuminating the
green darkness crafted by the looming trees.  A fawn enters the grove,
uncaring of the people that wander about in the embrace of a realm dedicated
to nature, and dips it's head low to sip at the tranquil waters of the pool.
It's ears perk up, listening alertly, and once more it returns to the deeper
recesses of the grove, hidden away by the large trees.  To the west, light
shines in from the north, making way through the entrance set into the grove
that allows passage out into the northern parts of the city.  A green
darkness envelopes the grove to the south, as light shines through the
canopy above, casting a green shade upon the woodland and the forest floor.

smaller unseen animals.  Large pieces of fruit hang upon the slender but
gnarled branches overhead.  To the north the grove opens into a large
clearing, where the reflected light shimmering across a pool, dance across
the slender trunks of the trees with an eerie light.  Eastwards, the grove
opens to the south where it the trees have been mended to allow passage upon
a tiled road, bound for the southern parts of the elven city.  Birds call

about them with keen onyx-colored eyes.

swaying leaves of glistening emarldine greens.  At the center of the
courtyard is a pool, reflecting light about the garden, sending dancing
shimmer towards the temple entrance to the east.  Just past the pool sit a
group of clerics clad in green robes, they chant prayers as they rest in a
serene meditation.  Well-kept beds of blue flowers grow along multiple
pathways that wind about the courtyard, their blue faces turned northwards,
towards the Tower of the Sun.  People mingle about, enjoying the peace that
seems to grow here, unhindered by the despair elsewhere in Krynn.  To the
east stands the Temple of Branchala, a large domed building rising into the
sky.  A gate to the south opens into the grove of Qualinost, and beyond the
elven city.

The Temple Alcove~
Various wooden plaques hang upon the walls, each bearing the symbols of
the Holy Gods of Light.  Above a large doorway to the east hangs an
exquisite mural of Branchala, keeper of this temple.  People stand about,
looking eastwards into the temple proper, the sounds of light music and
prayers falling upon their ears.  A few of the elven patrons glance
nervously at a small gathering of humans sitting against the wall, each
bearing recent scars and wounds.  To the west stands another large arch
opening out in a vast garden, known as the Courtyard of the Bard, a holy
garden dedicated to Branchala and his followers.  Adorning the archs to the
east and west are fabrics of elegent greens and yellows, swaying softly in
an unhindered breeze from outside.

The Temple of Branchala~
Tapestries dangle down from the large dome ceiling, crafted by
commissioned dwarven hands shortly after the rediscovery of the gods. 
Enlivened by a breeze they sway slightly, the gust seeming to animate woven
illustrations of the hardships of the Qualinesti through time.  A single
cleric stands before and altar, whispering divine prayers to the god of the
elves, Branchala.  Tha alter is of a pure white stone, bearing the symbol of
a golden harp, adorned by green leaves of pristine ivy.  Music sings out
from a group of ministrels sitting by the large silver doors to the west,
where the alcove of the temple stands.  The arch above the door is festooned
with cloths of emerald green, and embroidered with the symbols of Branchala
in a fine golden silk.

The Walk of Nobles~
Trees stand along the street, standing over the tiled road, their large
branches draping the colorful designs built into it's surface with dancing
shadows, born from the winds.  Other pathways split from the road, and head
off into the trees, winding through vast gardens, each filled with colorful
flowers, the pathways ending at the grand doors of large rose-quartz houses.
Flags wave from the pink spires of the houses, each denoting the dwellings
as a house of elven nobility.  A servant girl rushes by, a bag in her hands,
and taking a side path she runs up to one of the houses and enters.  To the
south, the bustling sounds of the market prevent any ominous silence, the
air loud with the calls of vendors searching for patrons.  The street
stretches out to the north as well, meandering through the Walk of the
Nobles.

Avenue of Guilds~
The street continues onwards to the west and the east, alive with the
activities of people as they walk between the large building on either side,
festooned with the banners of the many guilds belonging to the vast elven
city.  To the northeast stands the imposing Tower of the Sun, it's ominous
figure overlooking the city as it pierces the sky with a golden light.  Just
to the north, a large stone buildin bears the banners of the Bards, a sword
intertwined amongst the strings of a silver harp.  Voices raised in song
echo out of the building, as individuals inside practice their skills.  To
the south, another similar building stands, the banners of the Clerics
waving atop the building's domed roof, picturing a staff crossed atop a blue
infinity symbol.  More buildings line the road in both directions, to the
east and the west.

The Walk of Nobles~
The street continues onward, large houses visible amongst a green sea of
trees, their branches moving slightly as they dance within the sweeping
breeze.  Birds circle above, their chitters barely audible as it clashes
with the din of yelling voices to the south, the bustle of the market
drowning most other sounds.  To the northeast, a grand golden spire peeks
from above the tree, a massive tower of golden light standing amongst the
heavens, it watches over the city with a benevolent glow.  A few elves, each
dressed in robes of fine silk, walk along the road, caught in conversations
of past dinners at the Speaker's Palace, and glancing to the south they gaze
along pillars of smoke visible upon the southern horizon, and whisper of
their human 'scar' within the city.  To the south, a the marketdistrict
bustles with activity, and to the north the road winds about the houses of
the nobles.

Walk of the Nobles~
A small pathway turns to the east here, heading into a shadowed alley of
trees, the looming trunks resembling walls, and beyond another street can be
seen circling the sacred grove of the Qualinesti.  The road is decorated in
tiles of glorious hues, each a bright color woven into intricate designs
dedicated to the gods of Krynn, a platinum dragon faces a swirling
multi-headed darkness.  Voices can be heard from a clearing to the east, as
a family sits down for a meal, their laughter audible from the streets.  To
the south, calls of merchants selling their wares within the large elven
marketplace of Qualinost.  The road continues on to the south, closing the
distance to the market, and to the north, where it turns to the west heading
deeper into the city.

A Tree Shadowed Alley~
Trees line this shadowed lane, as it stretches from the east to the west,
connecting the Walk of the Nobles with Quithesalas Street.  Large boughs
hang low, casting dancing shades of greens along the silent tiles of the
street, a few leaves fall to the ground and rustle lightly as they sweep
across the road.  Barely visible behind the trees can be seen large
rose-quartz dwellings, standing amongst shadowed copses of trees within the
intricate mazes of lavish gardens.  Water drips from above, slowly cascading
down from the branches left by a recently passed storm, the drops shattering
the silence of the road with loud plops into a shimmering puddle dancing in
the light that escapes the leafen embrace above.  Birds glide overhead,
turning southwards towards the marketplace.

Quithesalas Street -- West~
The road continues to the north and the south, skirting about the vast
grove of trees to the east.  Breaking above the canopy rises a stone dome,
which houses the Temple of Branchala from the ravages of weather.  To the
west lies a shadowed alley, breaking between the trees and turning towards
the Walk of Nobles in the distance.  Far to the north stands the ominous
Tower of the Sun, it's towering form rising above the rest of the city, as
it basks in a golden light.  Birds cry out as they fly overhead, their
voices raising upon the winds and sweeping away out into the city.  A few
elves walk about, their voices raised as they speak of current happenings
about Anasalon, making harsh whispers of 'human wars' and 'human follies'. 
To the south Quithesalas street intersects with Lualitaryn Boulevard, and in
the distance to the north the road turns eastwards circling the grove.

gardens surrounding them, banners waving atop their spires denoting the
noble family of their ownership.  Circling the grove, Quithesalas street
continues onward to the north, and to the south it intersects with
Lualitaryn Boulevard, turning to the east and the west.  Standing upon the
northern horizon is the Tower of the Sun, visible from most anywhere in the
elven city.  Birds call out, their wings allowing them to glide over head as
they dart into the recesses of the grove, their songs fading as they enter

place audible in the distance to the south as merchants seek out buyers for
their eccentric wares and services.  Birds fly about, their wings beating
soflty among the tall trees, visible as they fly in between the emerald clad
branches seeking out something to satisy their impish curiosity.  To the
northeast, standing above Qualinost watches the Tower of the Sun, the sacred
golden spire of the Qualinesti.  It casts a warm glow out into the sky above

play, enjoying the near immortality of elven youth.  To the south the
marketplace can be seen, large silken banners waving in the wind marking the
merchants and their available wares, as their calls ring out in the
distance, and beyond a few columns of smoke rise into the sky, delicate
black snakes twisting upon the horizon as they rise into the heavens above. 
A young girl runs by, heeding the call of her mother, her honey-blonde hair
waving in the wind as if she too were a miracle of the nature surrounding
the city.  Upon the northeastern horizon stands the imposing Tower of the
Sun, a golden sentinel standing above the city of elves.

The Walk of Nobles~
The road takes a slight turn here, curving about a small garden filled
with violet flowers, their faces turned upwards as they seek open sky to
bask in any sunlight that escapes the leafen grasp of the numerous trees. 
As it heads north, the road passes many houses, each crafted from the
delicate pink stone, known as rose quartz, colorful banners waving atop
branch-like spires, denoting them as the noble houses of the elves.  To the
south, the road takes another slight turn to the west, and heads deeper into
the elven city, winding amogst the trees and buildings like a stone serpent.
Above the city comes the cry of birds, their small forms barely visible as

The Walk of Nobles~
The well-paved road wanders through the groves and dwellings of the
nobles of Qualinost.  Their rose-quartz homes can be seen through the trees
on either side of the road, the domed buildings of rose-quartz rising into
the treetops like pink jewels in a vast see of green.  Elven men and women
walk along the road, a few turning into the groves laid out before their
homes, each decorated with fantastics gardens of blooming flowers and
plants.  Rising above the city in the distance, the Tower of the Sun can be
seen, its golden spires glistening beneath the heavens as it casts a glow
down upon Qualinost.

of the small jewelry store to the north.  Elven guards, each clad in leather
armors bearing the symbol of the sun, approach and turn eastward into a

south where it ventures off into the city proper.  In the distance to the
south, once can hear the cries of merchants and peddlers seeking to fatten
their purses.  The trees are ancients, and their branches hang low above the
road, creating a canopy of green leaves, with light from above occaisionally
breaking through the emerald grasp.  Above birds flit about, curiosity
causing them to dart in and out of the branches as they seek their homes.  A
few elven women stand aside the paved road, their voices hushed and
whispering, and looking about they scramble back to the gardens before
anyone notices their absence from their duties.

and east.  To the north stands a large stone building, atop it's domed roof
waves a banner bearing the symbols of the Battlemage guild, and axe crossed
atop a spellbook.  Southwards stands a similar building, banner waving atop
it's roof as well, these marked with the symbols of the warriors, and axe
atop a worn shield.  A group of men, stand just outside the entrance to the
south, weapons slung across their backs, and mismatched armor strapped to
their bodies, glancing about they turn into their guildhall to continue
their training.  To the northeast stands the Tower of the Sun, it's
glistening spires reaching upwards into the heavens above the elven city.

Avenue of Guilds~
Silks of green festoon the tree branches hanging over this section og the
Avenue of Guilds, the symbol of Chislev woven into the rich fabrics.  An
elven child screams in delight as a man exits the building to the north, a
bear following closely behind him.  Above the doorway of the domed building
hangs the symbol for the Ranger's Guildhall, depicting a shield set before a
thriving vallenwood tree.  To the south, a similar building offers its
resources to those wishing to seek the skills of the druidic arts, a symbol
depicting a hand upon a vibrant leaf.  Chanting can be heard from within the
Druid Guildhall, and merges with the calls of the birds as they glide
through the treetops.  To both the west and the east, stretches the Avenue
of Guilds, other Guildhalls visible within the trees.  To the north, the
Tower of the Sun stands wtach over the city of Qualinost, a warm light
pulsing out from the golden tower.

The Walk of Nobles~
The Walk of Nobles extends to the west and the east, dwellings of
rose-quartz rising up upon either side, their polished walls shimmering
amongst the leafen grasp of the groves they occupy.  Elves clad in rich
clothes of vibrant colors walk along, their voices lost in coversation as
they speculate the current affairs of the city.  Upon the winds, small birds
dance and sing, their melodic chirping gliding with them upon the breeze as
they seek refuge within the branches of a youthful vallenwood, the leaves
shaking a bit as they land.  Upon the northwestern horizon, the Tower of the

Lord Tyresian's Elven Blades and Bows~
Elegant silver swords are mounted into the rose-quartz walls, each
delicately hanging by cords attached to their sheaths.  The light, from the
lanterns hanging above from the pinkinsh ceiling of the store, slides across
the wares, gracing the fine crafted blades of swords and daggers.  Upon the
southern wall hang many bows, each nearly unique in its form and crafted
from different woods coveted by the elves.  Colored feathers jut from the
shafts of arrows, standing in the many quivers that sit beneath the favored
weapons of the elven race.  To the east, stands a large wooden door; a blade
crossed over a bow carved into the oaken surface.  A few young elven men
enter, their eyes wandering over the merchandise; the street behind them
filled with the cries of merchants seeking similar patrons for various other
wares within the city.

Bottles and vials, each adorned with a small white label and a spidery
writing in silver elven script, sit about upon the many shelves of the room.
A myriad of scents fills the air, creating an eerie smell of the various
concoctions mingling about the large store.  A soft glow emits from the
rose-quartz walls, giving the room a dim light that keeps the looming
shadows at bay.  Trylias, looks over her wares, and turns to stir a large
cauldron sitting upon the wall to the east, hanging precariously within the
intricately carved fireplace.  She whispers a few words, and turns back,
looking to the door as a few people enter their eyes bearing a deep sense of
fear as they enter the mysterious store.  To the west a large door opens
outwards into the streets of Qualinost, a simple symbol adorning the oaken
surface, of three moons sloly joining into one.

watching the door, as elven patrons enter, and licking his lips he lets his
eyes shift to their purses in a silent delight.  A large window is set into
the eastern wall, baskets of elven fruits set about for view by those
passing by the store outside upon the busy streets of Qualinost.  Lanterns,
each bearing dancing flames, send shadows swirling about the room and a
plethora of aromas assails the air, as a breeze enters through the door,
opening at the entrance of a few elves from the street beyond.  A few elven
children gaze at various displays of elven sweet breads upon a counter set
into the northern wall, their eyes wide with awe, each hypnotized by the
promise of the elven delicacy.

triumphant song as deft hands swiflty glide across the lyre at her
fingertips.  A few elves sit about, their eyes cast upon the bardess, as
they put elven goblets to their mouths and sip sweet smelling wine.  A young
elven man stands behind a large counter set into the wall to the east, an
apron set about his waist, he cleans a few glasses, and looking out over the
room and surveys his patrons, seeking those in need of more drink.  Large
tapestries hang down from the walls, hiding the wooden surfaces behind
elegent cloths picturing the forest of Qualinesti, so intricately woven they
are often mistaken as windows into the surrounding gardens outside.  To the
west a door opens into the gardens beyond, the soft songs of birds minlging
with the woman's voice.

to the banker for his next task.  The banker himself is an aging elf in

stands behind a counter, using his large fists to beat a mound of dough.

Well-crafted pices of armor sit about on display, the light from lanterns
dancing along the intricate silver craftings of armor.  The light shimmers
along the sigils of the elves, inscribed into the armors with a delicate
hand.  Lystralieas, polishes the surface of a glorious platinum shield, and
satisfied hangs it upon the wall where it gleams like the tranquil surface
of a mirror.  Built into a southern wall is a window of colored blue glass,
and people can be seen strolling about the streets beyond, a few stopping to
enter a large oaken door marked with a breastplate and a hammer.  Set out
upon the western hall, hang various pieces of the leather armors favored by
the elves, adhering to their wishes of quick movements and stealth. 
Littered about the floor are other pieces of metal armors, purchased from
the travelling caravans, awaiting the touch of Lystralieas's polishing rag,
before going on display.

shelves of magical books stand racks of weapons, from spears to axes, lances
of various sizes, and many of the other weapons found throughout Krynn.  At
the center of the room, a man stands within a circle of glowing powder, a
sword hanging at his side, he reads to his gathered pupils from a tattered
spellbook held in his scarred hands.  Others within the room work upon
practicing their skills with using blades while in combat, the *clack* of
their wooden practice swords heard amongst the pauses of the Guildmaster as
he reads.  To the south, the Avenue of Guilds can be seen.

battle prevent any silence.  A few young men walk about, their eyes upon the
vast selection of weaponry, and nodding they each make their choice and walk
to the back of the room, exitting to the training arena. A small lantern
hangs from the ceiling, the only light in the small room, it plays across
the steel of the wepons, and reflects about upon the stone walls.  Standing
in the center of the room is a large man, weathered by many a battle, he
bears the scars to prove it.  With a grunt, he beckons all whom are willing
to practice their skills in hopes on enhancement.

Music drifts about the room as students either strum, play, or sing

training chamber hangs a large tapestry, upon which in elven, is written the
Song of Huma.  A rather lithe looking elf stands before the students guiding
them through their tune, and with a flourish waves his arms as they reach a
melodic conclusion.  Instruments of all types and sizes rest in cases along
the rose-quartz walls, the care put into them evident by their pristine
conditions.  Others sit at small wooden desks, their quills scribing their
attempts at forming a new tale or song to spread across Krynn while upon
their travels.  To the south, a curtain festooned doorway opens up into the
Avenue of Guilds, where people can be seen stopping to listen to the music

rose-quartz walls of the cleric's training hall.  Qualinesti elves, each
dressed in robes of blue and green, walk about discussing the healing
properties of different herbs and prayers, holy medallions of the Healing
Hand hang about their slender necks.  In the center of the hall, a rather
commanding woman speaks to a group of small children gathered before her. 
Using her hands to emphasize her words, she shares stories of those whom
have given everything to help the populace of Krynn, while strengthening
their faith in the powers of the Light.  To the north, people can be seen
milling about the Avenue of Guilds as they wander the streets of Qualinost.

Tools of all shapes and sizes hang upon the walls, each serving to provide a
certain purpose when smithing.  A gruff looking dwarf grumbles as he walks
about, a hammer swinging at his side, and turning to the few students
gathered he bellows to them of proper hammer technique.  To the north, the

Unlike the other guildhalls, much of the chamber is left open to the
gardens surrounding the rose-quartz building.  Elves wander within the trees
practicing both their skills in swordsmanship and communing with the nature
about them.  A woman clad entirely in green, leather armor stands beneath a
tree, a bird resting in her slender hand, and making small chirps she
nuzzles it closely to her cheek, and lets it soar upward into the trees.  A
few elves have gathered near an open clearing, bows raised in their hands,
and in rhytmic motions they send arrows flying into round targets set some
distance away, their missiles cutting through the air like knives.  To the
south a simply doorway of rose-quartz open back into the civilization of
Qualinost, the paved walk of the Avenue of Guilds extending in both
directions.

the walls.  Elves in green robes, walk about, many stopping to examine the
petals of a small flower or the leaves of other small plants.  The calls of
birds echo throughout the small chamber, as they glide through the trees
that inhabit the guildhall.  To the south the hall opens into a well kept
glade of trees and gardens, in the distance a single doe can be seen
drinking from a small pond.  Everywhere are the fertile signs of nature, the
lifeforce of the soils, air, and seas, the tranquility of life.  To the
north a doorway leads out from the guildhall of the druids and back into the
bustle of the Avenue of Guilds.

A small glass of water darts across the room, born on wings of a
glistening silver it shatters as it strikes the rose-quartz wall.  Several
snickers are emitted from a group of students standing at a table nearby,
one looking forlorn as his enchantment spell goes awry.  Several strange
objects are scattered about the training room, many warped by the minor
enchantments that the students perform to enhance their skills in their art.
A young, human man stands behind a large desk, his back turned to the chaos
chaos as he writes upon a large piece of slate with a bit of chalk.  Turning
back to his students, he asks them to recite the words upon the board, and
explains the significane of pronunciation when speaking them.  To the west a
rune-lined doorway open into the main hall of study within the training
rooms of the magi of Qualinost, white-robed students visible in nearly every
direction.

changing as time slides by, where once there was a depiction of an elven
family resting within the Sacred Grove of Qualinost on a sunny day, now two
lovers are shown embracing under the moonlight of Solinari.  A woman clad in
pristine white robes turns an hourglass upon its its end and annouces a
brief time for rest from study as she looks over her students with apparent
admiration.  To the south, curtain lined doorway opens into the main hall of

with a fluid handwriting upon the parchment.  The instructor calls a young
woman to the front of the room, and as she performs a minor conjuration
spell, he fetches several tomes from his desk and passes the spellbooks
those seated.  Small windows over a light breeze that dances through the

A large skylight opens up into the welcoming embrace of a canopy of
trees, the leaves rustle serenely as a small breeze ushers its way through
the city.  Various pieces of elven-crafted furniture rest about the hall,
providing repose from the bustle of Qualinost.  Servants dressed in the
livery of the Speaker of the Sun rush about, preparing both meals and
entertainment should the Speaker decide upon having company within his home.
To the north, arched doorways open into the gardens of the Palace, rife with
the plants and fruits of Qualinesti, the aroma of the blossums dances upon
the air.  Southward, the hall opens into a large alcove holding more
secluded places to rest if one wishes solace while resting.  Guards stand on
either side of the doorway to the east, nodding to the Speaker's aides as
the exit the Palace to pursue various errands within the city.

An extravagently carved desk rests within the center of the spacious
room, parchments of all kinds spread out upon its lavish surface.  Large
bookcases stand between towering pillars of rosequartz, each dedicated to
the different tastes of the Speaker, ranging from politics to the most
current stories of the bards of Krynn.  A single light hangs above the room,
a brillinat crystal glowing with a tranquil light.  Cut into the stone walls
are glorious windows, each overlooking the entrie city of Qualinost, the
domed rooftops of other buildings visible as they ascend from the treetops
like jewels upon an emerald blanket.  To the north a doorway opens back into
the atrium, a single guard stands before it watching those whom enter the
study with a careful eye, both to keep the possessions of the Speaker safe
and his business private.

Smaller than the spacious atrium to the south, this room offers the
Speaker a place to retire when not entertaining guests, but allows for
meetings of much smaller parties when needed.  A circular couch rests within
the center of the room, its comforting presence offering a seat to the
weary.  Set before the couch, a small table is laden with various types of
fruit and flowers, a pitcher of cool water stands amidst the colorful
collection of refreshments.  Various instruments await their masters upon a
small stage set into the corner of the parlor, each ready to entertain small
audiences with their songs.  To the south, a servant enters the room and
refreshes the table with fruit recently collected from the neighboring
gardens, and finished with his task he turns back into the atrium.

Orbs of light hang from the branches of the surrounding trees, each

colorful fish leaps from within a reflecting pool, sending ripples through
the water as it returns to the depths of the pool.  Chairs line the terrace,
small tables set before them, a few elegantly clad elves resting within
their grasp.  Plants and flowers of all kind dwell within the large gardens,
tended to by only the best nature mages of the elven nation, small paths
meandering between the various plots.  Somewhere, skilled hands pluck the
strings of a harp, providing music to the patrons of the large garden, the
notes mingling amongst the melodic voices of the birds hidden within the
trees.  To the south, the Grand Atrium of the palace can be seen, revealed
by swaying curtains whom have succumbed to the whims of the winds.

rest while enjoying a meal or conversation with others.  Secluded clusters
of chairs sit between massive pillars of rosequartz, their wooden frames
dwarfed by the monstrous stone towers.  Servants walk about the room,
offering their asisstance to those gathered within the large alcove,
providing both food and refreshment to any guests of the Speaker.  Drawing
her slender hands along the gossamer strings of a gilded harp, an elven
bardess plays a slow tune that seems to draw in the overwhelming scene of
the Palace and the city below.  To the north the alcove opens up into the
main atrium of the Palace, where both servants and visitors can be seen
wandering through the spacious dwelling.

Two guards stand ready to protect those within the Palace of the Sun,
should trouble arise, their swords resting in gleaming scabbards of
exquisite craftsmanship.  Between the two elves, a large staircase rises up
into the upper levels of the dwelling where the personal chambers of the
royal family reside.  Servants dance about in an eternal sway of diligence,
each carrying trays or linens to the rooms above, stopping to assist any
visiting nobles as they retire to their chambers.  Hanging from the twisting
railing of the stair are banners of green silk, a brilliant sun of golden
orange sewn expertly upon the glossy fabrics.  To the east stretches the
spacious atrium of the Palace, where others can be seen resting within the
solitude of the Speaker's home.

guard, head of the Speaker's elite bodyguards stands ominously before a
vallenwood door, engraved with the symbol of the sun.  Servants stop to
offer bits of conversation to the guard as he lets them pass into the
private chamber of the Speaker, keeping his well-armed form in the doorway
as he surveys their business with a keen observance.  Portraits of past
Speakers of the Sun rest upon the pink, stone walls, depicting Speakers from
past ages of Krynn, and within which times they served.  Voices call out
from below as people begin their ascent upon the large staircase, having
returned from their travels in the city, or a brief meal within the spacious
atrium of the Palace.

Tapestries dangle from the ceiling, their silken forms swaying in a light
breeze as they stretch their way to the tiled floors.  In the center of the
room stands a large bed, draped in the finest cloths available from
throughout Krynn.  Flames dance along logs within a grated fireplace of
immaculate, white marble, offering warmth to the Speaker as he desires it. 
Servants enter and place trays of food upon a small table set before a
window, their eyes cast down to the floor as if they are invading some
divine plane where they are not meant to be.  Light bearing orbs dangle from
the caverous ceiling, seeming to float in the air as they cast their burden
down upon the extravegently decorated room.  To the east, a large doorway
opens back into the hall at the top of the great staircase, laughter ringing
in the distance as the servants retire to their other duties within the
Palace of the Sun.

path to the west, their robes bearing the many colors of the various guilds

audience chamber of the Senate, twining upwards into the treetops.  About
the small entrance room hang various tapestries of colorful fabrics, the
designs depicting the emblems of the various cities within the Qualinesti
Nation.  Scribes diligently work behind large desks, their quill pens
scribbling away the various documents used by the Senate to maintain order

Built like an ampitheatre, wooden benches cirle the large room, ascending
in level as they span upwards to the boundaries of the chamber.  In the
center of the room stands a large podium, crafted of wood, gold, and silver,
bearing the symbol of the Sun.  Two noblemen rest at a bench near the
podium, their conversation barely audible as they whisper of the current
politics about Krynn, the younger elf useing his hands animatedly as he goes
further into depth with his elder.  A young, Qualinesti woman enbters the
room, and taking a few delicate steps towards the podium, she turns to cast
a curious glance about the room, her naive gaze falling upon those gathered
as she seats herself.  The domed ceiling above is composed of the
surrounding trees and rosequartz, crafted by elven nature mages to help
protect the chamber from the ravages of weather, and providing an acoustical
boost to the voice of he current speaker.  On the southern end of the
chamber, a staircase descends back to the atrium of the Senate's chamers.  
 
A small {cnote{x hangs upon the wall.

the room, behind which a spiralled staircase of intricately crafted
rose-quartz leads to the upper balconies of the audience chamber.  Various
members of the Qualinesti senate stand about, taking their places in the
chairs surrounding the podium their eyes glancing about as they seat
themselves.  An elven man, clad in robes of lustrous gold announces the
arrival of Lords and Ladies from about Krynn.  Large, circular windows open
the large chamber to the gardens about the tower, and a light breeze sweeps
through the room, causing the tapestries upon the walls to sway as if they
too were simply exquisite windows into the elegant gardens of the elves.

Upper Chambers of the Tower~
A grand balcony circles the audience chamber below, various chairs and
tables line the elegently wrought railing of intertwined gold ond ivy. 
People can be seen below, gathering before the podium of the Speaker of the
Sun.  Circular windows dot the rose-quartz walls, opening into the deep sky
of the horizon, birds flitting in and out from the tower like playful
children.  Elves wander about, many in the rich dress of the noble families,
and the robes of the well-known Senate of the Qualinesti, they whisper in
hushed voices, but turn their attention below as they watch those gathered. 
Above, the large staircase circles upwards into the depths of the tower,
twisting onward as it bathes in the glowing light of the golden spire.

Courtyard of the Palace~
A small fountain sprays water into the air, casting a fine mist about the
courtyard as the droplets are caught upon the dancing winds.  Stoic
guardians wait on either side of the doorway into the palace, their bodies
at alert for an intruders within the palace grounds.  To the north, a small
fence of silver poles provides a boundary for the royal gardens and the
verdant clearings within which the Speaker and his guests reside within when
seeking peace from the city.  Birds sway merrily upon the winds, their small
forms gliding southward toward the expanse of the city of Qualinost, each
calling out to the others as they fly.  To the west, a grand doorway opens
into the palace of the Speaker, where only those closest to the leader of
the Qualinesti Nation may enter.  Southward, a small, stone stairway winds
its way back down to the gates before the Palace offering a return to the
bustle of the elven streets.
