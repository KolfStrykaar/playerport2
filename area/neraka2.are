Shrine of the Black Moon~
The passage here is littered with rubble.  The surrounding walls are
cracked in many places, and the ceiling has suffered a partial collapse.  At
the end of the passage lies an elaborate shrine.  Sculpted of obsidian
harvested from the volcanic range known as the Lords of Doom, it is engraved
with various magical symbols.  At the top, a perfect sphere of onyx hovers
in midair.  Meant to resemble the black moon of Nuitari, it whirls in
perpetual motion; emitting a soft hum.  Here, servants of the black robes
offer their lives and prayers to the Dark Son, hoping to receive his
blessings in order to strengthen their dark magics.

statue of the platinum dragon surrounded by the gods of good stare at the
statue of the five headed dragon and her consorts.  Statues of the grey
gods stand in between them keeping the peace.  Clerics of all types are here
deep in prayer at the foot of their chosen god's statue.

{bThe Blue Quarter{x~
You are in the middle of the Blue Quarter.  Citizens and officers in the
Blue dragonarmy are bustling about the place looking very busy.  This
quarter is one of the biggest quarters of the city and is quite spacious. 
The mighty city walls don’t seem quite so threatening here but their shadows
still chill you.  The quarter continues to the west and to the east.  A dark
sense of choking evil exudes from a building to the north.  The symbol of
the five headed dragon is etched onto the door post.  To the south stands a
shop.  A blue hammer is painted onto a sign above the door.

You are within the Blue Hammer.  This weapon shop is full of weapons and
instruments of death.  The walls are lined with paintings of warriors using
the weapons on display in various scenes of battle.  There are racks of
finely crafted weaponry throughout the store.  The light from the many
lanterns and torches along the walls gleams off the fine steelwork.  This
shop mainly caters for the not so well off officers of the blue dragonarmy.

This dark building is constantly chill.  Even when the sunlight pours
through the stained windows the room never warms.  The windows are stained
with dark and disturbing patterns of death and decay.  When the light of the
sun or the moons hit these windows nightmarish patterns appear on the floor.
Set near the north wall of this dread room is a dark altar devoted to the
Dark Queen.  Idols of the lesser dark gods are arranged around the altar in
eternal homage to the statue of the Five Headed Dragon standing behind the
altar.

ever need.  The shopkeeper will also serve other mages and members of the
other classes but it is clear that the main custom here is from the dark
ones.  The grey robed knights rarely come out to this part of the city
although they too sometimes come here searching for stock that has perhaps
run low in the inner city.

This large tavern is surprisingly comfortable and clean.  The furniture
all appears to be in one piece though a few splinters lie on the floors here
and there.  The patrons all appear to be officers or higher ranked soldiers
in the blue dragonarmy.  Spending their wages relaxing after a long duty
and discussing events with their fellow officers.  Several draconians sit
around the many tables drinking heavily and clawing at several serving girls
when they pass too close.  Every so often loud bursts of laughter can be
heard ringing about the place as one of the younger officers falls to the
floor losing yet another drinking contest with his older commander.

reside here.  Protected from the outside world by the huge city walls of

Flashes of light can be seen through the slits from what can only be the
armor of troops and arrowheads.  The gate itself is made of large beams of
wood mounted upon well oiled hinges.  This gate looks like it can withstand
a large force of aggressors for quite some time.  At least enough time to

This cheap looking and ill used building looks as though it could fall apart
at any minute.  But as long as there is a roof to keep rainwater out of
their drinks the patrons don't seem to mind.  That or they are too drunk to
care.  The floor of the bar is covered with sawdust and straw.  It is clear
from the stench that the sawdust is not often cleared out.  Blood and vomit
are soaked into most parts of the sawdust.  From the broken bits of
furniture lying around it is clear that bar brawls happen here on a regular
basis.

attendant clerics is no less powerful than the chill churches of the city.

and are simply dirt avenues.  Sidewalks line the streets to keep those that
choose to walk here out of the horrible mud.  If it rains here the streets
become rivers of thick mud.  The wooden sidewalks are buckled from overuse
and wood rot but manage to keep people out of the mud.  Unless of course they
have to cross the street.  To the north stands a massive gate surrounded by
the mighty walls of Neraka.  The muddy roads continue to the east and to the
south.

You stand in an inner district of the city.  The heart of the city is

district of the Red Quarter.  Along the northern wall sits a small table
surrounded by chairs arranged as though more gambling occurs here than
actual guarding.  The other wall is a circular wall making the whole
building semi circular.  Along this curved wall are small windows giving the
guards excellent views of the district around them.  The windows are narrow
and tapered so that while they give excellent views out it is difficult to
peer into the building from outside.

You stand in a fairly clean and well furnished tavern.  Like most taverns
in the inner districts it is occupied by officers of the red dragonarmy.  A
few older officers sit reciting tales of the glorious battles they were in
as young recruits during the war of the lance.  Although the armies were
routed after the war they were reformed and regrouped here at Neraka. 
Although now one army the units are still separated by color.  A few
younger officers sit in hope that one of the knights will come in and tell
of sweeping conquests rather than old conquests from times forgotten.  A
sign on the wall indicates that the bar is closed but patrons are welcome to
enjoy the fellowship of the tavern.

This dark building is constantly chill.  Even when the sunlight pours
through the stained windows the room never warms.  The windows are stained
with dark and disturbing patterns of death and decay.  When the light of the
sun or the moons hit these windows nightmarish patterns appear on the floor.
Set near the north wall of this dread room is a dark altar devoted to the
Dark Queen.  Idols of the lesser dark gods are arranged around the altar in
eternal homage to the statue of a large serpent standing behind the altar.

This cheap looking and ill used building looks as though it could fall apart

their drinks the patrons don't seem to mind.  That or they are too drunk to
care.  The floor of the bar is covered with sawdust and straw.  It is clear
from the stench that the sawdust is not often cleared out.  Blood and vomit
are soaked into most parts of the sawdust.  From the broken bits of

You are in the Red Quarter of the evil city of Neraka.  This is one of
the largest quarters of the city and appears to be very busy.  Officers and
soldiers are moving around everywhere busily hurrying about their tasks
while their families bustle about in their normal city lives.  This area of
the city is predominately filled with members and families of the red dragon
army.  The occasional flash of figures dressed in black catch your eye.  The
quarter continues to the east and to the west.

{rThe Red Shield{x~
You are within the Red Shield.  This armourer sells quality crafted
armor to the high ranking soldiers and officers of the red dragonarmy. 
The citizens of Neraka also come to this store to buy armor for themselves.
The shopkeeper does pretty well since the officers of the Dark Queen's
forces are normally well paid.  The room is fairly comfortable and the walls
are decorated with paintings of Lord Verminaard conquering Ansalon. 
Paintings of Lord Toede take a lesser place among the paintings upon the
wall.  The walls are also decorated with fine armor from days long past. 
These are part of the shopkeeper's personal collection.

towers.  Each one is covered with arrow slits and observation holes. 
Flashes of light can be seen through the slits from what can only be the
armor of troops and arrowheads.  The gate itself is made of large beams of
wood mounted upon well oiled hinges.  This gate looks like it can withstand
a large force of aggressors for quite some time.  At least enough time to
prepare the defense of the inner city.

need.  The shopkeeper will also serve other mages and members of the other

The grey robed knights rarely come out to this part of the city although
they too sometimes come here searching for stock that has perhaps run low in
the inner city.

This cheap looking and ill used building looks as though it could fall apart
at any minute.  But as long as there is a roof to keep rainwater out of
their drinks the patrons don't seem to mind.  That or they are too drunk to
care.  The floor of the bar is covered with sawdust and straw.  It is clear
from the stench that the sawdust is not often cleared out.  Blood and vomit
are soaked into most parts of the sawdust.  From the broken bits of
furniture lying around it is clear that bar brawls happen here on a regular

You stand in a fairly clean and well furnished tavern.  Like most taverns
in the inner districts it is occupied by officers of the green dragonarmy. 
A few older officers sit reciting tales of the glorious battles they were in
as young recruits during the war of the lance.  Although the armies were
routed after the war they were reformed and regrouped here at Neraka. 
Although now one army the units are still separated by color.  A few
younger officers sit in hope that one of the knights will come in and tell
of sweeping conquests rather than old conquests from times forgotten.  A
sign on the wall indicates that the bar is closed but patrons are welcome to
enjoy the fellowship of the tavern.

are decorated with paintings of Lord Salah-Kahn the dragon Highlord of the

{gA Dark Church{x~
This small wooden building is certainly not as splendid in its evil as
the churches within the city.  The small altar dedicated to Takhisis has no
statue adorning it and there are no fine images of destruction or the
Queen's might.  This church serves the lowest warriors and soldiers of the
green dragonarmy.  The sense of evil power oozing from the altar and the
attendant clerics is no less powerful than the chill churches of the city. 
The Queen's presence is strong here among her foot soldiers.

You are in the Green Quarter of the outer city of Neraka.  The walls of
the city itself loom before you.  Atop the mighty walls are guards standing
watch over the outer city.  The streets before you are covered in thick
oozing mud.  Wooden walkways line either side of the streets keeping people
out of the mud.  The walkways themselves are old and appear to be rotting. 
Patches of new wood have been thrown down around the buildings here.  The
wooden walkways continue to the north and to the south.

You are inside a sturdy stone building with small windows on all sides. 
This building appears to be purpose built to allow a large detachment of
guards to spend a whole duty shift watching the city around them. 
Occasionally guards will march out of here and patrol the streets bringing
back any untoward persons for interrogation.  Small holding cells can be
seen here to put these undesirables into before either being taken to the
pens for a term of imprisonment or to be taken before the army’s commander
for further questioning.  Between the windows are the banners of the green
dragonarmy.  Each army is responsible for the well being of its own quarter.

You stand next to a large pit in the ground.  A vile smell wafts from
within and a nasty green mist is emanating from it.  Peering over the edge
of the pit you can see hundreds of bodies in various states of decay lie
dead in the pit.  The bodies are those of many different races all tossed
into the pit by dragonarmy soldiers.  It seems the dead are not properly
buried in Neraka they are simply brought to this hideous place and tossed
into it unceremoniously.  The Green Quarter continues to the east.

with dark and disturbing patterns of death and decay.  When the light of the
sun or the moons hit these windows nightmarish patterns appear on the floor.
Set near the north wall of this dread room is a dark altar devoted to the
Dark Queen.  Idols of the lesser dark gods are arranged around the altar in
eternal homage to the statue of a large hydra standing behind the altar.

collecting from rain water and sewage dumped into the tunnels through the

appear to have suffered some structural damage.  The famed undercity of
Neraka as it used to be was partially destroyed when the Dark Queen was
defeated at the end of the war of the lance.  The tunnels of the undercity
continue to the west.  Above you can be heard the sounds of the thieves

clearly not part of the old sewer system and looks much older.  The walls
show signs of great structural strain.  When Neraka fell at the end of the
war of the lance the Undercity took a pounding.  Most of the older passages
such as this one were destroyed.  The eastern wall is cracked but there is
something odd about the cracks.  The tunnel leads back out to the sewer
system to the west.

of the city after the War of the Lance, many of these crypts were lost or
destroyed.  Rubble lies about the place, and large chunks of the walls and
ceiling are missing.  This crypt appears to have survived the fall
relatively well.  One large piece of rock has fallen from the ceiling and
smashed open one of the tombs, however; its occupant lies in pieces on the
floor around it.  An eerie glow emanates from both the walls and tombs
themselves.  No doubt Chemosh has had his unholy hand here.

You have fallen with the rushing water into the catacombs.  The water

water falling from above stops you from getting back out into the tunnels. 
The walls of the catacombs have a strange eerie glow.  Maybe whatever is
causing the glowing is stopping any transportation magic being cast.
You appear to be trapped.

Undercity of Neraka~
You are in a dark and smelly tunnel.  The bad smell wafting up from the
floor indicates that this used to be the sewer system of Neraka.  The tunnel
itself is a large cylindrical tunnel roughly eight feet in diameter.  Along
the bottom of the tunnel runs water roughly a foot deep.  The tunnel bends
eastwards here and the water flows from the south crashing against the
northern wall before heading eastwards.  The sound of falling water can be
heard echoing through the tunnels.

The Emperor's Cache~
You have wondered into emperor Ariakas's secret chamber.  The location of
this room and its very existence was a closely guarded secret during the war
of the lance.  The room was so secret that only the emperor Highlord Ariakas
and his dragon mount knew of it.  After the war rumors were spread of the
hidden wealth of the dragon highlords.  Many believed that it was taken to
Sanction when Highlord Kitiara regrouped her troops.  Others still secretly
search for it even though the city is now reoccupied.  The room glows with a
golden light.  Red dragon scales litter the floor.  Unfortunately for you
this was also Ariakas's dragon mount’s lair.

the stone work is crumbling.  A strong crushing sense of evil oozes all

collapsing in on top of you.  The awful feeling of evil grows worse to the

The Ruined Guardroom~
During the glory days of the temple of Neraka this level of the temple
was often filled with the Queen's troops.  The draconians would train here
and the dark clerics would worship here.  This ruined room was once used by
troops of the dragonarmies to keep order deep below the temple.  All
passageways used to lead through these rooms and security was tight. 
However now this room is in ruins.  Debris lies all about the place and the
walls are cracked and damaged.  Ruined passageways lead out of here to the
east and to the west.

appears to be oozing from a passageway to the north like blood from a wound.
Fortunately this passageway is completely blocked off.  Whatever is down
there must have been near the epicenter of the awesome power that destroyed
this temple originally.  The rubble is impassable.  To the south however a
gap in the mounds of rubble will allow you to pass through.

came to these dungeons never left alive.  To the east lies the cell blocks
while to the north through the gaps in the rubble is a ruined passageway.

Inquisitor's Court~
You are inside the Inquisitor's court.  This room and its contents seem
to have escaped much of the damage evident around the rest of the temple
dungeons.  Torture devices hang from the walls each one is sinisterly lit
from above by continual light spells allowing menacing shadows to loom
beneath them.  Rich blood red tapestries hang about the walls in various
states of repair between the torture devices.  A raised platform stands at
the eastern wall where the Inquisitor would interrogate his prisoners. 
Screams and wails of agony emanate from a chamber to the south.

The Torture Chamber~
You are within the torture chamber of the temple of Neraka.  The horrors
of this room are legendary even among the troops of the dark armies.  The
room is lit by balls of continual light displaying all of the hideous
torture devices that line the room.  Around the room you can see vats of
seething acid and slow-burning coal fires heating various metal implements. 
Various cages and tanks dot the room containing spiders, snakes, leeches,
rats and other foul creatures.  At the back of the room you can see the
source of the screaming.  A spirit lies prostate on a torture device in a
state of eternal torment.  This unfortunate soul was obviously being
tortured as the temple collapsed.  You can see no way to free this damned
soul.

A Crumbling Passageway~
The crumbling walls of this passageway are covered with dark bloodstains.
The awful sound of wailing and pain filled screams echo all around you.  The
suffocating sense of evil is very powerful here.  Its hard to breath in
these cramped crushing passageways.  Evil flows through this place like the
water flows through the sewers.  The passageway continues to the north and
to the east while to the west a large room opens out before you.  A strange
humming sound can be heard from a passage to the south.

layers of dust lie thick around them.  There are booted trails running
through the dust and it is evident that living persons have passed through
here recently.  The passages continue to the north and to the east.

You are inside the dark abbey.  This huge circular room takes the form of
a large bowl.  Benches are arranged around the room in concentric circles
all facing towards the center.  A huge altar stands at the center of the
room and upon the altar stands a huge life sized and very lifelike statue of
the Five Headed Dragon.  A sense of pure evil radiates from the statue and
washes over you like waves in the sea.

as though beyond the wall was someplace not of this world.  Terrible wails

A Ruined Guardroom~
During the glory days of the temple of Neraka this level of the temple
was often filled with the Queen's troops.  The draconians would train here
and the dark clerics would worship here.  This ruined room was once used by
troops of the dragonarmies to keep order deep below the temple.  All
passageways used to lead through these rooms and security was tight. 
However now this room is in ruins.  Debris lies all about the place and the
walls are cracked and damaged.  A ruined archway leads out to the north.

this temple originally.  The rubble is impassable.  The passageways continue

hanging from the ceiling.  The council chamber opens out to the north while
the sound of prayers and a strong sense of evil oozes from the west.

Altar to the Queen of Darkness~
You are in a large chamber totally dedicated to the Queen of Darkness. 
The walls here are decorated with foul paintings and images of the Dark
Queen in all her guises.  Among these images is a painting depicting the
Dark Warrior in a cave with Lord Ariakan as he receives the vision of the
new order of knights.  At the western wall is an altar made of pure black
polished marble.  Behind the altar is a twelve foot high statue of the Queen
of Darkness.

A Passageway in the Temple of Darkness~
You are inside the dreaded Temple of Darkness.  Evil pulses all around
you, constricting your stomach and your heart.  The suffocating evil is
almost unbearable even to those with the darkest of souls.  The walls of the
temple are made from black stone and are lit by continual light spells
hanging from the ceiling.  To the west the council chamber opens out before
you while to the south the strange spidery language of magic can be heard.

{DDark Library{x~
You are within the library of the Temple of Darkness.  Here many tomes of
wisdom are kept including histories of the Dark Queen's forces and volumes
of magical history are also kept here.  After the rebuilding of the temple
many ancient scrolls were recovered and brought here from all around Neraka
and the surrounding areas.  Mixed with the books the knights themselves
brought this room will soon be filled with dark and secret texts.

A Shadowy Alcove~
You are within a shadowy alcove on the second level of the Temple of
Darkness.  A huge towering staircase stands before you ascending in a
clockwise direction.  This gives an advantage to defenders of the temple. 
Right handed attackers have less room to swing their sword arm when coming up
the stairs but defenders fighting down the stairs have more room.  To the
east another staircase spirals downwards while to the south is a wide
balcony.

A Shadowy Balcony~
You are on a shadowy balcony over looking the main council chambers. 
During the war of the lance the dragon highlords had thrones set just a
little lower than where this balcony now stands.  This balcony was created
for dark pilgrims and other visitors to the temple to reflect on the majesty
of the Dark Queen Herself.  Above the balcony you can see a large gantry
leading to five shadowy alcoves.  Each one is surrounded by the colors and
trappings of one of the dragonarmies.  The balcony continues to the east and
to the west.  To the north lies a large shadowy alcove.
