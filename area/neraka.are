The Road to Neraka~
You stand on the road to Neraka.  To the south you can see the mighty
city of evil.  A dark oppressive force of pure evil exudes from the heart of
the walled city itself.  Surrounding the city are the old camps of the
various dragonarmies from the War of the Lance.  These camps have been built
up into small towns that seem to embrace the walled city itself.

Before the Gates of Neraka~
To the south looms the mighty fortress like gatehouse of the evil city of
Neraka.  The towers of the gatehouse loom before you.  The mighty iron gates
are guarded night and day by troops of the Dark Queen.  To the east a path
stretches around the walled city and appears to lead to a section of the
outer city.  The path appears well traveled and you can clearly make out
tracks of booted soldiers and numerous slave trains passing through here.

The Gates of Neraka~
Here the mighty iron gates of Neraka stand before you.  The massive gates
are flanked on either side by guard stations in the gatehouse.  Through the
arrow slits in the walls you can see glints of light shining off armor and
weapons.  The sturdy gates themselves are closed and from the moss that is
growing under them it appears that they have not swung open since the
dragonarmies paraded into the city during the war of the lance.  There is a
door in the gates leading into the city.  This door appears large enough for
troops on horseback to enter the city to the south.  There are also doors on
either side of the gates leading into the fortress.

The Western Guardhouse~
You are inside the mighty fortress that serves as the gatehouse to
Neraka.  This is a guard station used to house those troops that watch over
the mighty gates and scrutinize all those that seek entry into the city. 
The arrow slits in the north wall give a fairly good view of the plains of
Neraka and especially the road leading to the city itself.  From here those
approaching can be seen quickly and the guards can be scrambled with little
notice.  The door to the east leads out to the gates and a door to the south
gives access to the city.  The fortress continues on to the west where
stairs can be seen leading upwards.

At the Base of the Western Tower~
You are deep within the fortress like building that serves as the
gatehouse for the evil city of Neraka.  You are standing at the base of one
of the mighty towers that loom threateningly over the plains of Neraka
almost daring an assault on the city.  The walls are lit with torches here
and the arrow slits and murder holes give a limited view of the plains. 
Here though any attacking force would be first met with the arrows of the
city guard safely hidden between these mighty walls.  There are circular
stairs leading upwards.

A Landing in the Tower~
You have come to a landing leading from a set of circular stairs.  The
stairs ascend in a clockwise direction.  This gives defenders of the stairs
an advantage should attackers penetrate the fortress.  Right handed
attackers are less able to use their sword arm while assaulting such a
staircase.  The walls are lined with arrow slits.  These are dotted around
the staircase with small platforms for archers to stand from.  Each platform
allowing enough space to hide behind the mighty walls and maneuver
successfully.  A door to the east allows further access to the fortress.

Top of the Western Tower~
You stand at the top of the tower.  Through the holes in the walls you
can observe the whole city and its surrounding plains.  To the north you can
see the plains of Neraka and the road snaking off to the north.  To the
northwest you can see the hustle and bustle of the White Quarter of the
city.  To the southwest is the green quarter.  The red quarter can just be
seen at the south of the city.  The southeast hoses the blue quarter and the
black quarter is to the northeast of the city.  The path at the north of the
city leads off into the black quarter and leads to a large structure.

In the Gatehouse of Neraka~
You are within the walls of the mighty gatehouse fortress of Neraka. 
Torches line the walls in sconces providing light within these walls. 
Arrow slits are arranged across the wall to provide excellent cover against
attacking forces.  Peering through one of them you can see how any unwanted
guests could be shot easily from here.  The fortress is very wide here and
you can see that this building can garrison at least five hundred men.  In
times of war you can imagine this room filled with soldiers in dark armor
standing ready to crush the forces of good.

Above the Gates~
The northern wall of this large garrison is filled with holes and arrow
slits.  Hideous death must befall all those that were to be beneath this
place if the defenders felt threatened.  It is obvious from the piles of
straw on the floor and the slumbering troops that this also acts as the
barracks for the city guard.  When on duty the troops will give up their
beds to those that are coming off watch.  Troops could possibly live in here
for months without ever leaving the gatehouse and from the stench of the
place you guess that they probably do not.

In the Gatehouse of Neraka~
The walls here are lined with torches in sconces that light this mighty
fortress.  There are buckets filled with sand about the place.  These would
be used to douse any fires that were burning in the garrison.  Between the
sconces the walls are filled with arrow slits where skilled archers can pick
off any would be attackers coming from the plains surrounding the evil city.
Through the arrow slits you can clearly see the plains and the road leading
north.  You can also see the trail that lines the city walls.

A Landing in the Tower~
You are on a landing of the stairs in the eastern tower.  The stairs go
upwards to the top of the tower and downwards to the ground floor.  The
staircase ascends in a clockwise direction.  This interferes with right
handed swordsmen as they attack up the stairs.  Thus giving the fortress
defenders a distinct advantage.  Arrow slits line the walls of this tower. 
Small platform lead off from the stairs under each arrow slit allowing
archers full access to them and leaving them with enough room to maneuver. 
There is a door to the west.

observation holes you can see almost all of the city to the south and the
surrounding plains.  You can see the black quarter to the northeast of the
city and the trail that runs from before the gates to a large structure in
this quarter.  You can see what looks like slaves being led into and out of
the structure.  To the east of the city you can see the busy blue quarter
with its large open markets.  To the south you can just see the red quarter
sprawling away from you.  The green quarter is to the southwest of the city
and the white to the northwest.

spirals upwards in a counter clockwise direction.  Sconces hold torches
along the walls of this mighty fortress lighting the way for the many
soldiers and city guards garrisoned here.  Between the sconces the walls are
lined with arrow slits and observation holes.  Through here the city guard
can defend the city gates with deadly effectiveness.  The arrow slits in the
eastern wall give a clear view of slaves being thrust into pens in the black
quarter of the city.

watch all those that approach the gates thorough arrow slits and observation
holes in the northern wall.  Through these arrow slits any attacking force
can be spotted approaching from the plains and the archers can make ready to
pick them off one by one.  The fortress continues on to the east where you
can see a staircase leading up into the tower.  The door to the west leads
out into the gate.  The guards can quickly scrabble from here to halt all
those that approach the massive iron structure.  To the south a door leads
into a massive square in the city.

breach the main gate what was left of them could easily be stopped here.  To

Knights of Takhisis and the old remnants of the dragonarmies.  You stand in
a mighty square known as The Emperor's Court.  Here the dragonarmies paraded
into the city overseen by the self styled emperor Dragon Highlord Ariakas. 
To the north the mighty iron gates of the city stand shut and barred.  The

small part of the court and cut to pieces by the defending troops.  To the

lance.  It still has a twisted and deranged looking exterior but it was
built by human hands and not by Takhisis Herself.  The Temple Square

these gates are usually open.  Built to stop fighting between different
factions of the dragonarmies; these gates can hold up an aggressive force
allowing the city guards to repel them more easily.

Invading forces could be channeled down this road and picked off by the city
guards on top of the walls.  The road stretches on to the north and to the

to stop fighting between different factions of the dragonarmies; these gates
can hold up an aggressive force allowing the city guards to repel them more
easily.

An Inner City Gate~
You are at the end of the road in the Blue Quarter.  Before you to the
south stands a large wooden gate flanked by two tall towers.  Flashes of
light off armor and weapons can be seen through the arrow slits in the
towers.  In one tower the glints of light have a blueish tint and from the
other tower the light appears to be reflected off red armor.  It seems that
the gate is guarded by troops from the old red dragonarmy and troops from
the blue dragonarmy.  To the north the road stretches on into the blue

{mInner District of Black Quarter{x~
You stand in an inner district of the city.  The heart of the city is
usually only inhabited by high ranking officers in the Dark Queen's forces. 
Around you the same walls stand tall blocking your view of all but the
district within which you stand.  The soldiers patrolling the walls are
usually watching the Queen's Way but often cast a wary eye into the area
watching for trouble.  The Black Quarter of the city is fairly unusual since
it does not house the officers that now lead the remainder of the black
dragonarmy.  This area is instead decked out with the insignia of the City
Guard.

{mBefore the Blockhouse{x~
You stand in the heart of the inner black district.  There is not a black
dragonarmy officer in sight.  Standing to the west is a massive blockhouse
flying the flag of the City Guard of Neraka.  The mark of the five headed
dragon upon the walls of the blockhouse indicate that there is some form of
temple to the Dark Queen inside.  The guards atop the mighty walls of the
city appear to be watching this part of the inner city as intently as they
watch the roads.  There is a grating in the road here covering a hole big
enough for an ogre to crawl through.

{mThe Blockhouse{x~
You are in a large building.  The room you are in is very large and
clearly serves many purposes.  There are desks filled with clerks and high
ranking officers of the City Guard making daily reports.  A foul acrid odor
fills the air emanating from the southern wall.  A sense of cold pure evil
oozes from the same direction.  A quick glance reveals an altar to the Dark
Queen stands there.  Attended by dark clerics the City Guard can worship
here away from the public churches and the temple.  To the west lies a large
cellblock.  The north houses what appears to be the City Guard barracks.

This cellblock is used by the City Guard.  They bring any persons found
inside the city walls without the relevant authorization here to be
questioned by the Captain of the guard.  The cells appear to be very
uncomfortable.  The floors are made of hard stone with only a little straw
scattered about each cell.  The straw might once have been relatively
comfortable but most of it seems to have been used to mop up blood and other
nasty things associated with prison cells.  The main room of the blockhouse
is to the east.

This part of the blockhouse is full of bunks made of straw with wooden

weariness of their shifts.  The northern part of the room appears to be some
sort of mess hall.  Since the guards come in on regular shift patterns the
meals are served here after each shift and before each shift.  This way the
guards are fed properly and effectively.  A set of stairs stand away from
the main guard's area.  The stairs ascend in a clockwise direction.

quarters are separated from the office portion of this floor.  Here the
Captain interrogates all those brought before him by his elite City Guard. 
Those that do not satisfy his questions are taken to the inquisitors in
their chambers below the Queen's temple.  The office appears fairly
comfortable and is carpeted with a soft yet practical carpet.  Whilst not
living in the lap of luxury this officer certainly lives better than most
common soldiers.  The spiral stairs lead down into the main barracks of the

side by two tall towers.  Each one is covered with arrow slits and
observation holes.  Flashes of light can be seen through the slits from what
can only be the armor of troops and arrowheads.  The gate itself is made of
large beams of wood mounted upon well oiled hinges.  This gate looks like it

here almost as devout as the black robed clerics in their worship of
Takhisis.  The eastern wall of this church is filled with hideous and
deformed imagery of the Queen in her many guises.  Images of Her Dark
Majesty line the walls depicting gruesome torture scenes and radiant
glorious darkness.  The altar itself stands in the center of the room
attended by dark clerics.  A crushing sense of pure evil oozes from a statue
of The Temptress standing atop the altar. To the north, lies the entrance

You stand in a rough but fairly clean tavern.  Unlike the other dragon
taverns this is not in the Inner Districts.  However it is still mainly
occupied by officers of the black dragonarmy due to the prices being too
high for the wage of the common soldier.  A few older officers sit reciting
tales of the glorious battles they were in as young recruits during the war
of the lance.  Although the armies were routed after the war they were
reformed and regrouped here at Neraka.  Although now one army the units are
still separated by color.  A few younger officers sit in hope that one of
the knights will come in and tell of sweeping conquests rather than old
conquests from times forgotten.  With the tavern out in this part of the
city however the young officers are mainly disappointed.

new skills or practice the skills they have already learnt.  Glints of gold
and the sparkle of diamonds and amethysts just barely visible from behind
the guildmaster makes you realize just how good they are.

from the stench that the sawdust is not often cleared out.  Blood and vomit
are soaked into most parts of the sawdust.  From the broken bits of

You are inside a sturdy stone building with small windows on all sides. 
This building appears to be purpose built to allow a large detachment of
guards to spend a whole duty shift watching the city around them. 
Occasionally guards will march out of here and patrol the streets bringing
back any untoward persons for interrogation.  Small holding cells can be
seen here to put these undesirables into before either being taken to the
pens for a term of imprisonment or to be taken before the armys commander
for further questioning.  Between the windows are the banners of the black
dragonarmy.  Each army is responsible for the well being of its own quarter.

slaver pens can be watched closely and any escaping slaves or dodgy
merchants can be shot down from here.  To the west guards can watch the
muddy roads leading around the walls of the city itself.  These massive

{mBlack Quarter of Outer City{x~
You are in the Black Quarter of the outer city.  The roads are very muddy
and are simply dirt avenues.  Sidewalks line the streets to keep those that
choose to walk here out of the horrible mud.  If it rains here the streets
become rivers of thick mud.  The wooden sidewalks are buckled from overuse
and wood rot but manage to keep people out of the mud.  Unless of course they
have to cross the street.  To the north stands a large stone building with a
wooden door leading into it.  From the insignia above the door this appears
to be a guardhouse.  To the east a large structure stands with several rich
officers hanging around it.  To the west a dirt road snakes off and the
muddy streets of the outer city continue to the south.

{mA Guardhouse{x~
You are inside a sturdy stone building with small windows on all sides. 
This building appears to be purpose built to allow a large detachment of
guards to spend a whole duty shift watching the city around them. 
Occasionally guards will march out of here and patrol the streets bringing
back any untoward persons for interrogation.  Small holding cells can be
seen here to put these undesirables into before either being taken to the
pens for a term of imprisonment or to be taken before the armys commander
for further questioning.  Between the windows are the banners of the black
dragonarmy.  Each army is responsible for the well being of its own
quarter.  A door leads out into the black quarter to the south and stone
steps lead up to the next level of the guardhouse.

can see that there are observation points and arrow slits around the walls. 
Looking through these windows to the south gives an excellent view of the
surrounding Black Quarter of the city.  The view to the north gives a good
view of the plains of Neraka stretching out before the guardhouse.  Through
the east window the activities of the slaver pens can be watched closely and
any escaping slaves or dodgy merchants can be shot down from here.  To the
west guards can watch the muddy roads leading around the walls of the city
itself.  These massive walls dominate this view and dwarfs those looking

{mThe Slaver Pens{x~
You stand in a large structure built out of wooden timber framing.  The
main structure simply exists to keep the weather from bothering the slave
masters and the prospective buyers.  Large iron gratings cover a massive pit
below the structure in which the young fit and healthy people of Krynn
caught opposing the Dark Queen's forces are held.  These poor specimens have
been captured and brought to Neraka for the finest and wealthiest of the
Dark Queen's officers to take as slaves.  To the north and to the east
buyers can walk over the gratings and look down into the pits viewing the
slaves on offer.  Here the grating can be opened allowing access down into
the pits for the more wealthy to get a hands on viewing of the merchandise.

You are down inside the pit known as The Slaver Pens.  All around you
young men and women of different races are being herded into small
individual pens.  Above you is a large iron grating with catwalks running
over them.  High ranking dragonarmy officers and the occasional Knight of
Takhisis look down through the gratings looking at the living merchandise. 
The prisoners here appear to be clean and healthy looking.  It would not do
for a wealthy nobleman favored by the Queen Herself to purchase a dirty and
mistreated slave.  The pens continue to the north and to the east.  But
only the slave masters are allowed into these parts of the pens.

several fit young men.  These young men appear very fit and agile.  These
slaves will probably be used as runners and messengers.  Often women from the
dark churches and the female officers come here and buy the handsome young
men as slaves.

routed after the war they were reformed and regrouped here at Neraka. 
Although now one army the units are still separated by color.  A few

of sweeping conquests rather than old conquests from times forgotten.

{wThe{x {mBlack{x {wMoon{x~
The pungent smell of spell components and foul smelling potions fills
your nostrils.  This magic shop has everything the black robed mage would
ever need.  The shopkeeper will also serve other mages and members of the
other classes but it is clear that the main custom here is from the dark
ones.  The grey robed knights rarely come out to this part of the city
although they too sometimes come here searching for stock that has perhaps
run low in the inner city.

{wEnd of White Quarter{x~
You are at the end of the White Quarter of the dark city of Neraka.  This
portion of the city is controlled and governed by the white dragonarmy. 
Looking around you can see officers and the families of the white dragon
army.  The occasional low ranking soldier flits among the crowd carrying out
errands quickly so that he can enjoy the taverns of the inner city.  This
portion of the White Quarter is once again walled.  The looming high walls
of Neraka block the way out into the outer city.  There are also high walls
here within the city separating this quarter from the next.  Though the
knights demand a unified army the soldiers still prefer to live separately
in honor of the old days during the war of the lance.  To the east stands a
shop.  The wooden board above the shop door shows a crude painting of a
white crested helm.

{wThe White Helm{x~
You are inside The White Helm.  This armourer is used by the officers of
the White dragonarmy and citizens of the city.  The shopkeeper does pretty
well since the officers of the Dark Queen's forces are normally well paid. 
The room is fairly comfortable and the walls are decorated with some
paintings of Feal-Thas the old White dragon Highlord.  Most of these show
the dark elf riding to battle over snow covered land upon his dragon mount
Sleet.  The walls are also decorated with fine armor from days long past. 
These are part of the shopkeeper's personal collection.

This dark building is constantly chill.  Even when the sunlight pours
through the stained windows the room never warms.  The windows are stained
with dark and disturbing patterns of death and decay.  When the light of the
sun or the moons hit these windows nightmarish patterns appear on the floor.
Set near the north wall of this dread room is a dark altar devoted to the
Dark Queen.  Idols of the lesser dark gods are arranged around the altar in
eternal homage to the statue of the Dark Warrior standing behind the altar. 
Near to the entrance of the church lie a set of stone steps leading upwards
to a guardhouse.

{wThe Guardhouse Above the Church{x~
This stone structure was built primarily as a dark church to the evil
gods.  However the breach in the wall leading directly into the White
Quarter necessitates at least an observation post.  A detachment of guards
from the white dragonarmy garrison this post keeping watch on the breach in
the wall.  From here they can spot anyone out of place crossing the boundary
from the outer city to the inner city.  Observation windows also line the
walls of this room allowing a watch to be set on most of the White Quarter. 
The main attention is fixed on the wall to the west and the way into the
inner city to the south.

the sound of raucous laughter and loud voices is ever stronger.  The guards
standing atop the mighty walls of the city around you seem to be keeping a
close eye on things in this part of the city.  Many a drunk soldier is
probably hauled out of here to The Pen in the Green Quarter.  The loudest
sounds of drunken merriment appear to be coming from a large inn to the
south.  Looking above the door you can see a wooden board with a finely
painted white lion on it.  To the east a building stands with the symbol of
warriors etched onto the doors.

This large tavern is surprisingly comfortable and clean.  The furniture
all appears to be in one piece though a few splinters lie on the floors here
and there.  The patrons all appear to be officers or higher ranked soldiers
in the white dragonarmy.  Spending their wages relaxing after a long duty
and discussing events with their fellow officers.  Several draconians sit
around the many tables drinking heavily and clawing at several serving girls
when they pass too close.  Every so often loud bursts of laughter can be
heard ringing about the place as one of the younger officers falls to the
floor losing yet another drinking contest with his older commander.

of the dark armies come to train.  The guildmaster will train all that enter
here not only those of the dark armies.  The room is full of large men
wrestling or practicing defensive and offensive fighting skills.  The
guildmaster walks among the men and women that are training here and gives
them instruction where neccessary.  Many warriors after their training can
be seen leaving and heading for The White Lion.  It seems no accident that
this guild is here.

You are in the White Quarter of the outer city.  The roads are very muddy
and are simply dirt avenues.  Sidewalks line the streets to keep those that
choose to walk here out of the horrible mud.  If it rains here the streets
become rivers of thick mud.  The wooden sidewalks are buckled from overuse
and wood rot but manage to keep people out of the mud.  Unless of course they
have to cross the street.  To the east lies the mighty city of Neraka.  A
large breach in the otherwise impenetratable walls allows access to the inner
city.  To the north and to the south the wooden walkways continue down the
muddy streets.  A large stone building bearing the insignia of the white
dragonarmy stands to the west.

{wA Guardhouse{x~
You are inside a sturdy stone building with small windows on all sides. 
This building appears to be purpose built to allow a large detachment of
guards to spend a whole duty shift watching the city around them. 
Occasionally guards will march out of here and patrol the streets bringing
back any untoward persons for interrogation.  Small holding cells can be
seen here to put these undesirables into before either being taken to the
pens for a term of imprisonment or to be taken before the armys commander
for further questioning.  Between the windows are the banners of the white
dragonarmy.  Each army is responsible for the well being of its own
quarter.  A door leads out into the white quarter to the east and stone
steps lead up to the next level of the guardhouse.

surrounding White Quarter of the city.  To the north and to the west the
White Quarter stretches out into the plains of Neraka.  The view to the east
is obviously the most watched since the stone around this observation area
appears more worn than the others.  The post looks out at the breach in the
city walls.  Any undesirables can be caught here before they can enter the

there arent the usual sounds of merriment.  The sign above the door shows

have something to do with the dark and evil looking building to the west.

the churches within the city.  The small altar dedicated to Takhisis has no
statue adorning it and there are no fine images of destruction or the
Queen's might.  This church serves the lowest warriors and soldiers of the
white dragonarmy.  The sense of evil power oozing from the altar and the
attendant clerics is no less powerful than the chill churches of the city. 
The Queen's presence is strong here among her foot soldiers.

the blood and other products of overdrinking.  The furniture lying around
the place is not in good repair but at least most of it is still in one
piece.  The numerous draconian soldiers and humans sit here quietly drinking
all sorts of foul highly potent drinks.  You suspect the reason for the
quiet and the lack of broken furniture here is largely due to the dark
clerics dragging away more than one rowdy patron into the dark church nearby
before the guards got there.

routed after the war they were reformed and regrouped here at Neraka. 
Although now one army the units are still separated by color.  A few

of sweeping conquests rather than old conquests from times forgotten.
