A deformed man with a foul smell stands here waiting to sell you a few things.
~
Standing here looking quite dumbfounded, stands a man whose arms, face and
legs all seem to be deformed in some way or another.  However, aside from
looking handicapped, he still looks light he has a fight or two left in him.
Looking at him sternly, you think twice and instead, check to see what he
has to sell.

A well-cloaked thief stands here, keeping a watchful eye over the Hall.
~
A dark cloak covers most of this thief's body.  A hood slightly pulled
over his head, leaves just enough opening to see his face.  A scarred face
and dark toned skin, gives him away as being one who's clashed with the law
more than once.  His narrow eyes reveal only a slight hint of color, that of
a green emerald.  Clasped to his belt, with his hand over the hilt, is an
extremely interesting looking dagger.

Taking one look at this fearsome looking dragon, brings you back to when
you were a child; listening to elders talk of hideous creatures that follow
the dark paths.  This dragon stands at least a good 70 to 80 paces high,
weighing too much to even guess.  Glimmering white scales cover every inch
of his skin.  Small icicles dangle off his whiskers.  You think twice as you
peer down and notice the razor sharp claws, covered in blood.

thick trees give you a sense of a more comfortable walk.  You notice

vines, lies a wooden sign with some writing etched on it.

abundance of boulders and thorny brush.  Perhaps a good place for an ambush.
Starting your climb up the rigorous path poses to be a little
breathtaking...  Literally.  Maybe you'd better head back north to the
safety of the city, or does great adventure lie waiting up ahead in the
cold, dark mountains...  Beckoning you to continue south.

though it was just recently written on, for a red substance seems to be
dripping off the bottom edge.  You step closer towards the sign to get a

of "nature" to your mind.

looks as if it had just rained.  There seems to be a little hole off to the
side which seems to have collected some of the precipitation, but after
taking a closer look, you decide that it would be best not to take a drink
let alone even wash your muddy boots off; for fear that they might melt
right off your feet.

two ways of direction seem to be east and west, but as far as which way goes
where, it's too hard to tell.  Looking around you can see birds soaring
freely, hopping from tree limb to tree limb, as well as a few other small
animals.  The fresh smell of the outdoors fills your lungs as you take a
deep breath and sigh at what you see around you.

You seem to be surrounded by thick brush as you push onward.  The
slithering of snakes can be heard near by making you wonder if continuing
south is such a good idea, or would heading back north be wiser.  Either
way, you figure you'd better not stand around for too long for fear that you
just might get tangled up in the heavy bushes, giving any kind of poisonous
creature the opportunity to take an advantage of the situation, making you
its prey.

erhaps the sign will give you a better understanding as to what lies behind
these two enormous doors which stand closed in front of you.  You could
however, go back north and go down the putrid smelling tunnel, back into the
fresh air, which seems to be the only good thing these mountains have had to
offer so far.

You stand before a small cliff deep in the mountains.  Looking up, you
can see a few small rocks tumbling down, headed in your direction of impact.
The rocks which form the cliff seem to be of a reddish color with a slight
goldish swirl.  As you ponder as to which direction to take, you look down
and see a small pile of rocks at your feet.  Almost looks like some sort of
game, played only by Kobolds.

A Narrow Path~
You find yourself walking down a narrow path, in between some fairly
large trees and a small rocky cliff.  Careful not to get in the path of any
falling rocks that may come tumbling down at any given moment, you start to
walk more closely along the side of the path in which the trees line down
on.

You come up to about the center of this cliff and take a look around. 
Not much can be seen through the thick darkness which seems to have over run
these mountains.  However, you can make out a small pile of rocks, a game
played by Kobolds perhaps, or just an old fire pit left by wandering
travelers.

of this red rock.  However, you notice another little trail leading south,
continuing on to another section of these rocky cliffs.

Here you find yourself standing before a small cliff.  Looking around, a
small pile of rocks can be seen scattered about the ground.  They don't look
like your average rocks, rather more smooth in texture, as if used for some
sort of purpose, a Game perhaps.  Looking up, you see a short, but tiring
climb up the small cliff.

Up in the Mountains~
Your vision gets a little cloudy as you seem to have stumbled upon a
section in the road which is covered by a light fog.  It doesn't seem to be
of a "natural" state, but rather that of the magical kind.  Perhaps a spell
or a curse has been cast upon it.  Then again, after what you've seen so far
in these mountains, you'd better not stop to think about it too much, for
weirdness seems to follow you everywhere you go.  That or youre following
it.

Looking up in a tree, you can here the sound of two birds chirping very
loudly and aggressively as if they are having a serious little quarrel. 
Aside from the two arguing birds, nothing else really seems to strike your
interest and you decide it would be best to continue on.

Up in the mountains you find yourself looking around, as if waiting for
the unexpected to come jump right out at you.  As you stop and listen
closely, you think you can a very distant growl of a panther, but what kind
of idiot would want to stop and go investigate to prove him or herself right
or wrong.  You can barely make out a bend in the trail if you head east. 
Scouting down the path to your west brings dissatisfaction, as your vision
can't seem to focus in quite clearly down that way.

You have come to a bend in the path which you travel.  Going south will
bring you around to the eastern side of the mountains and going west will
bring you to the front side.  This part of the area seems to be a little
less green, as the tall trees and overgrown weeds no longer dominate the
sides of the road.

You have now reached the eastern side of the, fairly large, Garnet
Mountains.  It looks in no way, a whole lot different than the rest of the
mountains, except maybe a few less trees.  However, now instead of the tall
trees, there seems to be an increase in the amount of sharp rocks and large
boulders lying about.

Coming up to what looks like a dead end, going north or climbing up the
small rock cliff which blocks your way from going any further north, seems
to be your only two options.  Trying to climb over the boulders to go west
would only bring your death and wouldn't make much of any sense.  Then going
east, well, there is no possible way to climb up those rocks.

Standing up on top of a small rocky cliff, the air seems to be getting
thinner or thicker depending on which way youre traveling.  You could travel
down the little cliff, or go west and try your adventurous ambition. 
Looking down however, you start to notice that the path has a few weeds
sprouting out from the center of it.

block out any light from the skies, which probably would make travel a
little easier.

A Path on the Mountainside~
Standing at an odd intersection in the mountains, you notice a smooth
rocky path leading down.  What could be hibernating down there?  Going up
the, fairly non-well traveled path also seems a little strange, for there
actually seems to be some kind of light poking through the trees.  Of course
whether it is light from the sun, or light from the moons, you have yet to
tell.  Then going east, shows to lead to a better traveled trail, for there
seems to be less weeds protruding from the middle of the path, unlike where
you stand now, where they seem to grasp at your feet.

Down the Side of the Mountains~
Down on the smooth rock path you stand.  The path seems to have been made
by something of an animal type.  Youre not sure, but you could swear there's
large paw prints still imbedded in the now hardened mud, on the sides of the
path.  Theyve gone through so much weathering, it's hard to tell; after all
they could just be nothing.  Then again, up in any mountain range, you never
can be well prepared for what lies around each and every corner.

fairly large, possibly enormous cave.  Now you know for sure that the paw
prints in the mud south of here are in fact, animal in nature.  Going west
could only prove your curiosity and thoughts either right or wrong.  Then
again, leaving south seems to be a better, more warming gut feeling.

You have entered a small cave.  Judging by the small bed of hay, and the
large amount of bones scattered about the area, this cave is probably still
being used by someone or something.  The scent of blood and dead animal fill
your nostrils, making you feel a bit queasy.  Perhaps it would be best to
turn around and leave this foul smelling cave to its occupants.

Up in the deep terrain of the Mountains, you notice that some sort of
light peeks through the trees, as if here the trees aren't powerful enough
to block it entirely out.  The source of the light is still too hard to make
out.  For all you know, being that most of this mountain seems to be dark,
it could be night 'round the clock, and you'd never be able to tell the
difference.  Going in either direction still proves to be just as dark and
even darker going down.

Birds soar back and forth between trees, as well as bats.  Tall trees still
loom over you blocking out any light which tries to penetrate through,
making it very difficult to get a clear visual of your surroundings.

bushes and some wild flowers.

placement, you feel pretty confident in continuing on.

as you continue forth.  Little insects scurry about, trying to stay clear of
your path as you walk by.  Just the thought of bats flying near your head is
enough to boggle your mind, let alone having to see them actually do it. 
Perhaps it would be best to continue on your way, rather then take the
chance of being hit in the head by one of those venomous creatures.

break loose and tumble down the cliff.  Looking down more closely, you
notice that there seems to be some kind of hole in the side of the cliff.  A
secret cave perhaps?  Only one way to find out be brave enough to climb
down.

You have come to the beginning and end of the Trail of Tears.  Why it was
named that, you're unclear, but perhaps if you went up it you'd find out. 
It seems to be a little quieter than normal, bats not winging your head as
you walk by like they normally do.  Looking up, you can see a very steep
climb.  Just looking up and thinking about climbing it almost seems painful.

Looking down, the darkness seems to cover the mountain road, like a
plague.  Looking up you can start to make out the sky.  The trees are bent,
to slope upward with the rocky, cliff like path.  From up above, fresh air
seeps down and into your lungs.  However, if you go up, you can feel the air
starting to get really cold, and fast.

watch your step carefully, you could slip and fall turning yourself into a
mortal sled.  Although the air is cold, something doesn't smell right.  You
can't place your finger on it, but it almost smells something like a Kobold
or Mimic of some sort.

leaving one square inch of open ground.  The tree's limbs hang low by the
weight of the snow and as you start walking, you realize that it's at least
three feet deep.

hands and feet.

Up an Icy Trail~
You find yourself at the top of an icy trail.  Looking down, you can see
the vicious snowy path.  Up here, you seem to be able to focus in your eyes
a little better, with the wind and flying debris being considerably less
than what it was down there.  However, although you may be able to see more
clearly, your ability to walk with good footing just went out the door.

Although your vision up here is much clearer than it was down there, it's a

continue down this frozen path, or go back down to the, not-so-nice winds of

but not like the kind youre used to seeing.  These stand out quite
different, and make you wonder what else lurks up here with you.  Better

completing your journey up here; however you also can make out something
moving.  Youre too far away to get a good, clear look, but you can tell
there definitely is something up there.  Perhaps, you should go up and take
a gander; after all, coming all this way only to head back down would be
cowardly.

The chilling wind stings your face with its rigid cold air, as you have
taken your last step through the, now, deep snow to make it up Garnet's
Peak.  Trying to catch your breath from the long hike and thin air, you stop
to take a look around.  Looking north, the city of Solanthus looks like a
small model.  Looking to your east, you can make out the outline of another
city.  Could it be the city of Lemish?  Turning around you can make out
another city.  Must be the fabled city of Kaolyn you've always heard about
since you were a child.  Looking around close by, it looks as if the snow
itself is moving.  Is it just your imagination, or is there something up
here with you?

women in excruciating pain.  A fairly large painting depicting a world in
chaos, hangs on the wall.  Getting a closer look, it almost looks like the
world is that of Krynn.  However, age seems to have taken its toll on the

unexpected happens.  Before you leave, you notice that on some of the

fountain made of gold spurts out water, enough to quench even the thirstiest
of Dragons.

On the Side of the Mountains~
Small brush and large, sharp rocks look blurry as you whisk by them
traveling down this mountain road.  The faint sounds of birds chirping and
other wild creatures playing around in the bushes further up the mountains
fill your ears delightfully.  You may continue with your adventure by either
heading north or south of here, however the impossible steep climb up or
down, prevent you from trying to go east or west.

A Rocky Bend in the Path~
Another corner in the mountains, yet this one seems to hold an abundance
of sharp rocks lining the sides of the road.  Watch out though, not being
careful enough could land you over the side and down the mountains, plunging
to your death.

Down a rocky path you go.  Not much for vegetation grows here, only sharp
rocks seem to guild you further down the road.  Looking east, you see
something in the distance, perhaps someone in trouble.  Then looking west,
you see more sharp rocks curving around a corner.

A Rocky Bend in the Path~
Coming up to a tight corner in the road, covered with large, sharp rocks,
you can see some poor fellow lost control of his wagon and smashed it up
against some rocks.  Perhaps you should look inside to see if there are any
survivors.  Maybe someone's bleeding to death and can't call for help.  Or
you could shrug and take off like the one-way bastard you are and let them
perish in the wreckage.

A Clear Cut Corner~
You come up to a corner which has been cleared of all its obstructions in
the road.  A little tree frog hops across the road, trying to stay clear of
your path.  Looking down you can see many little bugs skittering about, all
seeming to have a place or home to go to.  The sounds of birds chirping can
be heard as you continue on.

Coming up to yet another corner, you can relax a little as you see that
it's a clear, smooth shot going around.  A slight wind blows the leaves
dangling from the trees, giving it a rainbow affect.  Taking a breath of the
clean, fresh mountain air as you continue on your way, you stumble over a
rock.  Hey now, where'd that come from?

trees' leaves and small animals scurry about looking for food.  The path

This corner seems to go around at a nice, smooth bend.  Any speed could
probably be taken, within reason, and total loss of control would probably
not be a factor.  The only thing that may prove to be a little painful are
the tall trees which grow fairly close, almost right next to the road.

growing among a few other beautiful flowers.  Trees grow well spaced apart
from each other, although they still tower way up above.

flying around the corner in a horse drawn carriage, or one of those Gnome
vehicle inventions, they'd easily loose their ground and go tumbling down

way, caution should be taken just in case.  Looking into the brush, you can
make out the faint image of a small little stream.  Where it heads to can
not be told.  Not much else different from what you have already been

purposely widened and going north will bring you down a well traveled trail.
To your east, you can get a good look down the rugged and steep mountain. 
With so many obstacles, it's next to impossible to see the bottom.

and continues to do so the further you go.  It almost looks as if it had
been initially widened to lead a herd of animals down here.  Brush has been
cleared and laid down on the sides of the trail making it a little less
harsh to travel upon.

The brush and tall grass growing on the sides of this path have also been
either cleared or beaten down into the ground, making it easier to walk on. 
Looking west, you can start to make out some sort of light, but from way
back here it's too hard to tell.  The sounds of men chatting and laughing
loudly can be heard.  Perhaps there is some sort of normalcy way up here in
the mountains, but then again, it could be a trap.

You can smell a faint odor of burning wood and roasted rabbit.  The
pleasant smell seems to be coming from the west of you and gets stronger the
further you head in that direction.  The path leading to there also seems to
be a lot wider than most you've traveled already and judging by the multiple
tracks in the ground, you'd think there was a heard of animals that passed
through this way.

A Shepherd's Campsite~
The smell of burning wood fills the air from the somewhat large burning
campfire.  A handful of shepherds sit around taking a long needed rest from
their hike.  A large wooden log appears to have been pulled up the mountain
for people to rest upon, while a huge moss covered boulder add's a
decorative and pleasant feeling to the area.  There is plenty of room around
the fire for all to sit, while the log only holds a handful of people.

food in the bushes start to fade out if you go south and get louder if you
head north.  This trail seems a bit too narrow for someone of your size, but
rather a good size for a deer or a boar to walk on.

small, but noticeable scratches.  Looking down the mountain to your south,
you can barely make out the outline of another city.  Could it be Lemish, or
just an illusion brought on by the exhaustion of fighting through these
thick thorny bushes?

worse.  Looking into the thick bushes more closely, you also notice a small
sign, and what looks like to be a small cave entrance behind them.

which seem to grow by the numbers in these parts.  About the only odd thing
is there are neither roses nor any rose buds for that matter growing at the
ends of the brush.  Weird, because you were always taught that where there's
thorns, there's roses.

carrying on in a deep conversation, not even acknowledging your presence. 
Perhaps it'd behoove of you to grab yourself a tray and get something to eat
also.

A Crowded Lobby~
You've entered a lobby, which seems to be heavily crowded, almost too
crowded for you to move around much.  Good thing it isn't Kender which fill
this room, else you'd probably walk out naked by the time you got to the
other side.  Looking around, you can't seem to find an open seat and looking
north, you see a small desk with a little bell on it and a small sign that
reads "Foreman's Office" on it.

The Foreman's Office~
Alas, you've made your way into the foreman's office alive.  He looks
very busy, and pretty pissed at the fact that youre standing here
distracting him from his work.  Standing next to him writing down notes on a
piece of paper, is some sort of scribe, or perhaps a personal guard of the
Foreman who's just jotting down their plans.  Perhaps it would be best to
leave quietly, before you REALLY piss them off.

{RThieves Training Room {W#1{x~
Welcome to training!  This room is used for training purposes only.  In
the middle of the room sits a straw dummy.  Practice your backstabbing and
weapons on it, thats what it's there for.  After you feel confident enough
in your weapons skills, step into the shadows and you shall return to the
beginning.

{RThieves Training Room {W#2{x~
Here you find yourself in the second room of training.  There is an
anti-theft dummy in the middle.  Practice your stealing skill by trying to
steal the whip from its inventory.  Once you feel youre finished, go ahead
and step in to the shadows.

{RA Closet of Surprises{x~
Youre standing in a small tight closet.  The walls are as smooth as glass
and have no shelves on them.  A small lamp hangs overhead swaying slightly
from an unknown breeze or movement.  There appears to be nothing special or
surprising about this closet.

{RA Room of Comfort{x~
This is a comforting room.  A soft glow seems to come from overhead
though the source cannot be seen.  A few small plush chairs are scattered
about the room, while a small table sits near the middle of the room.  A
swirling shadow hangs near a wall.  Wonder what it could be...

Kougyoku's Study~
Tapestries line the walls of the spacious study, intricate designs woven
into their rich fabrics, they dance against the wall as a slight breeze
drifts through the room.  Sentinel-like bookcases stand guard between the
tapestries, each shelf covered in a wide selection of tomes; a multitude of
texts gathered from about Krynn.  Set before the bookcases is a large desk,
an open book upon the dark, wooden surface, a single candle burning before
it.  The ceiling rises upward, hidden within the depths of shadow, their
true height unknown.  Elven-crafted furniture rests about the room, a few
comfortable chairs rest before a large fireplace, the light of the flames
embracing them with warmth.  Beneath an imposing, circular window stands a
large bed, draped with silks of dark colors, they glisten in the light cast
by the dancing flames of the torches that are set throughtout the marble
walls.  The marble flooring is of the best dwarven craftsmanship, decorated
with the intricate geometric design of dwarven stoneworkers.  It stretches
about a large glistening star-diamond set into the center, engraved with the
name Kougyoku Gentou.
