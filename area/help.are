The entire staff of the MUD: The Turning Point
- A lot of concepts/ideas have come from that MUD and have been programmed here.
  Sorry to hear it's been shut down, and hope those who played over there can find
  this place worthy of being called their new home.
 
Programmers for the Legends of Krynn and it's source code LoK1.1:

Many thanks go out to ALL of the staff members here at The Legends of Krynn who
have come and go, leaving a piece of their history behind, whether it be Areas
they built, or many hours of Roleplay and Newbie Helping they have contributed.

-1 NEWBIE INFO~
Ah!  Another mortal, seeking adventure.  You should go through mudschool
first, to gain experience to face the trials outside.  Be sure to practice a
weapon in the guild room, or your stay with us shall be very short indeed. 
Type 'equipment' to see what your are wielding, 'spells' to see your spells,
'skills' to see your skills, and 'commands' for a list of commands.  Help is
available on most commands and abilities.  
 
This is a roleplaying mud that does allow playerkilling, but
requires roleplaying reasons to do so.  If you are interested in
roleplaying, you are welcome here.  If you are only interested in
powergaming and playerkilling, try a different mud.
 
A note for newbies who have never played a MUD before:
Greater and less than signs (<>) have been used above to set apart the
commands and your personalized input from the explanations of them.  The
shorthand <text> is used for a line of text of your choosing.
 
Everything inside the quotation marks ("")denotes exactly what you need
to type for any given command.
 
Please type 'help rules' to see the Rules of this MUD.

-1 STEEL GOLD MONEY~
Krynn's economy is based mostly on Steel and Gold pieces.  There are many
other lower type of money, such as copper and silver, however we only use
the 2 types highest on the monetary scale, as not to confuse the hell out of
players with 30 different types.  1 steel piece is worth 100 gold pieces. 
Gold can be converted to steel and vice versa at any bank on Krynn.  
~

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour    Toggles colour mode on/off

        You may also talk in colour; the format is like this:
	the 'escape character' to specify a colour is the left
	handed brace '{{', following 
	that you should use one of the following letters,
		{r{{r     red     {c{{c     cyan
		{g{{g     green   {y{{y     yellow
		{b{{b     blue    {w{{w     white
		{m{{m     magenta {x{{x     clear(reset colour)
		{{{{      {{ char {{*       beep
		{{/       newline
	when using colour, it looks better if you finish the line
	with whatever colour it would normally be in, such as a
	gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
	looks better than:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

	ColoUr is written by Lope (ant@solace.mh.se)

~

0 COLOUR2 COLOR2 ANSI2~
Syntax: colour <field> <colour>

        You may configure your colour setting for personal preference.
        current setting are indicated by colour.

        fields are:
        {ttext         {aauction      {dgossip       {emusic        {qquestion
        {fanswer       {hclass_text   {Hclass_name   {iimmtalk_text {Iimmtalk_type
        {jinfo         {ktell         {lreply        {ngtell_text   {Ngtell_type
        {Zwiznet       {sroom_title   {Sroom_text    {oroom_exits   {Oroom_things
        {pprompt       {1fight_death  {2fight_yhit   {3fight_ohit   {4fight_thit
        {5fight_skill{x

        colours are: ( Hi- )
        {rred          {ggreen        {bblue         {yyellow       {mmagenta
        {ccyan         {wwhite{x

eg. to make the gossip channel red type 'colour gossip red'
    to make your hits in fights magenta type 'colour fight_yhit magenta'
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
THIS COMMAND IS RESTRICTED TO PLAYERS LEVEL 10 and UP!!

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being
bombarded by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see
'help reply') to reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf,
although you cannot reply to a deaf person, unless they are a diety (it's
mostly useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message
to a person).
 
Note: You can not use the TELL command while in DEAF mode.
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
Syntax: prompt show
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.

PROMPT SHOW will show you what your current PROMPT is already set to.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current mana
        %M :  Display your maximum mana
        %v :  Display your current moves
        %V :  Display your maximum moves
{x        %b :  Displays a graphical health bar of your enemy
{x        %B :  Displays your enemy's health in percentage
        %x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level
{x        %g : Display your steel held
{x        %s : Display your gold carried
        %a :  Display your alignment
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
{x         %D :   Display name (useful for when switched) (IMMORTAL ONLY)
{x         %w :  Display your incog level (IMMORTAL ONLY)
{x         %W :  Display your wizi level (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
 
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"

1 DEATH~
When your character dies, your spirit rises from your body and hovers
over your corpse.  A new body will be rushed to you as soon as one can be
assigned.  In the meantime, since you have no physical presence, you can't
do much.  You can see what goes on in the room, but you can't do anything
about it.  When your new body arrives, you will be reincarnated in the same
room where you died.  You may then get your stuff back from your corpse,
that is if others haven't gotten there first.  Your new body will be
temporarily invulnerable and will have enough sight to get your stuff even
in a darkened room.  You may then recall to begin healing if you like.  You
do lose experience when you are killed by a mobile, approximately one half
level's worth.  When you are killed by another player, your experience is
unaffected, but your equipment will likely not be so lucky!  
~

1 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need so much
experience per level based on your race and your class, and also your level.
As you gain in levels so does your experience per level gain.
{x
You gain experience by: being part of a group that kills a monster
{x                        being rewarded for excellent roleplaying
{x                        per-tick experience
{x                        improving skills (minor gains only)
{x
You lose experience by: fleeing from a battle 
{x                        dying by the hands of a mob
{x
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:
- how many players are in your group;
- your level versus the level of the monster;
- your alignment versus the monster's alignment.
{x
Experience for roleplaying depends on the situation.  Always make a
point of displaying your best roleplaying abilities.  Immortals will
often reward excellent roleplayers when a player least expects it.
Per-Tick Experience is awarded to ALL Classes, but more for Blacksmiths. This
feature allows people who prefer to play a class that does not participate
in combat, the chance to gain Experience Points.  The gains will begin
after the player has been logged in for a particular amount of time, and
then will continue every tick there after. This experience is not as
effective as combat experience, but is intended to allow players to have
characters with pacifistic characters if they so choose.  Do *not* abuse
this feature.  It is intended to reward and make possible certain character
concepts.  Remaining idle for prolonged periods of time using triggers and
such in order to abuse this feature is unacceptable.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~

0 WEDGE PRY~
Allow you to wedge a door closed or pry open a locked or wedged door.

Syntax: Wedge <Dir>
        Pry   <Dir>
~

0 BEEP~
Allow you to send a series of beeps to a character.

Syntax: Beep  <Player>
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
{x        c <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

102 EXIT~
For exits, type the direction (north/s/e/w) followed by:

dig <vnum>         - creates the room and makes a two way link
link <room vnum>   - make a two way link
room <room vnum>   - make a one way link (use with caution)
key <object vnum>  - makes specified object the vnum of the key required
name <door name>   - makes the door's name/keywords = to the given name
desc               - edit the description of the exit
delete             - delete this exit
<exit-flags>       - type ? EXIT for a list(make exit door, locked etc.)

The exit flags are presented in the following manner.  The capitalized
flags are ones not included in the reset info.  i.e. closed is due to
a player closing the door and not due to the door being set to be closed.

-South to [ 3744] Key: [   -1] Exit flags: [door CLOSED bashed pickproof]
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into). The best thing to do
is to read EVERY Room description. For a lot of times, that's where most
of your clues will be as to whether or not there's a hidden exit somewhere.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 'GTELL' 'REPLY' 'SAY' 'TELL'~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

Note on TELL, GTELL, and REPLY: All these channels are considered OOC channels.
SAY, however, is considered IC, unless expressly noted otherwise.
~

0 NOTE NOTES CHANGES STORY PENALTY IDEA UNREAD~
The NOTES here on Legends, replace bulletin boards and mail systems found
on other MUDS. The following options are usable, but keep in mind that
this example only uses NOTES, for other types of messages, such as Changes,
Ideas and Story, simply substitute the 'note' for them.

UNREAD will show which type of board you have unread messages in and will
also show you how many in that category are unread.

reading notes:
note list	: show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read	: either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove	: removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
note catchup	: markes all notes as read

writing new notes:
note to		: sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
note subject	: sets the subject for a new note
note edit       : enters online editor
note clear	: erase a note in progress
note show	: shows the note you are working on
note post	: posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

note forward # <person> : Forwards note # to the specified person, or group,
such as Immortal, Imp, or any clan.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Four other directories exist, these are ideas, story, changes and
penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example
idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is
restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools.
 
~

0 YELL~
Syntax: yell    <message>

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.
~

0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

1 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE can be used to remove 1 item from your inventory, or you may type
REMOVE ALL, to remove everything in your inventory all at once.
~

103 SMITE RETRIBUTION~
Here's how it works:
   Immortals use "retribution" to create a message of what the players see
   when they are smited, it works the same way description does. To smite
   someone, you type: smite <victim> <hp> <mana> <move> <position>
   <equipment> Where <victim> is the person to be smited, <hp> <mana> and
   <move> are the percentages from 1 - 95 of how much damage you want to
   do to the player. Position is what position you want to set the victim
   to, currently only "stun", "sleep", "rest", "sit", and "stand" are
   allowed, "dead", "mortal", "incap", and "fight" are just there so the
   system works correctly. Finally, equipment is one piece of equipment
   you want to knock off from the player.
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.
~

0 AREAS COMMANDS REPORT SCORE TIME~
Syntax: areas
Syntax: commands
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

AREAS    - shows you a list of areas in the game.

COMMANDS - shows you all the commands in the game.

REPORT   - Can only be used by Immortals to report hp/mana/move

SCORE    - shows much more detailed statistics to you only. Your ability
{x           scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
{x           Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a
{x           23 strength from other factors (spells or items).

TIME     - shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started

WEATHER  - shows the current game weather.
~

-1 WHO~
Syntax: who

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO list, such as people HIDDEN
or INVIS that are above your level when you have DETECT HIDDEN or DETECT INVIS
on. Immortals who are WIZINVIS can only be seen by other Immortals who are
at least the same level or higher than the WIZI level they are set at.
~

-1 WHOIS~
Syntax: whois <name>
The whois command identifies any user who matches the name given. For
example, 'whois a' shows all characters whose name begins with A.
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

1 DESCRIPTION DESC~
Syntax: description
Syntax: description edit
Syntax: description format

Typing DESCRIPTION, with NO argument, or ANY argument NOT listed in the
above SYNTAX, will simply show you what your current description is.

Typing DESCRIPTION EDIT will enter you into an editor. This editor is
similar to the one you write notes in. You can write your entire
description in here with ease. To see the list of usable commands while
inside the editor, on a NEW line (Hit Return to put yourself on a new
line, if the line your on has any text on it), type    .h
and then hit RETURN.

You MUST include the PERIOD before the letter H, otherwise you'll just
enter in the letter H on your new line. Always remember, each command
you type, must ALWAYS be on a new line, otherwise it will just add what
you type, to the rest of the text on your line. For example, once you
have finished writing your description, on a NEW line, you can type .f
(then hit return), and your description will be formatted. After
each command, you will always be placed on a NEW line, so after you've
formatted your description, you will already be on a new line, and don't
need to hit return again. Then you would type: @ (and then hit return)
to exit the description editor. If you feel uncomfortable using this
editor, you can alays write up your description another way, as
described below.
 
DESCRIPTION FORMAT will wrap your description text, making it look pretty
and more professional and presentable, not to mention, legible.
 
Again, it is highly recommended that you learn how to use the description
editor. Writing descriptions using that editor can make things a lot
easier.
 
Your description is the first impression that you make on others. It is
how you appear to the outside world.  It is what people see when they
look at you (other than your condition and your equipment list).  Your
description is one of the foundations of your roleplaying. Through it, you
can get across to others many things about your character, before you even
say a word.
 
Your description is comprised of the text above the line indicating your
condition.  You must write a description by level 10, though it is
advisable to write one as soon as possible.  The process of writing a
description helps decide the characters' history.
 
When you create a character, the character begins young. For humans the
age is seventeen years old.  All other races begin at the equivalent age
for their race. At the very least, know what the character looks like and
have a rough idea of the character's background before beginning to
adventure. Remember, as the character grows and changes, you can change or
add to your character's description.
 
There are many types of descriptions.  The purely physical attributes
should be referred to in a good description (height, weight, build,
hair/eye/skin color, complexion etc).  They can include certain
characteristics of your character (a limp, a scar, a particular way of
moving, an aura of good/evil/power, etc).
 
The best descriptions combine all of these aspects by being mainly
physical, but describing the various physical aspects in ways that reveal
some of the character's underlying background, motivations, etc.
Multi-line descriptions are required, as you cannot possibly be
descriptive enough in just one line.  The syntax above should allow you to
easily write your description.
 
Descriptions should and need to be written in the 3'rd person, not first or
second, as you are not telling a personal story of your adventures.
 
A good example would be:
A silver-haired drow of very slight build is here.  He has dark,
unblemished skin that has never seen the harsh conditions of the upper
world's weather.  His pale white hair is streaked with a glistening silver
and is held back in one long sleek braid.  He wears no sword, but the
loose folds of his garments could easily have small daggers stashed away
from normal view.  A tattoo on his shoulder is a red spider with a
sinister black diamond on the body.  His golden eyes gleam brightly and
frequently search the area.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

0 TITLE~
The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you 
advance a level. The only way you may have your very own "special"
re-strung title, is if you prove yourself in Roleplay, that you earn it.
For example, if you wanted the title 'The Nightslayer of Palanthas', for
roleplay, we'd want to see something like, night after night you run into
the city and commit serious murders. Something to that effect. And it would
have to be something you roleplay constantly. Don't think you'll be able to
get away with acting some way one time and then beg or demand an Immortal
to give you a title. We watch everyone's roleplay and when/if an Immortal
notices that you Roleplay in that particular manner constantly, then you
shall be approached and the Immortal will give you suggestion. If you do
not like the suggestion for the title, you may then come up with your own,
however, it must be something related to your Roleplay and the Immortal's
first suggestion. If you Roleplay a Nightslayer of Palanthas, and the Imm
suggests the above mention title, but you don't like it, come up with 
something else, but something along those lines, not something out of whack
like 'The Master Dark Mage of Krynn'.
 
One other thing, although that is generally the only way to receive a title,
there is one other method, and that is becoming a Leader of a Clan. It will,
however, be a title dealing with your Clan.
 
Also, those players who reach HERO status (level 101) will get to use this
command at any time, provided an Immortal has removed their NOTITLE status
first.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

- For those using the LOCK SPELL -
Syntax: cast 'lock' <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.
** Note:  If opening a DOOR, remember to type the DIRECTION, not the word
{x          DOOR itself.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.
 
And for the SPELL called LOCK, it will do the same as the LOCK command, only
you are casting a spell, instead of physically doing it, and your NOT required
to have a KEY, like you would if you were to lock something physically with
the command.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> out
Syntax: pour  <object> <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> <character>

You will not experience the effects of Hunger or Thirst as a Newbie. Once
you reach level 6, that is when you will begin to experience hunger and
thirst. Watch your screen carefully, as you will be warned when you begin
to feel hungry and/or thirsty. If you let it go for too long, you WILL begin
to lose Hit Points and eventually die when your HP runs down to 0.
Starvation and Dehydration will kill you here. You will be warned when you
begin to die from either of the two. So make sure you keep plenty of water
and food with you.
 
When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.

POUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.
You can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the GOD whom you worship, rewarding you with
gold. The amount of the reward depends upon the type of object your
sacrificing. SAC ALL may be used to sacrifice everything in the room
thats lying on the ground all at once.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP GROUPING~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

Grouping will only beneficial for experience points, if you group with players
within 10 levels of your own. A group of 2 will always gain more XP than one
would by him or herself. A group of 3 people will gain even more XP per kill
than both of those instances. Mobs do not get included in the deciding factor
as to how many experience points each person receieve. The group could have
15 charmies, but if it has only 3 players, you'll still be within that 3
person limit and will still gain a great amount of experience points.
A group of 4 or more Players, or a group with someone Outside of the 6 level
plus or minus range, will result in everyone in the group, only recieving
1 experience point per kill, no matter what your group kills.
 
Groups also have 3 different fighting positions, just like on the game,
Final Fantasy. There is a Front, Middle and Rear position. The person in
the Front, will recieve the most damage, but will also get in the most hits
which means if he/she is good, will deal the most damage. The person in the
Middle position, will recieve roughly only half of the damage (gets hit only
half the time), but will not get in as many hits as the person in the Front
will. The person in the Rear position, will not be hit at all by the Mob,
unless the Mob can cast AREA spells, in which case, will hit everyone. The
Rear position will not allow the player to physically hit the Mob, but will
allow most spells to be cast, which WILL hit the Mob. The Rear position is
usually best for Mages, where they can cast their spells and not worry about
getting beat up to easily. The Rear position is also good for those who need
to rest for a few, but not have to flee the scene. To move about in a group,
see 'help advance' and 'help backward'. Also see 'help battle tactics'.
 
If fighting a large group of Monsters, it is possible for them to advance and
attack someone in the Rear position, which in turn will place them in the
middle or front position, and they will uncontrollably be tanking.
(see 'help tanking' for a better explanation of what that is).
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

Also, there are QUIT TIMERS in this game. It is a timer that automatically
sets itself to a certain number whenever you get into a fight. The number
sets higher when you attack another player, as to give the player a
small chance to claim his/her revenge. The quit timer can only be seen by
Immortals. You can NOT quit with this timer on. You must wait it out. No
Immortal will ever tell you what your quit timer is set at, so don't ask.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

1 RECALL /~
Syntax: recall
{x        /

RECALL will send you back to your hometown.  After level 11, recall can
only be used by those with the 'word of recall' spell, or those who can
recite scrolls and happen to recite a scroll of recall.  RECALL costs half
of your movement points and will NOT work in certain god-forsaken rooms. 
Characters affected by a CURSE will also not be able to recall.  If you
RECALL during combat, you WILL lose experience points (more than you would
for fleeing) and there is a greater chance of failing than there is from
fleeing.  The chance is based on your recall skill, although even at 100%,
RECALL does not ensure success, so don't waste your practices on the skill. 
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coin <character>
{x        STEAL gold <character>
{x        STEAL steel <character>
{x        STEAL coins <character>
{x        STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.
Beware, stealing from other players can earn you a Theft flag if
your caught and convicted by a Solamnic Knight.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
If a spell or skill has an N/A displayed next to it, that means the spell
is not yet available to you, your not that level yet, hence it is not
usable or practicable until you reach that level.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10. You recieve only one (1) session per every 5 levels.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

102 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

102 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

102 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

102 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 102), except for link-dead players
who are returning. Newlock only locks out new character generation,
typically used for preventing a spammer from returning. Wizlocking should be
avoided if at all possible, and newlocking should be accomponied by mail
or a note to the Imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

102 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

102 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

102 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

102 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

102 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

102 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

102 STRING~
Syntax:
{x  string char <name> <field> <string>
{x    fields: name short long desc title spec racetext
{x  string obj  <name> <field> <string>
{x    fields: name short long extended

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

102 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

There are no open public channels here at Legends of Krynn, nor is shouting
a channel anymore. They already have YELL, no need to have a SHOUT command
too. So, there really is no point in using the NOCHANNEL or NOSHOUT commands.
 
The NOEMOTE and NOTELL commands are still pretty effective, but unless the
person is harrasing another player constantly and out of Roleplay, there is
no real need to ever use them.
~

1 PARDON~
Syntax: Pardon <character> <killer|thief|assault|treason|outlaw>
 
Pardon dismisses the charges (the flag they have) from a player. Pardoning
someone should be used ONLY if they deserve it and/or can be found innocent.
Keep in mind, with Solamnics being the only ones who can CHARGE and PARDON
a person, pardoning someone who was charged by someone else, means that your
overruling their decision, which could cause hate, discontent and chaos
among the Clan. Another valid reason to dismiss someone is if the accuser
who wanted charges to be brought up, decides to change his or her mind
and wants to have them dismissed. Or, if a person serves a sentence in
jail or is administered some other form of punishment, then they can be
dismissed as well.
~

102 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

102 PLOAD PUNLOAD~
Syntax: PLOAD <character's name>
{x        PUNLOAD <character's name>

Use pload to load characters into the current location.
Use punload for sending the characters back into reality. 
Characters are loaded into a link dead (LD) state.
You cannot pload or punload characters that are currently in the game.
~

102 for~
FOR ALL <action>
FOR MORTALS <action>
FOR GODS <action>
FOR <level> <action>
FOR MOBS <action>
FOR EVERYWHERE <action>

Executes action several times, either on 

ALL players (not including yourself),

MORTALS (including trusted characters), 

GODS (characters with level higher than 102), 

<LEVEL> those who are AT or ABOVE the level you specify (can not enter
{x        a value below 1, nor exceed level 110)

MOBS (NEVER USE) or 

every room (NEVER USE EITHER!)

If you insert a # in the action, it will be replaced by the name of the
target.
If # is a part of the action, the action will be executed for every target
in game. If there is no #, the action will be executed for every room
containg
at least one target, but only once per room. # cannot be used with FOR
EVERY-
WHERE. # can be anywhere in the action.
Example: 
FOR ALL SMILE -> you will only smile once in a room with 2 players.
FOR ALL TWIDDLE # -> In a room with A and B, you will twiddle A then B.
[Hit Return to continue]
Destroying the characters this command acts upon MAY cause it to fail. Try
to
avoid something like FOR MOBS PURGE (although it actually works at my
MUD).
FOR MOBS TRANS 3054 (transfer ALL the mobs to Midgaard temple) does NOT
work
though :)
The command works by transporting the character to each of the rooms with 
target in them. Private rooms are not violated.
~

102 ADDAPPLY~
Syntax ADDAPPLY [Apply Type] [Apply] [Time] [Bitvector]

For permanent time, set time to zero (0)

Valid apply types are:
affects            object             immune             resist

1 LISTCLAN CLAN~
Syntax: clan <text>

This command can be used to communicate to other clan members. Each clan
has it's own special method of communicating. Be aware that there is a
time delay from the time you finish writing what you want to say and hit
return, to the time people in your clan recieve the message. Another
command you may use is MESSAGE, see 'help message', to relay clantells.

Note: For those who are in the Solamnic, KoT and Mercenary Clans,
{x      You are required to use your Backup command in order to get those
{x      mobs into the same room as you first, in order to use the clan
{x      channel. The mobs that are summoned using the Backup command,
{x      do NOT neccissarily need to be following you. As long as they
{x      are in the same room, your good to go.

There are many clans on the Legends of Krynn.
For specific help on each clan seek out a (leader)
or (recruiter) of that clan.

**Conclave**           **Mercenary**
 
**Holy Order**         **Thieves**

102 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character. It also heals poison, plague and blindness. It will
also restore their Conditions to full ( hunger, thirst and full ).

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

102 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

102 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

102 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

102 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo, pecho, or gecho. So, it is pointless to use any of these
commands to an Immortal higher than you, as the full affects of these commands
will be ruined when they see a log echo> 'message'. It looks better to just
SAY it.
~

102 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

102 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

102 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~

52 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

102 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

102 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

102 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere
{x        mwhere <name>

Mwhere typed with no argument, will show you what room every player in the
game is in. Mwhere with an argument, will show you the exact location of that
person, or if the name of a Mob is used, it will show you every room that
every Mob which matches the argument is in.
~

102 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

102 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

102 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

102 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

102 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

102 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

102 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~

101 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
 
Some commands are given at Hero status (level 101)

target character by 1 for every 8 levels of the caster. It may also be

Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.

        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

0 CONCLAVE~
Of all the orders of Ansalon, none are as feared or as respected as the
Orders of High Sorcery.  Throughout history, the Wizards of High Sorcery
have been considered by the rest of the populace as either a bastion of
strength or an abomination that needed to be destroyed.  The Orders of High
Sorcery are comprised of three distinct groups: the {WWhite{x Robes of Good,
the {RRed{x Robes of Neutrality, and the {DBlack{x Robes of Evil.  Divided
by alignment, they are bound together by one ideal - a wizard's only loyalty
is to magic.  
 
When the three gods of magic first formed the orders, wizards were taught
the Foundations of Wizardry:
 
    1. All wizards are brothers and sisters in their Order. All orders are
       brothers and sisters in their Art.
    2. The places of High Sorcery are held in common among all Orders, and
       no sorcery is to be used there in anger against fellow wizards.
    3. The world beyond the walls of the Towers may bring brother against
       sister and order against order, but such is the way of the universe.
 
Outside the Towers, a Black Robe and a White Robe who found themselves on
opposite sides of a battle would not hesitate to unleash their mightiest
spells in an attempt to destroy one another. Yet within the Towers, these
same two may be found eagerly trading notes on magical research in perfect
harmony. It is this loyalty to the magic above all that enabled the Orders of
High Sorcery to remain in a world where they have occasionally been hunted
and persecuted as a "threat to society".

For ranking structure, see 'HELP CONCLAVE RANKS'
For information on each Order, see 'HELP WHITE ROBES', 'HELP RED ROBES', and
'HELP BLACK ROBES'
~

0 RED ROBES~
{RWizards of the Red Robes{x

Red Robe wizards delicately tread the path of Neutrality.  In addition to
their ultimate loyalty to magic, Red Robe wizards work to balance Good and
Evil, often acting as the moderating voice of reason and peace.  While the
forces of Good and Evil battle for control of Krynn, the forces of
Neutrality seek only to maintain the balance that keeps the world moving.  
 
RENEGADES: Red Robe wizards try to capture the renegade and bring them before
the Conclave, if possible. If not, the Red Robes do whatever is in their
power to destroy the renegade. Balance must be maintained.

0 red robes~
{RORDER OF LUNITARI THE RED{x
The red robed wizards are a collection of souls whose primary interest in 
the art is the maintenance of the balance of neutrality on Krynn. 
Engrossed in studies of illusionary and nonpreferential magical practices, 
the scarlet magi owe their allegiance to the goddess Lunitari. Daughter of 
Gilean of Neutrality, Lunitari is embodied in the scarlet moon which is 
also her symbol. She governs the arts of illusionary and neutral magic and 
encourages her faithful to avoid the over-zealous piety of the white robes 
and the dangerous, ambitious greed of the order of black. 
Magi of Lunitari are able to cast any spell they may memorize and perform, 
but their strengths lie in illusion as it is blessed by the Scarlet Lady. 
More faithful magi will avoid spells that lend themselves to other orders 
and avoid at all costs any spell that threatens to disrupt the Balance. 
Though many of the magi may avoid helping or hurting others to avoid 
further disruption, a few have come to terms with the pendulum theory and 
extend aid or harm where they deem appropriate, as they believe that all 
occurances simply accumulate to form the Balance they revere. In direct 
result, red magi are the most fair and open-minded of the three orders 
often siding with either the white robes or the black robes at a simple 
whim of their own constitution. 
The strength of the spells cast by wizards of Lunitari wax and wane with 
the position of the red moon in the heavens. A sorceror with faith feels 
most powerful and alert when the red moon shines full above him. It is 
during this magical time that illusions are most powerful and the 
Balance fills the hearts of the faithful with the will to spread the 
Lady's philosophies to those about them. 

Liturgy Of Lunitari 
Red Moon arising
Lady of Crimson
Rubies exalt you
Blooded Red ribbon
Grant we your Children
The right by Your Light

Lunitari of Gilean
Your shine ever blind

0 'BLACK ROBES'~
{DWizards of the Black Robes{x

Black Robe wizards embrace the cause of Evil.  They do not, however, hurl
random fireballs at peasant's cottages (at least, not usually), since such
activities would abuse and jeopardize their primary loyalty, which is to
magic itself.  Black Robe wizards may be cruel, but they are also selfish
and cunning, and avoid open acts of violence if a more subtle way can be
found.  
 
RENEGADES: Black Robe wizards try to convince the renegade to join the
Black Robes, hoping to add a new member to their ranks. If the renegade
refuses, the Black Robes destroy him without hesitation.

~

0 WHITE ROBES~
{WWizards of the White Robes{x

White Robe wizards work to promote Good.  Aside from their vow to support
magic, the cause of Good is their central concern.  Acts that violate the
precepts of Good can lead to the wizard's ruin.  White Robe wizards who
stray from the path soon find they lose the blessings of their patron deity,
Solinari.  White Robe wizards assist quests and causes undertaken in the
name of good, sometimes finding themselves allied with clerics of the gods
of Good and occasionally with the Knights of Solamnia.  
 
RENEGADES: Wizards of the White Robes try to hunt down and capture the
renegade to bring him or her before the Conclave, preferably without hurting
the renegade too much. Should they fail, they report the renegade to the
Tower, while trying to keep a close watch on the renegade's actions. White
Robes only try to destroy the renegade as a last resort, if he or she
represents a serious threat to the balance or is a threat to the lives of
others.

0 GILEAN~
{RGilean, the Sage{x

The brother of Paladine and Takhisis, Gilean is the chief of the deities
of Neutrality, and the keeper of the Tobril; the book of knowledge and the
record of the High God's plan of creation.  Often appearing passionless and
uncaring, Gilean is an observer; choosing to interfere in the development of
mortals only when the order of Creation is challenged.  Even then, he
upholds the rights of mortals to choose their own destiny.  
 
Gilean is modest in all things, never boasting of his knowledge or power. He
takes a scholar's delight in watching others discover truth and solve problems.
Gilean plays peacekeeper, hoping that the world will be spared a war that
could destroy it and the knowledge within it.
 
Other Names: The Gate of Souls, Void
 
Symbol: An open book
Color: Gray
Celestial Symbol: The constellation "Book of Souls"
Alignment: Neutral
Influences: Balance, knowledge, learning, freedom, watchfulness
Common Worshippers: Scribes, historians, teachers
Favored Weapon: Quarterstaff
Preferred vestments: Hooded gray robe, silver medallion of faith
 
Gilean's Avatars: Gilean takes the form of a book-toting scholar of middle
age, intent on a particular topic and abesnt-minded about everything else. This
male or female avatar may appear as a human, elf, dwarf or kender. Although
apparently self-absorbed, Gilean slyly tests the preconceptions of folk he
encounters. Those who learn from such tests gain a bit of secret knowledge or
an answer to a troubling question.

0 SIRRION~
{RSirrion, the Flowing Flame{x

Sirrion is the god of creativity and passion.  He sculpts the fire of the
soul into beautiful forms and controls every physical flame, from the fiery
sun to the meager light of the candle.  Alchemy is his domain, as it is the
art of transforming one state into another, often through the use of
purifying fire.  Sirrion sparks forest fires to clear old trees and let new
ones grow.  He burns those that play with fire to teach them to respect it. 
Only when fires rage out of control do they belong to Sargonnas, the deity
of volcanoes and destruction.  Sirrion's mate is Shinare, the goddess of
industry and commerce.  Theirs is a fiery relationship; Shinare is
opportunistic and pragmatic, while Sirrion is an artist.  Despite this,
their love is profound.  
 
Other Names: The Wizard (Mithas), The Alchemist, Firemaster
 
Symbol: Multicolored fire
Colors: {RBright reds{x and {YYellows{x
Celestial Symbol: The planet Sirrion

Common Worshippers: Alchemists, lovers, bards, gnomes
Favored Weapon: Heavy flail
Preferred vestments: Flowing red and yellow robes
 
Sirrion's Avatars: Sirrion prefers to appear in fire and auguries of smoke
or ash. When he does take an avatar form, Sirrion is a tall man with flaming
hair, beard, and eyebrows. His robe periodically changes color the way flames
do.

0 REORX~
{RReorx, the Forge{x

According to the dwarves and gnomes, Reorx, god of the forge, is the
greatest deity of the entire pantheon.  Reorx is the supreme god of the
dwarves, who consider themselves to be his chosen people (although gnomes
also consider themselves the "true chosen of Reorx").  In actuality, Reorx
loves both races equally.  His second greatest creation, the Greygem of
Gargath, led to the emergence of dwarves, gnomes, and kender.  Many consider
the forge god father of these races.  
 
Reorx works with Shinare, goddess of commerce and industry, to spur dwarven
economies. He grants inspiration to the gnomes, so they can invent wonderful
machines. He does not try to directly guide kender, but he is fond of them
and watches over them.
 
Other Names: Anvil (Elian), The Weaponmaster (Mithas)
 
Symbol: A forging hammer
Colors: {DSlate gray{x and {RRed{x
Celestial Symbol: The planet Reorx
Alignment: Neutral
Influences: Creation, gambling, engineering, metallurgy, artisans
Common Worshippers: Dwarves, gnomes, blacksmiths
Favored Weapon: Warhammer
Preferred vestments: Slate gray tabard, or red robes (formal)
 
Reorx's Avatar: Most report Reorx's avatar to be a rotund, jolly dwarf given
to excesses of gambling and drinking. His clothes are flamboyant and his
long, full beard is a glossy black. There are rumors of such a dwarf by the
name of Dougan Redhammer, but none have been confirmed. To the dwarves, Reorx
appears as the perfect dwarven warrior: well-muscled, dressed in a beautiful
adamantine breastplate, and braided beard of blue-gray.

0 CHISLEV~
{RChislev, the Beast{x

Chislev is nature incarnate.  According to legend, the seasons change
with the moods of her heart: her sorrow brings the fall, her despair the
winter, her hope the spring, and her joy the summer.  She can be furious and
dangerous as a hurricane or calm as a meadow in spring.  When she is angry,
she musters the violence of nature against those who offend her.  Every
animal and plant on Krynn reveres Chislev, as do the members of many
humanoid races.  
 
Chislev and Zivilyn love each other profoundly. They have no children,
because to Chislev, the animals and plants are her children. Chislev is
allied with Habbakuk, and works with him to restore areas damaged by fire
or war. She opposes Shinare, as industry has a way of destroying the
environment, but so far theirs is a verbal dispute. Chislev despises
Morgion and Zeboim in particular.
 
Other Names: Kisla the Mother (Sea elves), Wild One (Mithas)
 
Symbol: A feather
Colors: {yBrown{x, {YYellow{x, and {GGreen{x
Celestial Symbol: The planet Chislev

Common Worshippers: Elves, druids, farmers
Favored Weapon: Short spear
Preferred vestments: Brown robes, green hood/leggings, wooden medallion
 
Chislev's Avatars: Chislev usually appears as a beautiful human or elven
woman. In either form, her hair glows like golden sunlight, and her clothes
appear to be made from living plants. She carries a living wooden staff.
On occasions when she does not wish to speak with anyone, she appears as
a unicorn.

0 ZIVILYN~
{RZivilyn, the Tree of Life{x

Zivilyn is the deity of wisdom, bearer of all the insight of the
universe.  His branches reach into every time and place, into the past and
the future.  Zivilyn exists simultaneously in all times and places.  His
realm is awareness, balance, and understanding.  Zivilyn is calm, confident,
certain of himself.  He never rages or storms.  Zivilyn works with his mate
Chislev to maintain balance in the world of Krynn.  He acts as Gilean's
closest advisor, for wisdom and knowledge go hand in hand; and Gilean's
aloof, cold nature requires the soothing temperance of Zivilyn's
compassionate understanding.  Zivilyn is opposed to the consuming hatred
shown by deities such as Sargonnas and Takhisis, and the martial ambition of
Kiri-Jolith, but Zivilyn counts no god as his enemy.  
 
Other Names: Wise One (Mithas), World Tree
 
Symbol: A great green and gold tree
Colors: {gGreen{x and {yGold{x
Celestial Symbol: The planet Zivilyn
Alignment: Neutral

Common Worshippers: Philosophers, mediators, scholars
Favored Weapon: Quarterstaff
Preferred vestments: A simple, moss-green robe, gold medallion of faith
 
Zivilyn's Avatars: Zivilyn assumes many different forms. Some have seen
him as an old, balding man with a long beard. Though not blind, his eyes
appear as twin windows looking out into space. Persons who gaze into those
eyes learn their future, including the circumstances of their death. Others
report Zivilyn as a prophetic child with black skin, white hair and eyes
of quicksilver. Recently, several scholars have even proposed that the
ageless Astinus of Palanthas is a branch of Zivilyn, although no confirmation
currently exists.

0 SHINARE~
{RShinare, Winged Victory{x

Shinare is the goddess of wealth, industry and commerce.  The dwarves
revere her as the "Silver Master", the male patron of industry and wealth. 
Shinare cannot tolerate laziness.  She ascribes poverty to stupidity or
sloth.  In her eyes, the idle and unproductive are slowly dying.  
 
Shinare's companion is Sirrion, the god of creative fire. While Shinare is
practical and pragmatic, Sirrion is a dreamer and an artist. Each deity
complements the other. Although their relationship is far from stable, they
work together to make the world and its people prosperous. Shinare is fond of
Reorx, due to their shared interests, and because of the strong bond between
artisan and merchant. Shinare's sworn enemy is Hiddukel, whose greed and
shady business practices give all business owners a bad name.
 
Other Names: Balance of the Scales (Mithas), Silver Master (Thorbardin),
Walking Liberty (Ergoth), Winged One (Elven lands)
 
Symbol: Griffon's wing
Colors: {YGold{x, {CSilver{x, and {yBrown{x

Alignment: Lawful Neutral
Influences: Wealth, commerce, travel
Common Worshippers: Merchants, traders, mercenaries, dwarves
Favored Weapon: Light mace
Preferred vestments: Fine robes, jewelry and gold
 
Shinare's Avatars: Shinare most often assumes the guise of a rich, portly
matron or merchant. She wears expensive clothing and jewelry, and a belt
of fine silver encircles her waist. When appearing to dwarves, she takes the
form of a male dwarven merchant. Because dwarves are so loyal to her
philosophies, she acquiesces to their stubborn insistence that she is male.
Mortal gender should not stand in the way of progress.

0 LUNITARI~
{RLunitari, the Veiled Maiden{x

Lunitari is the daughter of Gilean, and is said to have sprung fully
formed from his thoughts.  Lunitari is a vivacious young woman and a
trickster, using her magic to create illusions designed to amuse and
entertain.  She seeks to balance the ambitions of her cousins, Solinari and
Nuitari, and opposes any deity who threatens the continued existence of
magic on Krynn.  Lunitari is the patron deity of the Red Robe Wizards of
High Sorcery.  
 
Other Names: Luin (Ergoth), Maid of Illusion (Mithas), Red-Eye (Goodlund),

anything, from a draconian to a gnome. Lunitari carries ruby red darts as
her weapon of last resort.

0 TAKHISIS~
{DTakhisis, Queen of Darkness{x

Sister of Paladine and Gilean, Takhisis is the Queen of Darkness and
embodiment of evil. Cruel and brilliant, she can be seductive and charming
to gain what she wants. She sees the prized spirits of the mortals upon
Krynn as her key to ultimate triumph over all the other gods, and to this
end she enjoys preying on the weaknesses of others; using their hearts'
desires to corrupt them and turn their strengths against them. Selfish and
conniving, her goal is for all creatures of the world to worship only her.
Thus began the never-ending war between the deities of Good and Evil.

The evil dragons are favorites of Takhisis, and the only beings on Krynn
she respects. She promises her dragons that someday they will help her
rule the world. Takhisis despises the other deities, even those devoted
to the cause of Evil. Her marriage to Sargonnas is one of convenience,
and is often plagued by strife as they constantly compete for dominance;
neither has any care or respect for the other.

Other Names: Dragon Queen (Ergoth, Silvanesti), Nilat the Corruptor (Icewall),
She of the Many Faces (Hylo), Tamex the False Metal (Thorbardin),
Lady Chaos (Mithas), Darklady (Ogre), Mwarg (Hobgoblin), Mai-tat (Tarsis),

Takhisis' Avatars: Takhisis most often appears as a beautiful woman with
pale skin and black hair. Other avatars include a tall muscular warrior in
full black platemail, and a five-headed dragon; each head corresponding to
one of the chromatic dragons found upon Krynn.

0 SARGONNAS~
{DSargonnas, Dark Vengeance{x

Sargonnas is the consort of Takhisis, and a mystery to the peoples of
Ansalon; a role he fosters.  The brooding deity prefers to work alone and in
isolation.  Though at times he may be forced to ally with them, he feels no
commitment to the other dark gods.  The god of vengeance, rage, deserts, and
volcanoes, Sargonnas embodies the destructive passion of fire.  His greatest
ally, Takhisis, is also his greatest enemy, and he routinely plots both for
and against his Queen.  
 
Sargonnas despises the gods of Good, with the exception of Kiri-Jolith, for
whom he feels a grudging respect. A fuming and treacherous god, Sargonnas
presents a calm and diabolically magnetic personality; plotting for years,
even centuries toward his final objective - ascendancy over his consort.
 
Other Names: Argon (Ergoth), The Firebringer (Hylo), Kinis (Qualinesti),
Gonnas the Willful (Icewall), Kinthalas (Silvanesti), Misal-Lasim (Tarsis),
Sargas (Mithas), Sargonx the Bender (Thorbardin)
 
Symbol: Stylized red condor

Alignment: Lawful Evil
Influences: Vengeance, conquest, strength, rage
Common Worshippers: Minotaurs, bounty hunters, fighters
Favored Weapon: Great-axe
Preferred vestments: Red robes or tabard with black satin trim
 
Sargonnas' Avatars: Sargonnas prefers the form of a red condor with a silky,
enticing voice. He also appears as a fire elemental of lava with a roaring
voice that sounds like a dwarven blast furnace. Occasionally, he takes the
form of a human, kender or minotaur warrior, but he is loath to do so.

0 MORGION~
{DMorgion, the Black Wind{x

The god of pestilence, decay, and disease, Morgion is widely feared by
almost all humanoid races.  Those few who worship him are reviled and almost
always conduct their worship in secret.  Even the other evil deities refuse
to associate with him.  Morgion is surrounded by a host of diseased spirits,
and has the aspect of a rotting humanoid figure, neither male nor female,
with a goat's head.  
 
Morgion despises all healthy things, striving to destroy or corrupt them with
disease and decay. He actively sabotages Mishakal's attempts to heal the

0 CHEMOSH~
{DChemosh, Lord of Death{x

Creator and ruler of the undead, Chemosh raises and animates corpses and
imprisons souls by tempting mortals with promises of eternal "life"; dooming
them to a horrible existence as his undead slaves.  Dead and dying creatures
fascinate Chemosh.  The desperate, thrashing movements, the hoary rattle of
water in the lungs, the smell of decay all delight him.  Even so, he plans
never to experience death himself; instead growing in power and longevity
with each minion he gains.  Chemosh is subordinate to the Queen of Darkness,
and works closely with her to raise undead leaders for her armies on
Ansalon.  Chemosh also holds a special hatred for Majere, who embodies faith
in the ways of the High God and discipline in pursuing virtue.

black robe, or as a lich (an undead sorceror) clad in rotting finery. In
either guise, he bears a small obsidian sickle. The sickle directs him to
the target with the fullest lifeforce. Chemosh's true form is a bloated
satyr with a goat skull head.

0 ZEBOIM~
{DZeboim, Darkling Sea{x

Little known by those on land, widely feared by those who sail the seas,
Zeboim is the goddess of the sea and storms.  She represents the sea's
uncaring and tempestuous nature, though she also has fleeting moments of
tranquility.  Dwarves know nothing of Zeboim, and she delights in paying
back their ignorace by spilling dwarves from boats and watching their
heavy-boned bodies sink to the bottom.  Zeboim is ambivalent toward her
father, Sargonnas, sometimes courting his favor and that of minotaur sailors
who worship her, other times spurning him and condemning his followers to
death in the sea.  However, she is always careful never to cross her mother,
Takhisis.  
 
Zeboim has little concern for the other deities. The exception is Habbakuk,
who has dominion over all the creatures of the deep; a dominion Zeboim feels
she should rule alone. The two detest each other and wage war continually; a
constant battle that is said to create the waves that crash endlessly against
the shore.
 
Other Names: Maelstrom (Mithas), Rann (Ergoth), Zebir Jotun (Icewall),

of a giant sea turtle with a human female face.

0 HIDDUKEL~
{DHiddukel, the Prince of Lies{x

Hiddukel, god of ill-gotten wealth and deals, is the patron deity of
dishonest businessmen, merchants, and thieves.  A cunning dealmaker,
Hiddukel trades on greed.  Hiddukel constantly seeks to secure bargains,
which entail the swapping of wealth in exchange for a soul.  Although he is
calculating and predatory, he often takes the guise of a fawning and
fumbling merchant.  Those tricked into bargaining with him may gain what
they think is their heart's desire, only to find it brings them misery in
the end.  
 
Hiddukel is the enemy of Shinare, and their mutual hatred is transmitted
to their followers. Hiddukel offers rewards, such as slaves and riches, to
his followers who impede clerics and destroy temples of Shinare. Hiddukel
also opposes Reorx; but the deity of greed is a coward at heart, and does
nothing to risk angering the god of the dwarves.

beady eyes and an oily smile. He drapes his expansive girth with the finest
brocade and his knuckles are knobbed with false gemstones. Hiddukel avoids
physical combat, relying on spells and hired bodyguards.

0 NUITARI~
{DNuitari, the Devouring Dark{x

Cousin of Lunitari and Solinari, Nuitari is the patron of the Black Robe
Wizards of High Sorcery.  His primary ambition is to spread magic
(preferably black magic) throughout the world.  An intense and quiet god,
Nuitari continually researches new spells to grant his followers, seeking
the universe's arcane secrets.  But black magic comes at a price; though it
grants its users incredible power, it also slowly takes control of them. 
Nuitari observes in wry amusement as those who try to master his art are
overcome by its dark power.  
 
The son of Sargonnas and Takhisis, Nuitari detests his father, who dislikes
magic and those who wield it. He also distrusts Takhisis, whom he suspects of
trying to subvert his followers and convice them to worship her. Nuitari
is the twin brother of Zeboim, goddess of the sea.
 
Other Names: Black Hand (Balifor), Nightreaver (Mithas), Darkness (Elian),

0 PALADINE~
{WPaladine, the Platinum Dragon{x

As the Father of Good and Master of Law, Paladine is the spokesman for
the gods of Good.  A supreme leader, he does not interfere with the affairs
of his fellow beings as long as their doings do not counter the law of Good.
During the Age of Dreams, Paladine and his younger sibling Takhisis, Queen
of Darkness, infused the raw fury of chaos with form and purpose, creating
the first material beings; dragons.  Takhisis, jealous the first creations
were not entirely hers, corrupted the chromatic dragons to evil.  Paladine
replaced his fallen children with the good, metallic dragons, but Takhisis's
act began the rift between good and evil.  

Realizing the need for a more powerful weapon for Good, Paladine joined
with his sons Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk to create the Knights of Solamnia.
Though Paladine himself is the patron of the Order of the Rose, he is honored
by all orders of the Solamnic Knights.

upon mishap piles up around the flustered Fizban, but in the end, all
mistakes work together to form a startling victory. Paladine's other forms
include a perpetually smiling, rotund, and hard of hearing priest, and an
elderly Solamnic Knight bearing a dragon crest.

0 MISHAKAL~
{WMishakal, the Healing Hand{x

Mishakal is revered throughout Ansalon as the "Healer" and "Light
Bringer".  Gentle and compassionate, she seeks to heal ills and minister to
all creatures (whether good, neutral, or evil) through her servants on
Krynn.  Mishakal's gentleness should not be confused with weakness, however,
for if her power is ever roused to anger, she proves formidable; especially
with the other deities of Good beside her.  Mishakal is Paladine's wife and
advisor.  They are the parents of the twin gods Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk,
and of Solinari.  Mishakal is diametrically opposed to the evil god Morgion,
who seeks to spread disease and decay; anathema to Mishakal's healing hands.

excellent health and physical condition. Her flawless skin radiates a golden
light, unless she wishes to disguise herself. Even if she has dampened her
radiance, her latent power often deepens the natural blues in objects around
her - blue blossoms, blue lakes, blue eyes, and so forth. She wears a robe and
carries no armor or weaponry except her glowing blue crystal staff.

0 MAJERE~
{WMajere, Master of Mind{x

Majere is Paladine's closest friend and advisor among the gods of Good,
and the other deities of Good pay much heed to his teachings and prophecies
as well.  Majere is the god of meditation, faith, and dreams; he creates and
inspires the martial arts and all disciplines that lead to honest
confrontations of oneself.  Majere fervently opposes the Evil gods,
especially Chemosh.

Favored Weapon: Unarmed
Preferred vestments: Red or copper robe, copper medallion
 
Majere's Avatars: On Krynn, this quiet god takes one of two forms. The
first is a beautiful, blind female oracle. Despite her youth and loveliness,
the oracle is utterly bald. Majere also assumes the form of an ancient man,
equally bald. His stooped body is wrapped in a burlap robe and he carries
no weapon. In this form, Majere's perpetual smile of serenity proves
unnerving to those who are not truthful with themselves.

0 KIRI-JOLITH~
{WKiri-Jolith, Sword of Justice{x

Kiri-Jolith is the deity of glory, honor, obedience, justice, and
righteous warfare.  He is the eldest son of Paladine and Mishakal, and the
twin brother of Habbakuk.  Warriors who embrace Good revere Kiri-Jolith, as
do the Knights of Solamnia; especially the Order of the Sword, of which he
is patron.  Kiri-Jolith has a strong sense of honor and fair play.  He
targets only the guilty and avoids involving innocents.  He cannot tolerate
tyranny, fighting it with tireless heroism and discipline.  Though his
temper is not swift, it is sure when combat is justified.  
 
Other Names: Corij (Ergoth), Emperor (Mithas), Jolith (Kharolis, Tarsis),

0 HABBAKUK~
{WHabbakuk, the Fisher King{x

Habbakuk, also known as the "Fisher King" to his worshippers, created and
rules all creatures of land and sea.  Rangers and sailors especially revere
him and seek his protection against Zeboim, goddess of the sea and storms. 
Habbakuk makes creatures in his likeness; he is feral and merciless as the
wolf, gentle and timid as the rabbit.  The natural harmony of predator and
prey embodies Habbakuk, who is as much feared as he is loved.  Because he
represents the eternal cycle of nature, Habbakuk becomes a symbol of eternal
life beyond death; exemplified by his phoenix aspect.  Son of Paladine and
Mishakal, Habbakuk is the younger twin of Kiri-Jolith.  
 
Other Names: Abbuku the Fisher (Sea elves), the Blue Phoenix (Qualinesti,

populations together to experience the harmony of living.  Companion to

deific glow. In this way, he can join the festivities without garnering
bothersome adulation. Branchala's avatars unfailingly display some
association with the forest. He appears as a woodsman, a ranger, a bard
of a great forest, or even a heathen druid; any guise associated with trees.

Solinari is the hand of white magic, the patron deity of all the White

throughout the world, and to bring more worthy mages to the Order of the
White Robes.  He works closely with his cousins Lunitari and Nuitari to
protect and foster magic on Krynn.  Treasuring magic over every aspect of

gods, he rarely assumes his avatar form. When he must directly intervene, he
appears as an ancient, white robed wizard. Solinari's avatar has a lucid,
insightful, and recursive intellect; though his mumblings often become too
cryptic to decipher.

1 KNIGHT~
The chivalrous Knights are experts in combat.  Skilled in most forms of
battle, Knights differ from warriors in that they are more disciplined and
must follow the strict rules of their order.  Knights also tend to be very
religious and it is from their religious beliefs that they gain some of
their and abilities.  No matter his cause, be it for good or evil; in
defense or defiance of law, the knight is a universal symbol of
guardianship, has an unbending will of an absolute ruler, and the
destructive force of a mighty siege engine.  The knight stands for all of
this in the name of his duty.  Those enjoying his protection live their
lives in peace, while those who seek to subvert it find themselves scaling
sheer battlements as they struggle beneath the boiling blood of the knight's
determination.  There are knights, of course, whose bastions have been
crushed, or who have lost sight of their purpose, and these are tragic
souls...  But they are still not to be crossed.  Often times, despair and
distrust wield swords far more powerful than those of belief and idealism. 
The Knight is a master of heavy arms, just as skilled at sheathing himself
in steel as he is at sheathing steel in his enemies.  His abilities reflect
the tremendous strength that allows him to move freely in armor that would
break an ordinary man, as well as the indomitable will that forged him into
the deadliest of weapons.

{WFor a detailed help on each order type: HELP KNIGHT CROWN, HELP KNIGHT
SWORD, HELP KNIGHT ROSE.  {x 
 
HISTORY
The Knights of Solamnia arose in the Age of Dreams, about three millennia 
before the War of the Lance. The order was founded the commander of the 
Ergothian Palace Guard, Vinas Solamnus. Sent by his Emperor to quell a 
rebellion in northeastern Ergoth, Vinas saw instead that the rebellion was 
justified. 
 
During the Third Dragon War, a young knight of the Crown became a legend
and the most enduring symbol of Solamnic Honor and sacrifice when he and
the silver dragon known as Heart receive the first Dragonlance and sacrifice
themselves to banish Takhisis and her evil dragons from the world.
To this day, the knight known as Huma Dragonbane is revered and celebrated
as the Knighthood's greatest hero.
 
Blamed unjustly for the Cataclysm, the Knighthood was reviled during the
Age of Despair and many knights abandoned their sacred oaths. A courageous
few remained steadfast to their code and the Knighthood gained respect and
power during the War of the Lance. Having once forgotten the spirit of the
Oath in favor of the unfeeling letter of the Measure, it took a noble act
of sacrifice by another young man named Sturm Brightblade to remind the
Knighthood that honor lies in the heart of each knight, not in a set of
dusty books.
 
For countless generations, the Knights of Solamnia were drawn only from
Solamnic nobility,  and often with families tied very close to the Knighthood.
During and after the War of the Lance, however, the knights opened their
ranks to non-Solamnics and allowed those not of noble blood to ascend to
their highest ranks.
 
THE OATH AND THE MEASURE
All knights are bound by the Oath "Est Sularus oth Mithas", meaning "My honor
is my life". A knight's actions throughout life are defined by an extensive
code of laws known as the Measure.
 
The Oath and the Measure provide the knight courage in the face of terrible
danger, give the knight strength when the knight's own is failing, and
grant the knight guidance when confronted with difficult choices. The Oath
and the Measure lead a knight to champion the cause of Good and uphold the
laws (at least those that are consistant with his beliefs). An honorable
knight helps those in need, without expecting or requesting a reward.
 
REQUIREMENTS:
All those wishing to join the SOLAMNIC order must meet the following:
 
ALIGNMENT - All prospective members must be of Lawful or Neutral ethos, with
Lawful being strongly preferred. Alignment must be Good; those who change or
do not maintain this alignment will be removed if discovered.
 
RELIGION: While the knighthood reveres all gods of Good, all squires and
knights are expected to remain devoted to one of the three patron gods of
the knighthood: Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, or Habbakuk.
 
RACE RESTRICTIONS:
Traditionally, the knights have allowed only humans to join their ranks,
though after the War of the Lance they began to accept half-elves among
their numbers. Exceptional individuals of other races /may/ be considered for
knighthood, however most are instead encouraged to serve in the Solamnic
Auxillary - a volunteer reserve unit overseen by the Order of the Sword.
 
ACCEPTED CLASSES: Knights, Warriors, Barbarians, Clerics, and Battlemages
are currently the only classes considered eligible for full knighthood.
 
Those wishing to join may send a note to SOLAMNIC, or contact a Lord Knight
to arrange an interview.

1 'KNIGHT TAKHISIS' KOT~
{DThe Knights of Takhisis{x

 The Knights of Takhisis are a military Order created for, and dedicated
to, a single cause, the total and unquestioned domination of Krynn in the
name of Her Dark Majesty, Queen Takhisis.  
 
Lord Ariakan, the purported son of Dragon Highlord Ariakas and the goddess
Zeboim, founded the Knights of Takhisis after spending six years as a prisoner
of the Knights of Solamnia, during which time he learned all he could from
them; the strengths and weaknesses of their Measure and the value in their
system of honor and discipline.
 
Ariakan maintained that the keys to victory are order, discipline, and vision:
"Bring order to our followers, and they will accomplish. Discipline them, and
they will achieve. Give them vision, and they will move forward toward a common
goal". In accordance with this, Ariakan created the foundations of the Knights
of Takhisis - the Vision, the Blood Oath, and the Code.

High King, which requires the acquisition of the Hammer of Kharas, the most
famous Hylar next to Derkin Lawgiver.  The Hylar claim to be the oldest

 Daewar are the dwarven craftsmen.  They excell at battle and at

acquisition of wealth and are usually the merchants of dwarvenkind.  Severus
Stonehand is perhaps the most famous Daewar.  The Daewar are the middle
class of dwarves, forming the artisans, architects and merchants.  Their
name means "dearest".  
~

0 THEIWAR~
THEIWAR DWARVES

Theiwar are the dark dwarves.  Conniving and scheming, Theiwar are always
looking for ways to further their own evil self interest.  Theiwar prefer
the dark dwellings of Thorbardin, and are easily distinguishable from other
dwarves because of their paler complexions, larger eyes and their ability to
use magic.  In the early days of dwarven society, the Magi of High Sorcery
taught magic to the dwarves but it quickly became apparent that the magical
powers had an unpleasant effect on them.  Magic-using dwarves became twisted
in mind and body, and were referred to by the other dwarves as "derro" -
degenerate.  These derro formed their own caste within dwarven society, the
Theiwar, or "thankless" since they felt that they had been betrayed by their
own kind through no fault of their own.  The Towers of High Sorcery stopped
teaching the dwarves, but the Theiwar already knew much of their magical
theory and it was passed down throughout the ages.  Theiwar practice their
magic without the controls placed on High Sorcerers, and there are rumours
of dealings with demonic forces.  
~

0 DAERGAR~
DAERGAR DWARVES

In Thorbardin, an offshoot of the Thiewar appeared, the Daergar
("deepest").  Whereas the Thiewar sought what they saw as their rightful
place in dwarven society (many Theiwar were of Hylar stock), the Daergar
turned their back on the others and delved deeper, forming their own society
away from outside interference.  All the same, Theiwar and Daergar
representatives were allowed on the Council of Thanes.  The Hylar allowed
them on the principle of "keep your friends close, but your enemies closer",
and the derro accepted for much the same reasons.  These are the dumbest
dwarves.  Daergar are the counterpart of the Theiwar in much the same way
the Daewar are the counterpart of the Hylarthey are the brawn behind the
Theiwar brains.  However, they are not allies: the Daergar are even more
murderous than their Theiwar cousins, and much more prone to physical
violence rather than cunning to resolve any given situation.  
~

0 DEWAR~
DEWAR DWARVES

Not to be confused with their Daewar cousins, the Dewar are a third group
of 'dark' dwarves.  They live in caverns beneath Thorbardin where the other
clans refuse to live.  The Dewar were exiled because of their insanity; now
after years of inbreeding, it has become that much more pronounced (in fact,
those deemed 'sane' are shunned).  The Dewar excel at killing and at
cruelty, and are quick to anger .  
~

0 AGHAR~
AGHAR DWARVES

One dwarven sub-group that is considered both caste and race are the
Aghar ("anguished"), known colloquially as "gully dwarves". These pathetic
creatures are thought to be a cross-breed between dwarf and gnome, but they
have inherited nothing but bad genes.  Aghar are considered beneath even
derro, and not true dwarves, but the Council of Thanes recognises them as a
separate caste out of some dwarven filial loyalty.  The Aghar, or Gully
Dwarves, are considered by many to be the most repulsive of races on Krynn. 
Gully dwarves are the diminutive cousins of true dwarves, though they still
have a seat on the Council of Thanes in Thorbardin.  Their leader, the
Highbulp, is the Aghar who is most accomplished at grovelling his way out of
any given situation.  Terrified of any threat, Gully Dwarves are
exceptionally hard-headed and stupid (in the entire history of the three
gully dwarf clans only Bupu - Raistlin Majere's charmed friend - and Raf -
Tika Waylan Majere's helper at the Inn of the Last Home, have had the
ability to count up to three).  
~

0 KLAR~
KLAR DWARVES

The Klar form the lowest caste of "true" dwarves, performing the menial
tasks of farming, mining and general construction.  Klar also form the bulk
of foot-soldiers in a dwarven army.  The Klar, a thanedom of hill dwarves,
were subjugated by the Hylar following the Dwarfgate War, and many now act
as servants to many Hylar, though they have their own underground city on
the banks of the Urkhan Sea.  They seek a leader to deliver them from their
plight.  Many of them are still a little crazy after losing the war.  
~

0 NEIDAR~
NEIDAR DWARVES

In Thorbardin, a fourth caste arose.  The Neidar ("nearest") were dwarves
that chose to live outside the mountain kingdom, closer to humans and elves.
They were mainly Klar farmers but were joined by Daewar merchants and a few
Hylar.  Over the years the Neidar came to be considered a new caste,
unrelated to the other three (although ties were strongest to the Klar, with
a certain cultural emphasis in hard work and simple living).  Neidar are
often termed "hill dwarves" by humans but it is not an expression they use
themselves. All hill dwarves are grouped into this thanedom. Defeated by the
mountain dwarves in the Dwarfgate War, this clan of dwarves lives in the
hills outside of Thorbardin.  They dislike the confines of the underground
fortress, but still seek representation on the Council of Thanes.  Neidar
are generally 'good' dwarves who exhibit none of the Theiwar of Daergar. 
The most famous Neidar dwarf is Flint Fireforge, Hero of the Lance.  
~

0 ZHAKAR~
ZHAKAR DWARVES

Another clan of evil dwarves, the Zhakar were the inhabitants of Thoradin
before they were defeated by Severus Stonehand.  The Zhakar were afflicted
with a strange illness, caused by a mold which resulted in their constant
state of decay: they could be considered lepers.  The Zhakar were thrown out
of Thoradin by Stonehand if they did not swear allegiance to him after their
defeat and removal of the mold curse.

0 ROLEPLAY ROLEPLAYING RP~
The first step in the wonders of Roleplaying is to get past Newbieness.
 
A) learn how to do as much as you can, so you are not always asking other
   players "how to" questions. 
B) Get the feel of the game overall, fight a few battles, die a few times. 
   Talk to some people.
C) While you are still a "newbie", try talking to people without discussing
   technical questions, bugs, PKing and cheating or even discussing skill
   percentages.  Keep your character to yourself, don't let anyone know
   how good / bad you are.  Apart from what they can see on the WHO list,
   don't let anyone in.  It's just not good roleplaying.  Don't let anyone
   know what your skill levels are.  "I HAVE my third attack at 98%."  It
   would be better to say ( If you were an arrogant Knight ) " I am the
   greatest Knight ever to walk the streets of Palanthas, ye (meaning "all
   of you") would be wise to stay clear of my path".  
D) Try to kill the internet lingo as much as possible.  E.  G.  The smiley 
   faces, :) :( ,etc..  LOL..  Brb.  1) However in times of crisis, and 
   battle, one does not want to take the time to type out "be right back" 
   when ones' life is at stake.  So shorthand does has its place.  Use emote
   messages instead * like this * e.  G.  * smiles *, * farts * ,etc. 
   If you can do this for one hour or so, you have hereby graduated past 
   newbie, and you are ready to go one to bigger and better RolePlaying 
   techniques.  
 
                     **** Why should we roleplay anyhow?  **** 
   The only reason anyone should roleplay is to have fun. This is a 
   roleplaying game after all and you should be having fun.  If you aren't 
   having fun roleplaying then perhaps MUD's aren't the type of games you 
   should be playing.  But, the bottom line is roleplaying is a way for
   you to develop your own character and a personality that is not your 
   own. The internet completely allows you to screen your true personality 
   from others. Use the anonymous nature of the internet to your advantage, 
   this is part of roleplaying.  
E) And finally, a few things to remember: Just because you can see someones 
   name on the WHOLIST, doesn't mean you know who they are when you see them
   in the same room as you and it's the first time they've played that 
   character.  Ask them, perhaps they don't want you to know, or perhaps 
   they'd be happy to tell you.  However, everything should be done as if 
   you ARE that character and not "Joe Schmuck from accross the street". 
   Treat everyone like a stranger, unless of course both of your characters
   have met before.  Another thing, if you were, for example, enemies with
   someone one day, you can't just be friends the next simply because you,
   personally slept on it.  Keep the RolePlay going.
 
               Have fun and experiment what works best for you!

0 THIEVES GUILD/CLAN~
{x                *** The Thieves Guild ***
We are a band of brothers, brought together by our uncanny thieving
skills. The Thieves guild is always looking for fresh souls to fill
it's ranks, making them one of the most powerful groups of people
to walk the face of Krynn. Members are strictly loyal to fellow
brothers, and the penalty of betrayal is quite fierce.  All members 
owe allegiance to their leader, and would follow that leader through
all realms imaginable if it was the leader's wish.  Knowledge is an
asset of a Thief.  Those who are willing to learn and to teach what
they know to others are looked on favorably.  All classes are
accepted, and alignments of neutral and evil.  The members of the
Thieves Guild seek personal gain, as well as the furtherment of the
Guild as an institution.  A Thief's life is a dangerous one, but also
a very profitable one.  Patience is a virtue and secrecy a very good
aspect of it's members.  If you wish to seek more information on the
Thieves Guild, seek out any of it's members, if you can find them
and ask. If you wish to become one of the elite, you MUST fill out
an application and send it to THIEVES for review. Upon a full review,
if you have been accepted, you will be sought out and inducted.
(ooc: application will be in a NOTE, and it will be sent to THIEVES
and nothing or nobody else)
~

0 QUALINESTI ELVES~
This is the nation formed by the split of Silvanesti following the
Kinslayer Wars. These 'high' elves left the east in an effort to get away
from the rigidity of their cousins; however they have become rigid over time
as well. The Qualinesti are more likely to leave Qualinost, the capital,
and venture out to see the rest of Krynn, though by no means is this common.
The Qualinesti are ruled by the Speaker of the Suns.  The most famous and
notable Qualinesti elves are the likes of Kith-Kanan, Laurana, Gilthanas,
Porthios and (to a certain extent) Tanis Half-Elven.  
~

0 SILVANESTI ELVES~
These are the 'grey' elves of Krynn.  They consider themselves to be the
"purest" elves, in fact, they fought the Kinslayer Wars because of it.
Silvanesti, the traditional elvenhome, went to war with the Ergothian Empire
to preserve their purity and to root out the half-elves born through illicit
unions of elves and humans.  After the war, the elven nation split, and
those choosing to remain in Silvanesti became even more set in their ways. 
The Silvanesti are ruled by the Speaker of the Stars, who lives in the
capital, Silvanost. Famous Silvanesti are Silvanos, Lorac Caladon, Alhana
Starbreeze and Dalamar the Dark.  
~

0 KAGONESTI ELVES~
The wilder elves live in the large forests all over Krynn.  Kagonesti
elves generally are stronger and bigger than their civilized cousins and
dislike the hustle and bustle of the big cities, preferring the quiet
atmosphere of their forests.  The Kagonesti almost perished during the
Cataclysm and now call the Ergothian isles their home.  The most famous
Kagonesti is Kagonos, the first Pathfinder (leader of the Kagonesti), who
led the wilder elves away from the council of Sinthal-Elish, thus separating
from their Silvanesti cousins.  
~

0 DARGONESTI ELVES~
The Dargonesti are sea elves who live off the eastern coasts of Ansalon. 
Rumor has it that the Dargonesti were originally land elves who were
mariners and were transformed into aquatic elves by the passing of the
Graygem. The Dargonesti are the 'grey' elves of the sea. They are more
civilized than their Dimernesti cousins.  Dargonesti elves are lead by the
Speaker of the Moons.  Though little is known of them, the Dargonesti have
bluish skin, as well as webbed feet and gills.  In addition to being able to
breathe under water, the Dargonesti are able to transform themselves
into dolphins.  
~

0 DIMERNESTI ELVES~
Less is known about the Dimernesti elves than is known about the
Dargonesti.  The Dimernesti are the 'high' sea elves, with all the
characteristics of their Dargonesti cousins, with the exception that they
turn themselves into sea otters rather than dolphins.  The Dimernesti elves
are ruled by the Speaker of the Sea.  
~

0 MINOTAUR~
Minotaur live on the isles of Mithas and Kothas, on the northeastern
shores of the Blood Sea of Istar.  Minotaur live to be about 150 years old. 
They are intensely proud creatures, growing to be 7 feet tall, with horns of
up to 24" long.  Minotaur are half-human and half-cow.  Bovine is just about
the worst insult anyone can hurl at a minotaur (it's one of the kender's
favorite).  In order for one to advance in minotaur society, they must fight
in the Arena.  Only champions of the Arena can be leaders.  Minotaur believe
that might makes right.  Additionally, nothing is more important to a
minotaur than his or her honor.  In any event, the ruler of this sea-faring
race is the one who defeats all his opponents in the ring and becomes the
Champion.  The goals of their race are simple: the destruction of all the
other races of Krynn.  They are exceptionally bigoted, seeing all other
races as lesser beings.  The only other creatures most minotaur hold in a
high regard are the Knights of Solamnia, renowned for their code of honor;
this is their one saving grace, in the minotaur's eyes.  As far as weapons
and armor go, the minotaur doesn't really need any.  His thick hide protects
him from some attacks, and his horns and limbs are deadly.  Most warriors
carry either a two-handed sword (used in one hand) or other slashing
weapons.  
~

0 BARBARIAN~
Generally, the barbarian humans are more like the Native American Indian
tribes which we know.  They generally live in small villages, in movable
structures, and wear skins rather than fabric.  Barbarians inhabit the
plains of Abanasinia, as well as the ice barbarians who live just north of
Icewall glacier.  Famous barbarians are Wanderer, Goldmoon and Riverwind.  
~

0 OGRE~
The biggest, tallest, fattest, and smelliest of all the races are the
Ogres. On average they stand about ten feet tall and weigh over four
hundred pounds. Being severely limited in intelligence and having an
overabundance of physical power is a often a catalyst for deadly
situations.

But we have to give these morons credit. A weakly structured
organization of civility has emerged from within the rank and file of
the Ogre encampments. The need for food and supplies has obviously
driven them to become more self-sufficient. While there is obvious
communication within their tribal communities, speaking with an Ogre is
not a recommended activity. 

The other races have learned that Ogres are quick to anger, and when
confused find it easier to smash and bash than to talk and walk. An
Ogre's main special trait is bashing. Being on the receiving end of one
of these is not a good idea. Ogres are the strongest and possess the
highest degrees of stamina.

These guys are not going to be wizards, magicians, or spell casters of
any kind (except Shaman). However, even the Ogre shaman is such a lowly
wizard that we question the existence of the character class
combination.
~

0 GNOME~
The Gnome race was created by the God Reorx in the Age of Twilight, as
the Humans he had taught so much (including the forging of steel),
began to ridicule him for being short and more interested in the
creation of things than actually using them, while the Humans saw them
merely as sources of income and wealth. He made them Tinker Gnomes (or
Gnomes for short) forever cursed to invent things that rarely worked as
intended.

The average Gnome is not very tall, slender, tends to have a large,
pointed nose, and lives for two things: His/Her Inventions and The
LifeQuest.

A LifeQuest is the most sacred of traditions in the Gnome society,
supreme even to the Committee. The situation is the same with most
Gnome families, with a few, rare, exceptions. The LifeQuest is designed
to have a great impact on their society, hence the difficulties (if
it's not difficult -how can you tell it from a mere accidental
invention?) of the labour involved.
~

0 HALF-ELF~
Half-Elves are usually much like their elven parent in appearance. They
are handsome folk, with the good features of both races. They mingle
freely with either race, being only slighly taller than the average elf
(5' 6" on average) and weighing about 150 pounds. They typically live
about 160 years. While they do not have all the abilities of the elf,
they are still somewhat resistant to sleep and charm spells and are
adept at finding hidden objects. Half-Elves also have Infravision up to
60' from their elven parent.They tend to identify more closely with the
elven parent, as humans tend to eye half-elves with suspicion.

Half-Elves also lack the distinct advantages and specializations of the
other races, although they have a small advantage in matters of nature
lore, and are slightly more intelligent than the average human. Thus
like humans, they are able to learn skills with more ease than those
races that are more specialised. Although not as good as a human in
this regard, a half-elf can still learn skills some 5% faster than his
or her non half-elven peers.

Half-Elves are perhaps the most diverse of all known races, made up of
people with hair of all different colours, and skin ranging the gamut
of human and elven skin colours. They most resemble their human side,
but are more slender than most humans, and have finely pointed ears.
Many Half-Elves have felt prejudice in their lifetimes, from both Elves
and Humans. Because of this, their personalities may be defensive, shy
and withdrawn, or ingratiating.
 
The Half-Elf race originated from the rare pairings of humans and
elves. Pure breeding among Half-Elves has subsequently distinguished
them as a unique race in their own right. Physically, they exhibit the
attributes of both Humans and Elves, but they constantly strive to find
a culture of their own. Although some societies composed solely of
Half-Elves have been formed, reflecting more of the regal status of the
Elves, Half-Elves most often struggle to assimilate into established
societies. Humans are much more tolerant than the Elves of this mixed
race due to their longer lifespans and (according to some) more
attractive appearance gained from their Elven blood. While their dual
nature has often been a hindrance, it has occasionally allowed the
Half-Elves to truly understand their forefathers, bringing remarkable
insights into the cultures of both peoples.

0 DRAG~
Syntax: DRAG <character> <direction>

Using this command, attempts to drag a player or mobile out of the room
you are in and into the next room in the direction you choose.  When you
drag someone to another room, if successful, you will also go with them in
the same direction, placing you both in the next room together.  However,
both you and the character your attempting to drag, must both be in a
standing position for this command to work at all.  
~

0 PUSH~
Syntax: PUSH <character> <direction>

Using this command, attempts to push a player or mobile out of the room
you are in, in the direction you choose to push them in.  If successful, the
character will be forced to go in that direction against their will. 
However, the character MUST be in a standing position for this command to
succeed at all.  
~

0 CHANNELS~
This command, typed with no other arguments, will give you the list of
channels available to you in this MUD.  It will also display YOUR status for
each one, displaying if each one is ON or OFF.  Each channel is a toggle
command.  Typing in a channel, with no argument after it, will toggle it on
and off.  This display, will also show you your current prompt.

For information on changing your prompt, please see 'HELP PROMPT'.  
~

0 VISABLE~
When you are invisable, irregardless if your HIDDEN or have the INVISABLE
spell casted upon you, this command will automatically cancel your invisable
affect and bring you back in the open, visable to anyone and everyone. 
Although there will be no prompt warning you that you've gone visable, this
command works 100% of the time, leaving you vulnerable till you HIDE or cast
INVIS upon yourself again.  
~

0 'KILL' 'MURDER'~
Syntax: MURDER <player victim>
Syntax: KILL   <mob victim>
 
KILL attacks a victim mob.  Note that this command will only successfully
attack a non-player characters (NPC or mob), and cannot be used to
initiate inter-player combat.
 
To attack a player, one must use the command MURDER. This will initiate
immediate combat and, if in a LAW abiding city, possibly mark you as a KILLER.
~

0 KENDER~
Kender are unique to Krynn.  They are the halflings which many other
worlds sport, but they are much more interesting than that.  Kender appear
to be small human childrenslight of build, beardless, about three and half
to four feet tall.  Kender generally live for 100 years (or until their;curiosity kills them).  Wanderlust is uniquely a kender trait, which is the
fever which possesses young kender and causes them to travel the world over.
Kender wander for years, settling down after they feel they have wandered
down all the roads their heart desires.  Wanderlust usually lasts for about
10 years.  In regard to personal belongings, kender have a relatively loose
definition of what is "theirs."  In a kender home, a relic is anything that
hasn't disappeared after three weeks.  Kender have the unique 'handling'
ability which allows them to "find" objects unconsciously.  If a kender were
to walk through a crowd of people, it would be unlikely if the kender's
pouches were not bulging with the belongings of at least half the people
there.  If anyone cornered him and asked him about it, the kender would
truthfully reply that "it must have fallen into my pouch.  It's a good thing;that I found it or somebody else might have taken it."  Because of their
naivete in regards to personal belongings (especially how they come to;possess those items which belong to other people), the worst name you may
call a kender is either a 'catpurse' or a 'thief,' for they believe that
they are neither, rather it was an accident, "remember?"  Kender also have a
trait which enables them to be entirely fearless.  While the rest of the
party shies away from the edge of the bottomless gorge, the kender will skip
merrily along the edge, cross the rotting foot bridge and stop to smell the
roses on the other side while being charged by an enraged minotaur. 
Everything is an adventure, including death, which is the last great
adventure (many a kender have wondered what it is like to be breathed upon;red dragon, but few who have experienced it live to tell the tale).  This
fearlessness might be interpreted as stupidity, but kender are fiendishly
clever in a child-like sort of way.

0 kendermore~
Welcome to Kendermore! This is a li'l town I threw together around a pub ;)
The town is based on the Kender of Krynn (Dragonlance fame), and on the
Kender history and ideology as espoused in Anonymud, the mud this area was
originally written for.

0 BALANCE~
This command will display the amount of coins you have in your bank account.
NOTE: This command only works when inside a bank, or whenever in the same
room as a banker.
~

0 OOC~
This game has removed ALL global channels used by Mortals.  The reason
behind this is to have a little more control with Roleplay enforcement and
also to prevent those unwanted spammers who insist on pissing everyone else
off by spamming a bunch of crap over a global channel.  This will also help
in the prevention of players discussing vital character information that is
to be kept to yourself, from being overheard by everyone playing.  Past
players ruined it for everyone.  Do not ask to have them re-installed, for
they never will.  
~

0 COMBINE~
This toggle command switches the way you see your inventory list.
With it toggled to see combined items, it will combine identical items,
for example, if you had 13 healing potions it will show up in your
inventory as (13) healing potions. Toggling it to see long inventory,
it would show up with each item taking up one line space. So, for example,
if you had 4 healing potions, you'd see something like this:

healing potion
healing potion
healing potion
healing potion

Using the combined inventory is best, for if you have a lot of items in your
inventory, you'll have a long, long list to scroll back up through to
see everything.

to the King of the Dead. Minions strive for unimaginable power, wealth, and 
pure destruction for those who follow the light. The overall goal of the 
Undead is to kill the living and make the Army of the Undead grow larger
and more powerful that will soon take over all of Krynn.

These are the appropriate armour stats for any piece of armour.
~

102 CLONE~
Syntax: CLONE <obj or mob name>
 
This skill will allow you to clone an exact replica of an item or MOB.
It is almost identical to LOAD, however, your creating a mirror image
of the object or mob. The object or mob, must be in the room, whether
it be on the ground, or in your inventory. This skill is very useful
when in a situation where you took an item which was already created
and you wanted to restring it to something else, and you had to make
fifty of them. Instead of having to go through the agonizing pain of
having to restring 50 objects, you only need to do so once, then clone
it till you have your desired amount, in this case, 50.
~

0 DRACONIANS~
Draconians arrived in Krynn toward the end of the Age of Despair. 
Created from the stolen eggs of good dragons and corrupted with dark magic
involving Black Robe wizards and dark clerics, draconians served as shock
troops and special forces during the War of the Lance.  Scattered draconian
forces that survived the war later relocated to isolated corners of Ansalon.
Some still plot to take over human or elven settlements, while the more
cautious avoid contact with other races.  
 
Five distinct types of Draconians exist, dependant on what variety of
dragon egg they were created from.

See also: 'HELP BAAZ', 'HELP KAPAK', 'HELP BOZAK', 'HELP SIVAK', 'HELP AURAK'.
~

102 GRAB~
This level 102 command is a very useful tool to use when someone has an
item in their inventory and you want to take it, for whatever purpose,
without having to force them to drop it or take your chances by stealing it.
This is a powerful command, please do not over abuse it by grabing
everything in a persons inventory, leaving them with nothing, wondering and
complaining that it all disappeared.  This command cannot be used to grab
items off of MOBs.  This is because it screws up the resets.  If you grab an
object off of a Shopkeeper, that means that he will no longer SELL that
object until a Copyover or Reboot is done, or the MOB is killed (by an
Immortal, as Mortals can't kill them).  
~

0 'MULTICHAR' 'MULTI-CHAR' 'MULTICHARING' 'MULTIPLAY' 'MULTIPLAYING' 'MULTI-PLAYING'~
Multi-Charing is against the RULES here at Legends of Krynn. We
define this as such:

        * Using knowledge gained by one character for another character

        * Gossiping or talking about your other characters

        * Using one of your characters to get eq for another one

        * Playing two or more characters at once (multiplaying)

Remember, each character has its own life.  One of your characters cannot
have ANY "interaction" with another, or share the other one's knowledge
since they have never actually met. Again - while it is permitted for
one of your characters to have "heard of" another by reputation, etc.,
they may NOT have ANY form of direct interaction. This includes, but is
not limited to, "talking" to one another IC, OOC, "off-camera", or anything
of the like. Nor can you create a "relative" of your own character and
attempt to use that as an excuse for info-sharing.
 
Abuses and/or violation of the above rules will result in a warning for
the FIRST offense, after which further offenses will result in DENIAL,
DELETION and possible siteban.
~

0 IC IN-CHARACTER~
This game has removed ALL global channels used by Mortals.  The reason
behind this is to have a little more control with Roleplay enforcement and
also to prevent those unwanted spammers who insist on pissing everyone else
off by spamming a bunch of crap over a global channel.  This will also help
in the prevention of players discussing vital character information that is
to be kept to yourself, from being overheard by everyone playing.  Past
players ruined it for everyone.  Do not ask to have them re-installed, for
they never will.

FORESTER
=------=------=------=------=------=------=------=------=------=------=------=
 
{x              --- The Forester Clan ---
NATURE, the gentlest mother, impatient of no child,
The feeblest or the waywardest, her admonition mild
In forest and the hill by traveler is heard,
Restraining rampant squirrel or too impetuous bird.
How fair her conversation, a summer afternoon
Her household, her assembly; and when the sun goes down
Her voice among the aisles incites the timid prayer
Of the minutest cricket, the most unworthy flower.
When all the children sleep she turns as long away
As will suffice to light her lamps; then, bending from the sky,
With infinite affection and infiniter care,
Her golden finger on her lip, wills silence everywhere.
-Emily Dickenson
{x 
The Foresters are a group dedicated to the safe keeping of the wildlands
of Krynn, and it's inhabitants.  Foresters tend to the wildlands and seek that 
they may be able to florish.  They believe in the right of all beings 
to experience them and learn their ways.  Understanding that trees may be
felled and animals may die, such is the natural order of things.  Though a
balance must be maintained.
{x
THE FORESTER'S CODE
Foresters work against villainy and wickedness wherever they find it but they 
work ever mindful of the consequences of what they do.
{x
Foresters work to educate those around them of the ways of the forest and 
respect of the forests.
{x
All beings should walk free of fear, with the right to live their lives as 
they wish.
{x
The rule of law aids peace and fosters freedom, so long as the laws are just 
and those who enforce them lenient and understanding.
{x
No extreme is good. For freedom to flourish, all must be in balance: the powers 
of realms, the reaches of the cities and the wilder lands into each other, and 
the influence of one being over another.
{x
Whatever it takes, a Forester will do. Pride never rules the deeds of a true 
Forester.
{x
Foresters can spare themselves less freedom than those they work to protect 
must have, but even a Forester must be free.
{x
Foresters police their own. A Foresters who hears the call of personal power 
can no longer hear the song of the forest. A Forester who seizes power, and 
holds it above all else, is a traitor to the forests. Traitors must die, for 
freedom to live.
{x
Without a past, no being can appreciate what they have, and where they may be 
going.
 
REQUIREMENTS:
All those who wish to become a FORESTER must meet the following:
{x
ALIGNMENT - Foresters are free spirits, much influence is placed on the Chaotic 
ethos, although those of Lawful or Neutral ethos are more than welcome to join.  
Alignment may be either Good or Neutral, Evil and the destruction which it bring
have no place within the Foresters, those who sucumb to it's embrace will be
forsaken by his fellows.
{X
RELIGION:
The Gods of Nature are first and foremost, these including Chislev, Habbakuk and
Branchala.  Although, as long as there is a willingness to learn, the followers
of any neutral or good god my become a member.
{x
RACE RESTRICTION:
Though the Foresters mainly consist of elves and humans, and half-elves, kender 
and dwarves are welcome.  Gnomes more often than not seek to tame and control 
the natural world, and thus, are unsuitable.  Those of evil descent (ogre, 
minotaur, theiwar dwarves and especially the abominations known as draconians)
are not accepted.
{x
ACCEPTED CLASSES:
All who believe in our ideals are more than welcome to join the Foresters, with
execption to those who seek death, destruction, wickedness and villiany 
(assassians and necromencers)  Also clerics (with exception to those who follow
natural gods) and knights are usually not accepted, due to their unyeilding
beliefs.
{x
Those wishing to join may send a note or approach a known Forester.
~

0 BREAK WEAPON~
Syntax: BREAK
Syntax: BREAK WEAPON

 This skill allows an experienced warrior the chance to destroy his or
her opponant's weapon in battle.  If successful, the opponant's weapon will
shatter into pieces, destroying their weapon for good and leaving them
weaponless.  This skill can only be used while wielding an axe.  No other
weapon will work.  
~

0 STATISTICS WISDOM INTELLIGENCE CONSTITUTION STRENGTH DEXTERITY~
Stats for your character determine its strengths and weaknesses:
Strength    : Physical power. Affects fighting, carrying weight, how heavy
              a weapon you may wield, how hard you hit.
Intelligence: Affects how much mana you gain per level, how well you can
              practice and improve skills and spells, how much mana you
              regenerate on each tick.
Wisdom      : Affects how many practices you gain per level, and mana
              gains.
Dexterity   : Affects fighting, particularly defenses, and physical tasks
              such as how much you can carry.
Constitution: Affects your character's health and regeneration of it.

Mages rely on intelligence, clerics on wisdom, warrior-classes on strength,
and thieves and assassins on dexterity. Your stats also affect, to a degree,
how effective your skills and spells are.
~

1 CAMOUFLAGE~
Syntax: camouflage
 
This skill works similar to HIDE and INVISABLE, with the exception that this
skill is for rangers only, and to see someone who's in this state, you need
the FOREST VISION spell.
 
This skill will blend an experienced Ranger in with his or her surroundings,
making them unseen to the unkeen eye. Moving around will force them to leave
their cover, once again making them quite visable to anyone passing by.
~

0 'FOURTH ATTACK'~
Like the third attack skill, fourth attack allows the character a chance at
an additional strike in combat, and increases the chance of a third attack
as well. Fourth attack, even at 100%, does not mean you'll get the hit in
all the time. Only Warriors, Knights, Barbarians and Rangers may learn
this skill.
~

0 COUNTER~
The counter skill is an advanced defensive fighting technique that allows
a skilled fighter to reverse his opponents attack and actually hit him back
with it.  This skill is automatic in battle, not requiring any command
inputs to be typed in.  
~

1 'CONVOKE SWARM'~
Syntax: cast 'convoke swarm' <victim>
 
This powerful high level spell calls forth a swarm of stinging insects.
This spell will not only hit your target however, but will also hit everyone
in the room.
~

1 'LIFE TRANSFER'~
Syntax: cast 'life transfer' <victim>
        c 'life transfer' <victim>
 
Thie spell is good when there are no clerics present to heal, or they are
simply, almost out of mana. If someone is dying, and desperately needs hit
points, the magic user can cast this spell on him. This spell will transfer
half of the caster's hit points, and put them into the target.
~

0 WHIRLWIND~
Syntax: whirlwind <victim>
        whirlwind
 
Grasping his/her weapon firmly, the knight or warrior spins around quickly,
damaging everyone within striking distance (to include invis and hidden) 
~

1 'MIND SHATTER'~
Syntax: cast 'mind shatter' <victim>
        c 'mind shatter' <victim>
 
This nasty little spell causes a mental breakdown in the victim's mental
state, making him or her more vulnerable to magical spells.
~

0 LUNGE~
Syntax: LUNGE <victim>
 
This skill is similar to the thieves skill, backstab. Lunging your opponant
will impale them with your weapon, landing a devastating blow. Make the 
first one count, for like backstab, you can only lunge once per round.
Lunging requires the use of an impaling type of weapon. Axes, swords,
spears and polearms are all weapons that may be used. Anything else
will result in failure.
~

0 conjuration~
Conjuration is a group of spells for both mages and clerics alike.  The
group offers a variety of spells which are used to conjure up different
things.
~

0 BUTCHER~
Syntax: BUTCHER CORPSE
 
This skill will allow Rangers and Barbarians alike to butcher up corpses,
turning them into delicious, juicy edible steaks. The amount of steaks
per corpse varries. No more letting good meat go to waste.
~

1 ETHEREAL 'ETHEREAL WARRIOR'~
This powerful spell allows an Illusionist to summon a powerful warrior,
of almost equal power to them, to help fight by their side.  The warrior
will remain to fight by their side loyally until death does them part.  Only
1 warrior is allowed to be summoned at any given time.  
~

1 BLACKJACK~
Syntax: BLACKJACK <victim>
 
This skill allows Thieves the ability to knock out their
victim unconscious, giving the Thief ample time to prepare for
battle. Blackjacking them will also give Thieves the upper
edge with their first attack, making their blade sink in deeper than normal
and inflicting more damage. An attack to someone who's been blackjacked will
wake the victim to their displeasure.
~

1 DEMAND~
Syntax: DEMAND <item> <mobile>
 
This skill is nothing like charming the mob or disarming the mob at all.
It is a special skill that one may try to use to get something he or she
wants from the mobile, without having to resort to a lengthy battle.
If you fail at your request however, the mobile will automatically
attack you, so be careful for what you wish for. It just may cost you
your life.
~

1 GLIDE~
Syntax: GLIDE
 
Some draconian races were able to fly or glide. This skill allows them
to do so. It will make them fly, able to reach places high up in the sky,
where before it required a flying spell, now will only require this simple
ability. This is not a gainable skill. Only Draconians gain this
skill automatically.
 
To land, see 'Help Land'
~

1 LAND~
Syntax: LAND
 
This is the command to land safely on the ground. It only works if your a
Draconian and your gliding. Like the GLIDE skill, this is not gainable
and comes automatically, so don't try to waste trains or practices to learn
it.
 
~

0 'CRITICAL STRIKE'~
This powerful skill allows someone who's well trained with their weapon
to deliver an extra hit.  It is automatic in battle, meaning there's nothing
to type to use it.  You will not see the amount of damage that it does, but
your victim sure will.  
~

0 CIRCLE CIRCLESTAB~
Syntax: circle
        circle <victim>
        circlestab <victim>
        ci <victim>


Because of their dexterity and finely tuned reflexes, thieves possess the 
innate ability to slowly circle their opponents and deal powerful stabbing
blows in-between normal rounds of combat.  Because this ability requires
the thief to go unnoticed by their opponent, it is imperative that he/she
not be receiving any blows during combat.  This skill cannot be used to
initiate combat, but is only usable when you are already in a fight of
some sort.
~

0 TRACK~
Syntax: track <target>


Searching the ground for clues, the player attempts to determine the
direction of his target, and approximate distance.
~

1 'DUAL WIELD'~
Syntax: DUAL <weapon>
 
This skill allows those who have learned and trained it, the ability to wield
two weapons at the same time in and out of combat. The only flaw is that one
can not be holding anything in their hands or holding anything as a shield.
The second weapon MUST be lighter than your primary, to be exact, your
secondary weapon must be HALF the weight of your primary in order to dual
wield. How you go about finding the right weapon combination, is all on you.
This skill is NOT something that adds double damage or hits. Simply, it
allows for an extra hit here and there, although not much, still better
than nothing. The most who benefit from having this skill are Thieves and
Assassins, where if wielding two daggers, they have a chance of successfuly
landing a double backstab, plunging not just one, but both of their daggers
into their opponants backs.
 
To remove your secondary weapon, see 'Help Remove'
~

1 'RAVAGE BITE'~
Syntax: RAVAGE <victim>
 
This viscious skill allows Barbarians the ability to unleash a bit of their
animal characteristics into battle. This skill allows them to leap onto
their opponant and ravagely bite into them, delivering a very painful blow.
~

1 DEATHGRIP~
Syntax: DEATH
{x        DEATH <weapon>
        DEATHGRIP
        DEATHGRIP <weapon>
 
This skill allows one to draw upon an ancient and dark magic, to imbue
their weapon with it's most evil power. This magic can only be applied while
wielding the weapon. Once the weapon is removed, the power will automaticaly
diminishes back to it's original state. This powerful skill can only be
used on your primary weapon, it can NOT be used on your secondary weapon, if
you can even use a secondary weapon.
~

1 BOUNTY~
Syntax: bounty
{x        bounty collect <player>
{x        bounty remove <player>
{x        bounty <player> <amount>

BOUNTY is the command used in conjunction with a Bounty Collector to place
and collect bounties.  With no argument, BOUNTY provides a list of all the
currently bountied individuals.

BOUNTY collect lets you collect the bounty on a player's head, assuming
you have the required proof.

BOUNTY remove lets a person remove a bounty placed on somebody's head.

BOUNTY with a player's name and amount places a bounty of that amount on
the player.

*** WARNING: YOU CAN NOT COLLECT A BOUNTY ON SOMEONE IF YOU SUBDUE THEM ***

For further information, see 'help bounty system'.
~

1 SILENCE~
Syntax: C 'SILENCE' <victim>
        CAST 'SILENCE' <victim>
 
This spell will numb your opponants tongue, rendering them unable to speak,
cast spells or anything else that requires the use of a tongue, will now
be useless. Very useful for those irratable Kender and Gnomes who like to
ramble on at the mouth about nothing and everything.
~

1 'FLAMING SHIELD'~
Syntax: c 'flaming shield'
 
This spell will give its user added shielding against attacks. It's main
purpose however, is to reduce the damage taken from cold-based attacks.
~

102 ASPERSON~
Syntax: ASPERSON <victim> <command>
 
This command is kind of like a silent force, where your victim never knows
that you did it, nor does he physically do anything. For example, if you
wanted to see what a person's score was, but would rather not go through
the hassle of snooping them, then forcing them to use the command SCORE,
making them full aware that someone is watching them, and scaring them. You
simply type ASPERSON victim score. This acts just like you switching into
their body, typing the command and then switching bakc to your original body
all the while they never feel, nor see you and what ever command your doing
the player will never see the affects of the command. Like as the example
score, you would see that person's score scroll before your eyes just as if
it is your own, however, the victim won't see it unless he types the command
for himself.
~

0 TRAJECT~
Syntax: TRAJECT <#> <victim>
 
This skill is similar to the life transfer spell, only that this is a skill
and it will transfer mana from you to someone else. You can only use what
you have, no more than that. The range limit is from 1 to your max.
~

1 'PLAY MUSIC'~
Syntax: PLAY <name of song>
 
Bards may use their cunning wits to sing songs, using it to their
advantage. Each song has different special abilities. To play any of
the songs, one must be of the appropriate level to play it and they must
be holding a musical instrument of some type. To see the list of songs
available, simply type SONGS. The list will show the full name as well as its
level to use. One must type out the full name of the song to use it.
~

1 'IGNORE' 'UNIGNORE'~
Syntax: IGNORE
        IGNORE <victim>
        UNIGNORE <victim>
 
Ignoring works similar to QUIET, only this command will target specific people
you don't want to hear nor talk to. You may ignore up to fifteen players
at once. Once you quit, your list will not be saved, it will purge itself and
the next time you log on, it will be back to zero, ignoring nobody. To use
these commands, simply type IGNORE and then the name of the person you wish
to ignore. To see your current list of players your ignoring, simply type
IGNORE by itself with no arguments, and it will show you your current ignore
list. To un-ignore someone, simply type UNIGNORE and then their name, they
will be removed from your list and you will be able to hear them again.
 
Specifics of IGNORE are that it will block that victim's tells.
The only thing you will still be able to hear is their SAYS and EMOTES.
Again, this command is similar to QUIET, only you can get specific with
whom you don't want to hear gabbing away, without having to sacrifice not
being able to hear anyone else.
~

1 'MOUNT' 'DISMOUNT'~
Syntax: MOUNT <victim>
        DISMOUNT
 
This skill allows one to mount a pet, and if successful, walk around any-
where in the world with it. Riding a mount will save the aching pain on
your feet, making travel much nicer. To get off your mount, simply type
Dismount. Pets available to mount, can only be bought. Mobiles found
wandering about the lands can NOT be mounted, even if charmed.
~

1 SPELLFILCHER~
Spellfilchers are dabblers or dilettantes; these jacks-of-all-trades are
usually spellcasters who have picked up their training informally or by
theft, or students of magecraft who quit their studies early.  A knowledge,
even imperfect or haphazard, of magic is of great use in the art of
thievery, and so many spellfilchers use their powers for personal gain.  The
magic which spellfilchers have managed to acquire (or steal, or stumble
into) tends towards illusion, evocation, or even bizarre, nameless powers
forgotten by the academies.  
~

0 NIGHTMARE~
Syntax: c 'nightmare'
 
Necromancers have the ability to conjure forth evil black
steeds. They have a fur coat the color of night and two blood red eyes
that glow brilliantly and eerily, thus giving it it's name, Nightmare.
Nightmare's are mountable creatures who's main purpose is to get their
master from place to place with ease. They are not very strong fighters
however, as they are not meant to be.
~

0 NECROMANCER~
Necromancers are mages who have specialized their study in the school of
necromancy.  Death is a part of the circle of magic and necromancers are the
experts in this knowledge.  As masters of death, unlife, pain, and disease,
these mages are known to wield magics so fearful that some have decreed
their art as illicit and downright blasphemous.  Rather than focusing on a
set of related schools of magic, the necromancer focuses solely on the art
of necromancy itself, delving into the other schools of magic to enhance
control over death and the destruction of life.  The morbidity of the
subject results in the art usually attracting those with a dark passion or
fascination with death.  Those who seek to master necromancy otherwise are
likely to be corrupted or driven insane.  
~

0 CONJUROR~
Conjurors are mages who have specialized their study in the related
schools of conjuration.  As masters of evocation, invokation, summoning, and
conjuration, these mages draw power from other planes and the natural world
in order to seemingly 'create' objects, creatures, and forces of energy. 
They are the most bold and spectacular of magicians, and are renowned for
the forces and elements which they command.  
~

0 'ILLUSION'~
Syntax: c 'illusion' <text> or <victim>

Although this spell may be cast on another player, the illsion is a waste
of mana. The main purpose of this spell is to give the caster the ability
to create an illusion of whatever the caster wants for everyone in the same
room to see. Think of this as sort of an ECHO command. The spell will not
be seen casted, so the inhabitants of the room will think of it as real.

An Example: cast 'illusion' The ground opens up beneath you, sucking you in!

When casting that illusion, all people in the room will only see:

The ground opens up beneath you, sucking you in!

This gives the illusion of that actually happening, when it didn't. This
spell is unlimited to what can be done, however, making it not look real,
using words in the text part that don't make sense, will also, not make
sense to the people in the room and instead will make you look like an
ass. Have fun with this spell, make your friends believe they're being
attacked, or make the illusion that a God came in and performed miracles
on everyone. Imagination required to use this spell!
~

0 ENCHANTER~
Enchanters are mages who have specialized their study in the related
schools of enchantment.  As masters of alteration, transmutation,
enchantment, and charm, these mages are known to shift reality to alter the
way existing creatures and objects exist in the prime material plane. 
Through their methods, they can bring both fantastical bennefits or
horrendous maledictions to those around them by enchanting and altering the
very fabic of being.  While not very bold, a cunning enchanter can wield
powers unmatched by any other.  
~

0 ANIMATE 'ANIMATE CORPSE'~
Syntax: cast 'animate corpse' <target, usually corpse>
 
One of the most famed abilities of necromancers is the ability to control
others in death.  Using this powerful incantation, a necromancer can
animate corpses and order them to do his bidding.  The necromancer is
always aware of the presence of the recently-departed spirit, however,

in progress.
~

0 DISPLACEMENT~

physical body during battle, giving the illusion that he or she is fading
in and out of existance, cutting the amount of times he may get hit

to start a fight.
~

0 'UNSEEN SERVANT'~
Syntax: cast 'unseen servant'
 
Conjuror's may summon forth an unseen servant to do their bidding. This
invisible and mindless form will perform simple tasks at the caster's

slow, almost comical.  
~

0 SYMPATHY~

1 CANTRIP~
Syntax: cast cantrip <type> <target, if applicable>

Cantrips are simple spells that magic users learn to practice their
skills.  Cantrips can create little objects or produce small effects,
but never damage, and nothing permanent.  There are many types of
cantrips, some of which magic-users learn about in their guilds.

Each guild teaches different cantrips, so by talking to people from
another magic guild may increase your knowledge of cantrips.  Also,
mages are known to keep written records of their favorite cantrips.
If you find such a scroll in your wanderings, and you know any other
cantrips, you'll be able to learn the new one.  Speak to your fellow
magic-users some of them may have researched a cantrip and submitted
it to immortal, resulting in a cantrip that only they know of.

If they are so inclined, they may share their knowledge with you.
Know that if you are a magic-user and wish to research a cantrip,
you may.  Note your research and the name of your new cantrip to
immortal.  If it is accepted, you'll have a cantrip all to
yourself, at least until you choose to share its secret. 
 
Thanks to the Turning Point for making this spell possible.

~

0 PICKPOCKET~
Syntax: pickpocket <container> <victim>

 An experienced thief can successfuly slip a hand into an unsuspecting
victim's pouch or bag and steal various items.  Because the contents are
concealed, the thief will automatically remove the top item from the
container, meaning he or she can not specify which item they want from
the container the victim is holding. If the victim's container is
closed, the first time pickpocket is used, it will merely open the
container first, then each successful attempt will retrieve items from
inside.
~

~

1 CALTROPS~

conditions. By digging a hole and tapping natural springs, the ranger can
find water essential for survival. This skill can only be used in
wilderness type areas.
~

0 CAMPFIRE~

A ranger can create a campfire in an outdoors setting with this skill.
This helps any person in the area to rest and sleep more confortably.   
To use a campfire effectively, one must sleep, sit, or rest at the campfire,
simply by typing commands such as 'sleep campfire', or 'rest campfire'.
Just standing in the same room with one burning will not do a person
any good. Also, even though only rangers may create a campfire, anyone
can re-kindle it, simply by typing campfire.
~

{x        cast 'disintegrate' <object>

This incantation allows a skilled necromancer to accelerate the rate of
death and decay almost instantaneously of the victim of his choice.
When cast upon an inanimate object or corpse, the effect is almost
instantaneous.  When cast upong a living being, however, the life-energy
within offers some protection, but the victim still suffers terrible
wounds due to pieces of his flesh decaying and disintegrating before
his very eyes.
~

0 'SPIRITUAL HAMMER'~
Syntax: cast 'spiritual hammer' <victim>

The caster uses his or her spirituality to smite foes.  The power of the
hammer is enough to knock down opponents in combat, as well as to dismount
enemies from their mounts.
~

102 'MP VARIABLE'~
------------------------------Variables------------------------------------
        To make things come alive, variables are needed.  These are
represented in the MOBprograms by using a dollar sign convention as in the
socials. When the mud command is processed, these variables are expanded
into the values shown below.

$i      the first of the names of the mobile itself.
$I      the short description of the mobile itself.
$n      the name of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$N      the name and title of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$t      the name of a secondary character target (i.e A smiles at B)
$T      the short description, or name and title of target (NPC vs PC)
$r      the name of a random PC in the room with the mobile
$R      the short description, or name and title of the random PC
$q      the name of the MOBprogram target (see MOB REMEMBER)
$Q      the short description of the MOBprogram target

$j      he,she,it based on sex of $i.
$e      he,she,it based on sex of $n.
$E      he,she,it based on sex of $t.
$J      he,she,it based on sex of $r.     

$k      him,her,it based on sex of $i.
$m      him,her,it based on sex of $n.
$M      him,her,it based on sex of $t.
$K      him,her,it based on sex of $r.

$l      his,hers,its based on sex of $i.
$s      his,hers,its based on sex of $n.
$S      his,hers,its based on sex of $t.
$L      his,hers,its based on sex of $r.

$o      the first of the names of the primary object (i.e A drops B)
$O      the short description of the primary object
$p      the first of the names of the secondary object (i.e A puts B in C)
$P      the short description of the secondary object

        Also, in if_checks, the accepted variables are the basic ones
(i,n,t,r,o,p,q).  If a variable is referenced that doesnt exist, then the
value is simply left blank or replaced with "someone"/"something" in
output (i.e referring to $o when the trigger is: A kisses B)

        If variable $q has not been defined, it is automatically set to the
last player that has triggered the program being executed (i.e. variable $n).
Once $q has been defined, it can be modified with MOB REMEMBER and MOB
FORGET commands in a program. Variable $q lets the mobile "remember" a player
across different programs, which can be useful. Note that $q is set
automatically only the FIRST TIME the mobile executes a program, every time
thereafter it must be set with MOB REMEMBER.

        The only problem with the variables is that the secondary object and
the secondary target are passed by act() in the same location.  This means that
if you reference $t in an  A puts B in C  situation, the result will probably
be a happy mud crash or some weird side effect, espescially if $t is used in
an if_check (i.e. if isnpc($t) in the above situation) The basic fix for this
is to change everyone who calls the act() procedure to specify a secondary
object and a secondary character. But that is a fairly comprehensive trivial
twiddle, so we left it the way it is so that, you arent forced to make all
those twiddles to use the MOBprograms.   
~

102 'MP IFCHECK'~
------------------------If_Checks In Control Flow---------------------------

        The provided list of if_checks and their arguments are below.  They
should all be fairly obvious in what they do, but some of the more obtuse
deserve a slight explanation. Any '==' operator can be replaced with any of
the available ones described above.  The argument $* refers to any of the
variables which make sense for that if_check (i.e. for an if_check which is
referencing a person the only valid variables would be $i, $n, $t, $r or $q)
A value type of string is a sequence of characters. It does not need to be
included in quotes or anything like that (i.e. if name $n fido )

There are five types of if checks:

Type 1: Keyword and value

rand      num              Is random percentage less than or equal to num
mobhere   vnum             Is a NPC with this vnum in the room
mobhere   name             Is a NPC with this name in the room

mobexists name             Does NPC 'name' exist somewhere in the world
objexists name             Does object 'name' exist somewhere in the world  
 
Type 2: Keyword, comparison and value

players    ==   integer    Is the number of PCs in the room equal to integer
mobs       ==   integer    Is the number of NPCs in the room equal to integer
clones     ==   integer    Is the number of NPCs in the room with the same
                             vnum as the NPC who activated the program equal
                             to integer
order      ==   integer    Is the order (of several similar NPCs) of the NPC
                             who activated the trigger equal to integer
hour       ==   integer    Is the hour (game time) equal to integer

Type 3: Keyword and actor

isvisible  $*              Is $* visible to NPC who activated the program
hastarget  $*              Does $* have a MOBprogram target in the room
istarget   $*              Is $* the target of NPC who activated the program

Type 4: Keyword, actor and value

sex        $*   == integer Is $*'s sex equal to integer
level      $*   == integer Is $*'s level equal to integer
align      $*   == integer Is $*'s alignment equal to integer
money      $*   == integer Does $* have money (in silver) equal to integer
objval#    $*   == integer Is $*->value[#] equal to integer (# from 0-4)

NOTE: The original MERC 2.2 MOBprograms used parenthesis '(' and ')'
around variables. In this version, they are not allowed. Also,parameters
MUST BE separated with spaces (if level $n<10 is NOT valid, correct syntax
is: if level $n < 10).
~

0 'MP EXAMPLE'~
In Medit
appmp (vnum) act 1000 pokes you in the ribs.
In mpedit:
if isnpc $n
   chuckle
   poke $n
   break
else
   if level $n <= 5
   or isgood $n
      tell $n I would rather you didnt poke me.
   else
      if level $n > 15
         scream
         say Ya know $n. I hate being poked!!!
         if mobhere guard
            mob force guard kill $n 
         endif
         kill $n
         break
      endif
      slap $n
      shout MOMMY!!! $N is poking me.
   endif
endif

Ok.. time to translate.. the trigger will only happen when the mobile
gets the message "... pokes you in the ..." If the offender (recall
the $n and $N refer to the char who did the poking...) is an NPC, then
the mobile merely chuckles and pokes back. If the offender was a PC
then good and low level characters get a warning, high level chars
get attacked, and midlevel chars get slapped and whined at.
Also, when attacking, the mobile will check if there are guards in the
room (if mobhere guard) and if one is found, it will be forced to
attack the player, too (mob force guard mob kill $n). Notice the
use of a MOBcommand "mob force".

Note that two of these mobiles could easily get into an infinite poke  
war which slows down (or frequently crashes) the mud just a bit :(
Be very careful about things like that if you can. (i.e dont respond
to a poke with a poke, and try not to let heavily programmed robot mobiles
wander around together. More on that is given above.)

Also, it is clear that the 'order' command could get confused with the 'or'
control flow. However, this is only the case when 'order' is abbreviated to
its two letter form, and placed immediately following an 'if' line. Thus,
if you want to be that malicious in trying to break the MOBprogram code,
noone is going to stand in your way (However, the result of this would be
a bug message and a bail out from the ifcheck so things dont really break)

Another example:

This program could be used on a temple guardian mobile, whose job is to
prevent evil characters from entering the sanctuary. Let's assume
the exit to the temple is north (exit 0) and the temple antechamber is
room 2301
In Medit

addmp exit 0

In MPedit   

if isgood $n
   say Hail!
   emote salutes $n.
   if carries $n holy
      mob transfer $n 2301
   else
      say If you wish to enter the temple, get a holy symbol.
   endif
else
   curse $n
   say Get lost, you scum!
endif

How this works: The trigger is activated when the player tries to exit
north from the room. If the player is of good alignment, the guard will
greet the player. However, the guard will not let the player to the
temple unless he or she carries a holy symbol. If the player is neutral
or evil, the guard will curse and block the way.

Example of using DELAY and REMEMBER:
 
In medit

addmp (vnum) greet 100
addmp (vnum) delay 100

In mpedit

if isevil $n
   say You infidel! Go away or face the wrath of mighty Mota!
   mob remember $n
   mob delay 10
   break
endif

--second mprog---
if hastarget $i
   growl
   mob echo $I screams and attacks $Q.
   mob kill $q
else
   mob forget 
endif

How this works: When the player enters a room, the mobile checks if the
player is evil. If this is the case, the mobile makes the player the
target (mob remember) and sets up a delay of 10 * PULSE_MOBILE.
When the delay expires, program #1003 is activated. The mobile checks
if the target is still in the room (hastarget), and if the player hasn't
left, the mobile attacks ($q and $Q refer to the target). If the player
has left, the mobile will forget the player (mob forget).

Example of MOB CALL:

In medit:

addmp (vnum) greet 100

In MPedit:

if isgood $n
   mob call 1005 $n null null
else       
   mob call 1006 $n null null
endif

-----------------------------
mob echo Suddenly, a bright aura surrounds $I!
mob cast 'heal' $n

------------------------------
mob echoat $n $I points $l finger at you in fury!
mob echoaround $I points $l finger at $N in fury!
mob cast 'curse' $n

MOBcommand argument_list           MOBcommand argument_list
~

0 RANGER~
Rangers are the vanguard of civilization.  They seek to subdue nature, to
blunt its harmful energies while protecting it from the ravages of
civilization.  Rangers are instrumental in charting new paths and roads
through great forests, discovering new mountain passes, and delving into the
great wastelands to find lost wonders and forgotten dangers.  These
explorers are at home in the wild, able to cook their own game and to build
campsites to live in nature.  Rangers possess many skills of the martial
arts which are unknown to city-trained warriors.  
~

0 'DRUID'~
Druids are the bane of civilization.  They seek to unleash nature, to
turn aside the devouring tide of cities, farms, and roads before they
destroy all the glories of nature; to this end they have conjured up strange
and terrible forces of creation, which give them mysterious and fearsome
magical powers.  Druids sometimes organize themselves into circles or
covens, commanding weird rituals of sacrifice in darkened forest glades.  It
is they who ensure that many lone travellers do not re-emerge from the
wilderness.  
~

102 NOTITLE~
Syntax: NOTITLE <player>

This command will toggle(change) the player's ability to have a "Special"
strung title.  All players, when created, start out with a PLR flag called
NOTITLE.  With this flag on, each time they level, they shall recieve a
pre-set title defined within our code structure.  Now, if someone has
roleplayed well, and an Immortal believes he or she should be awarded a
special title, then you must turn their NOTITLE flag off.  Typing in this
command followed by the player's name is all you need to do.  Only type it
in once.  Once you have removed their NOTITLE flag, you will then be able to
STRING a new title for them.  Once a new title is strung, DO NOT re-NOTITLE
them again.  This is a toggle command.  If you type it in again, after you
turned it off and gave them a special title, as soon as they level up,
they'll lose it.  So, once you take the flag off and string them that
special title, do nothing else.  With their special title, and the NOTITLE
flag OFF, they will continue to level throughout their remaining levels WITH
the special title.  This is as "Barney" as I can get.  If you have any
questions, first off, your dumb.  Second, please ask an Implimentor to help
you out.  
~

0 GOODBERRY~
Syntax: c 'goodberry'
 
This spell allows a Druid to create a delicious red berry to eat.
~

0 BADBERRY~
Syntax: c 'badberry'
 
This spell allows a Druid to create a berry which looks delicious on the
outside, but has painful effects when eaten, poisoning the victim.
~

0 'BARK SKIN'~
Syntax: c 'bark skin'
 
This spell allows it's caster to become covered in bark, giving him or her
added protection in battle. 
~

0 WINDSPIRIT~
Syntax: c 'windspirit' <victim>
 
The caster using this spell, summons a great gust of wind and
embodies it into either himself or his/her victim, increasing the
victim's speed for a great effect in battle.
~

0 STONESPIRIT~
Syntax: c 'stonespirit' <victim>
 
Calling upon the spirit of stone, this spell greatly increases
the victim's ability to regenerate their health.
~

0 'DRUIDSTAFF'~
Syntax: cast 'druidstaff'
 
This spell allows a skilled Druid to call upon Nature to create a special
weapon made of wood, to defend himself in battle. The weapon does not
make much for an offensive weapon, but will defend a Druid well, allowing
him or her enough time to escape, or find other means to win the battle.
It is said, that any Druid caught leaving one of these special weapons lying
around un-guarded by it's owner, that Branchala himself would appear and
have the Druid's head.
~

0 'NATURES WARMTH'~
Syntax: cast 'natures warmth'
 
This spell will give the caster the ability to heal double the speed of his
or her normal healing rate. This spell's source of power soley relies on the
elements of nature, so to cast this spell, one must be with nature. For the
spell to continue to work, one must stay with nature. Stepping out of it's
boundries will not allow the spell to work properly.
~

0 'NATURES EMBRACE'~
Syntax: cast 'natures embrace'
 
This spell will give its caster added protection in battle. However, due to
this spell's source of power, coming directly from nature, the caster must
be within nature (i.e. being in a forest or something of the like). To get
the full effect of this spell, the caster must remain within nature's
bounderies, else the spell will not work properly.
~

0 'BREATH OF NATURE'~
Syntax: cast 'breath of nature' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster, provided he or she is in a forest or some other
part of land where nature flourishes, the ability to heal himself or the
person this spell is cast upon.
~

0 EARTHMELD~
Syntax: cast 'earthmeld' <victim>
 
This spell is similar to mage's spell, gate, where it will take the
caster across the world if need be, as a means of faster transportation.
The caster will meld in with the ground, becoming a part of Nature itself,
then re-appearing as themselves at the end of their destination.
~

0 'SUMMON INSECTS'~
Syntax: cast 'summon insects'
 
This spell calls upon the insects from the realm of nature, to defend
the caster and attack any and all enemies around. Being too many insects
to control at one time, they sometimes will even attack
beings not involved with the fight, but will soon find themselves right
in the middle of it.
~

0 PILLIFY~
Syntax: pillify <spell name>
 
This skill will allow the person to create a pill out of a spell that he
or she knows. The complexity of this skill is great and most
of the time, the attempt to create a pill will fail.
~

0 BREW~
Syntax: brew <spell name>
 
This skill will allow a person to create their own vial, containing a spell
or spells in which they want to brew into it. Only spells you have gained
may be used to brew. To brew a spell, one must first, find an empty vial
or at least one that isn't already filled up with other spells. An empty
vial is easiest to brew a spell into. If or when it has 1 spell already
the next one will be harder to succeed. And even harder for a third spell.
~

0 SCRIBE~
Syntax: scribe <spell name>
 
This skill allows a person to scribe a spell into a scroll, or parchment.
The parchment must not already contain many spells, else the scribing will
never work properly. One must find empty parchments or scrolls in a shop and
then must hold the scroll to scribe the spell they wish to embue it with.
Spells that the person has gained are the only spells which will work.

-----------------------------The Basic Idea---------------------------------
{x    Ever wonder why most muds either seem dead or overcrowded? The answer
is probably partially due to the fact that the mobiles never do anything
but wait to be slaughtered.  Unless someone has gone to great lengths
and added many special procedures, most mobiles have no idea you are in
the room with them and rarely listen to what you say. The typical Midgaard
mayor wanders happily along even when the populace pokes him, waves his
City Key about, unlocks his gates, or frenchs his secretary, etc. So a way to
give the mobiles a bit more spirit would be neat. Enter the MOBprograms.
Ever wanted a room to trap someone?  Or an object to explode on contact?
Enter OBJ and ROOM progs.

TRIGGERS AND SCRIPTS
{x    The backbone of the Programs shall be called triggers from this
point on.  Essentially, they are procedure calls placed in sneaky places in
the mud code which provide the context for what is going on around the
mobile/object/room.  So, if something happens and a trigger is
activated, then a list of commands is sent to the interpreter in the
mobile/object/room's name, thus making her/it/him do an appropriate something.

VARIABLES
{x    Since knowing the appropriate response for everything to every
possible trigger is not easy, this command list shouldnt be a rigid script,
but needs to be somehow unique for the thing and the situation.  However, in
order to know the situation, a mobile/object/room needs to know more about the 
trigger than that it just happened. So, we have to include some sort of
variables
as well to set the context appropriately.
 
MOBPROGRAMS VS. SPEC_PROCS
{x    As most implementors know, most area creators are not versed in
coding, but usually have great ideas. Therefore, whatever system is used needs
to be quite simple. This is not to demean creators in anyway. Simply, it is
useless to have a powerful system, if the only person able to write anything
is someone who finds C coding in general to be exciting and non frustrating. 
If that is going to be the case, then stick to the special procedures, since
there is no bound to what a complex special procedure can accomplish. Yet,
from experience working on several muds, most admins and implementors prefer
not to be writing one shot spec_procs to satisfy the needs of their creators.
 
{x    Thus, the basic idea: let mobiles react to a myriad of mud
events/situations by having them perform a list of commands which can be
tailored to the moment through a simple and unintimidating scheme usable by
any creator.

---------------------------About Newt's Version-------------------------------

{x    My implementation of MOBprograms owes a lot to the original MOBprogram
code by Natasha. However, having heard reports about unstability of the code
supplied, and because the code seemed unnecessarily complex to me, I decided
to rewrite the MOBprogram driver. Admittedly, I have dropped out several
features that were present in the original version, such as reacting to
several triggers at once and string comparison in if_checks. On the other
hand, the MOBprogram code has been simplified and made more stable (there
are no memory leaks), and several new if_checks and MOBcommands have been
added. The system of linking MOBprograms to mobiles has been changed to allow
procedure-like calls.
 
{x    This version is an adaptation of my earlier MOBprogram system I
created for Imperium Gothique MUD. The IG system has object and room programs
as well, but I chose to omit them from this version.

102 MPSYNTAX OPSYNTAX RPSYNTAX~
Syntax---------------------------------------

{x    The simplest way to describe any syntax is by example, so here goes.
First, define the notation: anything contained in braces {} is required,
anything in brackets [] is optional, anything in quotes "" is a case
insensitive literal, NL refers to a required new-line. The meanings of
the labels used will be described following the syntax diagram.
{x    To use MOBprograms, you must add a #MOBPROGS section(s) to your area
file(s).  To use OBJprograms, you must add a #OBJPROGS section to your area
file(s).  To use ROOMprograms, you must add a #ROOMPROGS section to your area
file(s).

The syntax is identical for each program type, so only a MOBprog is given as 
the example here.

Section syntax:

#MOBPROGS
#{Vnum}
{program_command_1} NL
{program_command_2} NL
{program_command_3} NL
     .   .   .
{program_command_N} NL
"-" NL
     .   .   .

-- Explanations
A VNUM is the Program virtual number that identifies the program.  The
number must be unique across area files (like mobile and object vnums). 
A PROGRAM_COMMAND can be any legal mud command (unless is is an object 
or room program), or a control flow command.

NOTE 1: Any whitespaces (space, tab, newline) are NOT stripped from the
programs when loading the database (why? because I'm too damn lazy to have
implemented it). Thus, to save memory and execution time, omit all
unnecessary spaces from your Program scripts. If you must have
indentation, use TAB.
 
NOTE 2: Programs do NOT have to be in the same area file as the 
mobile/object/room definitions, since the programs are linked to the 
mobiles/objects/rooms after the database has been loaded. A Program can also 
be used as a subroutine (see MOB CALL, OBJ CALL, ROOM CALL commands) without 
having to be linked to any mobile/object/room.

-- MOBprogram Example
#MOBPROGS
#3001
say Hey, no loitering!
poke $n
-

-- OBJprogram Example
#OBJPROGS
#3001
obj echo spikes shoot out of $i, impailing your hands!
obj damage $n 50 50
-
 
-- ROOMprogram Example
#ROOMPROGS
#3001
room echo A bright light flashes and you find yourself in a different place.
room transfer $n 3054
room force $n look
-

102 MPLINKING OPLINKING RPLINKING~
--------------------------Linking Programs--------------------------------

{x    Once you've written your Programs, you must link the programs
to appropriate mobiles/objects/rooms. In the #MOBILES section, for each mobile
you wish to have a MOBprogram, add lines of the following type to the end of
the mobile definition:

{x    "M" {Keyword} {Vnum} {Argument}- NL

For Objects:
{x    "O" {Keyword} {Vnum} {Argument}- NL

For Rooms:
{x    "R" {Keyword} {Vnum} {Argument}- NL

--Explanations
The KEYWORD is a single word, see below for explanations.
The VNUM is the Program virtual number.
The ARGUMENT is the argument that triggers the event.
--Example
 
M act 3001 sits down-

In the above example, an ACT trigger is defined. When the mobile sees
someone sitting down in the room, the mobile will execute program number
3001 (defined in #MOBPROGS section).

Objects and rooms will react to anyone preforming the act regardless of there
visibility status.  Immortals be careful, as of this writing, they don't check
to see if you're wizi (consult the README to see any changes made after this
writing).

NOTE: Several mobiles can use the same MOBprogram, i.e. MOBprograms can be
SHARED with several mobiles. The keyword and trigger argument can be different
for each mobile even if they share the same MOBprogram code.  Likewise for the
objects and rooms.
~

102 MPTRIGGER OPTRIGGER RPTRIGGER~
-----------------------------Trigger Types----------------------------------

	Here's a summary of triggers:

	Triggers are fairly easy to add, but this basic list should hold for
most needs. Their names, argument list syntaxes, and translation into 
more articulate english are given below:

ACT

Program types: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword	: 'act'
Argument: string

	The argument is a phrase, a text string. The trigger is activated
whenever the phrase is contained in the	act() message.

NOTE:  	Most general trigger. Applies to almost every event which happens
	in the mud. Anytime the function act() is called with a message
	to be delivered TO_CHAR,TO_VICT,TO_ROOM,etc. the act can be
	triggered.  Basically this will trigger on almost everything
	you'll ever want. Output of "say", "shout" and "emote" do not
	trigger this event.

SPEECH

Program types: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'speech'
Argument: string

NOTE:  	This is only triggered when the phrase is contained in a
	message which has been said by a PC in the same room as the mob/obj/room.
	The PC restriction is not necessary, but makes infinite loops
	between two talking mobiles impossible. It also makes it impossible
	for two NPC's to stand and discuss the weather however. 

RANDOM

Program types: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'random'
Argument: number

	The argument is a number betweeen 0 and 99 inclusive.

NOTE:  	This trigger is checked at each PULSE_MOBILE and if the argument is
	greater than a percentage roll the trigger is activated. This
	will happen even if there is no PC in the room with the mob/object/room,
	but there must be players in the same area. 
	It is useful to give mobiles a bit of a personality. For instance
	a janitor who stops to spit tobacco, or complain about the hours,
	or wonder why there are no woman janitors on muds, or a fido which
	barks or growls or pees on the curb is much more alive than one
	which just sits there scavenging.
	Note that this trigger is checked only when there are players in
	the area. If you want this event to be triggered always, you must
	set the ACT_UPDATE_ALWAYS flag of the mobile.

	This trigger for objects is checked at each PULSE_TICK, and for rooms at
	each PULSE_AREA.

GREET/GREET ALL

Program types: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'greet'
Argument: number

	Again a percentage argument.

NOTE:  	Whenever someone enters the room with the mobile/object/room, and 
	the mobile saw the person enter, this is checked. Good for shopkeepers 
	who want to welcome customers, or for pseudo-aggressive mobiles which need to
	discriminate on who they attack.
	Greet trigger activates only when the mobile is not busy (fighting,
	sitting, sleeping etc.). If you want to be sure to catch all players,
	use grall.

	Objects and rooms will always fire on this trigger regardless of the PC's 
	visibility status.

Program types: MOB
Keyword : 'grall'
Argument: number

	Again a percentage argument.

NOTE:  	Like greet, but it can be triggered even if the mobile didn't
	see the	arrival (i.e. sneak, invis, etc) or is busy. Most useful for
	faking teleport rooms or for impassable guardians.
	
ENTRY

Program types: MOB
Keyword : 'entry'
Argument: number

	Again a percentage argument.

NOTE:  	The opposite of greet trigger. Whenver the mobile itself enters a new
	room, this can be triggered.  Useful for looking around, or waving
	or other things that real PCs do when they arrive at a crowded room.
	IMPORTANT: In an entry program, the mobile can only refer to a
	random pc ($r in if checks) -- there's no way to know how many PCs
	exist in the room the mobile enters! Also, you must check visibility
	of the target in your program.

EXIT/EXIT ALL

Program types: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'exit'
Argument: number

	Argument is the exit number (0:north, 1:east, 2:south 3:west etc.)

NOTE:  	The opposite of entry trigger. This is activated when PC tries to
	leave a room through an exit indicated by the argument, and the
	mobile/object/room sees the person leave. Useful for having a single guardian to
	watch several exits. An exit trigger works better than an entry
	trigger, since you can refer to a specific PC instead of a random PC.
	IMPORTANT: If this event is triggered, the victim will not move
	through the exit. If necessary, you must move the character yourself
	in your program (see MOB/OBJ/ROOM TRANSFER/MOB/OBJ/ROOM GTRANSFER). Also, 
	this event is not triggered when a character flees from combat or the mobile
	is not in its default position.

	Objects and rooms will always fire on this trigger regardless of the PC's
	visibility status.

Program types: MOB
Keyword : 'exall'
Argument: number

	Argument is the exit number (0 = north etc.)

	The same as exit trigger, but it can be triggered even if the
	mobile cannot see the person trying to leave the room or if
	the mobile is busy.

GIVE 

Program types: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'give'
Argument: string or object vnum

	The argument is either the a string containing words to be
	matched against the keywords of the object, or the word "all";
	e.g. argument "long sword" will match to objects "long bow" and
	"small sword".
	Alternatively, the argument can be the virtual number of a single
	object.

MOB NOTE:  	This is triggered whenever something is given to the mobile.  Best
	used for quests.  Since the first successful trigger is the only one
	of this type which is processed, having an "all" argument in the
	script at the end of the MOBprogram list is essentially a default
	response.

OBJ NOTE:   This is triggered whenever the object is given to someone else.
	Also, the argument is ignored in this case.

ROOM NOTE:  This is triggered whenever the object (according to argument) is 
	given to someone in the room.

GET

Program types: OBJ, ROOM
Keyword: 'get'
Argument: string or object vnum

	The argument is either a string containing words to be matched against
	the keywords of the object, or the word "all"; e.g. argument "long sword"
	will match to objects "long bow" and "small sword".
	Alternatively, the argument can be the virtual number of a single object.

OBJ NOTE: Fires whenever the object is picked up, argument is ignored.

ROOM NOTE: Fires whenever the object (according to argument) is picked up in the room.

DROP

Program types: OBJ, ROOM
Keyword: 'drop'
Argument: string or object vnum

	The argument is either a string containing words to be matched against
	the keywords of the object, or the word "all"; e.g. argument "long sword"
	will match to objects "long bow" and "small sword".
	Alternatively, the argument can be the virtual number of a single object.

OBJ NOTE: Fires whenever the object is dropped, argument is ignored.

ROOM NOTE: Fires whenever the object (according to argument) is dropped in the room.
BRIBE

Program types: MOB
Keyword : 'bribe'
Argument: number

	The argument is any positive integer number.

NOTE:  	This trigger is activated whenever money is given to the mobile.
	If the amount given exceeds the number, then process the commands.
	Note again, that an argument of '1' would act as a default response.
	Also note that if the script is not triggered (because of too little
	money having been given), the mobile still keeps the money...

	ROM 2.4 NOTE: Since ROM 2.4 has two different types of currency
	(gold and silver coins), for bribe trigger the amount to be given
	is converted to silver coins with the rate of 1 gold = 100 silver.
	Thus, the number in the argument should be the expected amount in
	silver coins.

KILL

Program type: MOB
Keyword : 'kill'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percent once again.

NOTE:  	This trigger is checked whenever a PC attacks the mobile. The check
	occurs only ONCE, in the beginning of combat. Useful for summoning
	assistance etc. (See MOB MLOAD).

FIGHT

Program type: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'fight'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percentage.

MOB NOTE:  	Useful for giving mobiles combat attitude. It is checked every
	PULSE_VIOLENCE when the mobile is fighting. Can be used to cast
	spells (see MOB CAST), curse at the opponent, or whatever. Only the
	first successful one will be processed to save time.  Also, this
	means that the mobile wont get lucky and 1. curse, cast a fireball
	and 2. spit on the player, cast another fireball in the same pulse.

OBJ NOTE:	Fires when the object is worn when the player wearing it is fighting.
		Targets the opponent.  Checked every PULSE_VIOLENCE.

ROOM NOTE:	Fires when there is a fight going on in the room.  Targets the first
		person fighting.  Checked every PULSE_VIOLENCE.

HIT POINT PERCENTAGE

Program type: MOB
Keyword : 'hpcnt'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percentage.

NOTE:  	Is activated at each PULSE_VIOLENCE when the mobile is fighting. It
	checks to see if the hitpoints of the mobile are below the given
	percentage. Multiple hpcnt triggers should be listed in increasing
	order of percent since a 40% will always be activated before a 20%
	and, only the first successful trigger is performed. (See also
	MOB FLEE).

DEATH

Program type: MOB
Keyword : 'death'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percent once again.

NOTE:  	When the mobile dies, if the random percentage is less than the
	argument the mobile performs the MOBprogram commands rather than the
	usual death_cry() sequence.  This is done before the corpse is made,
	so the commands can be considered the mobiles last gasp. It could
	perhaps	destroy the items it was holding (see MOB REMOVE and MOB
	JUNK), or create some (see MOB OLOAD), or cast a spell (see MOB
	CAST) on the killer and the room, or even goto a new location (see
	MOB GOTO) and die there (with a text message, the corpse would seem
	to vanish) The position of the mobile is set to STANDING, and so it
	can do all the normal commands, without worrying about being DEAD.
	However, even if the mobile restores itself to full hitpoints, it
	will still die.
	This is not a way to immortal mobiles. However, the last thing this
	mobile does could be to goto some vacant room, load a fresh version
	of itself, drop all its items, force the new mobile to get all the
	items and wear them, send the new mobile back to the character who
	killed it and force the new mobile to attack that character. Along
	with a text message which said the mobile restored itself, this
	might be a convincing effect. (Note that your kitten could turn into
	a dragon this way too).


DELAY

Program type: MOB, OBJ, ROOM
Keyword : 'delay'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percentage chance.

NOTE:  	This trigger activates when the delay of a mobile/object/room (set 
	with the MOB/OBJ/ROOM DELAY command) expires. This trigger can be used 
	to create staged mobile/object/room behavior, for example, a guardian could 
	see a player entering a room, give a warning and activate a delay.
	If the player is still present when the delay expires, the
	guard would attack the player. (See also MOB REMEMBER).
	A mobile/object/room can have several delay triggers, but every time the
	delay timer expires, all the triggers are checked and the first
	successful one executed.

SURRENDER

Program type: MOB
Keyword : 'surr'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percentage.

NOTE:	This trigger activates when the mobile is fighting and the
	opponent issues a "surrender" command. When triggered, both parties
	will cease fighting, and the mobile can accept the surrender
	(perhaps taking all equipment from the character with MOB REMOVE).
	Note that if the mobile does not accept the surrender, it must
	resume fighting with MOB KILL.
	If a character surrenders and the mobile does not have a surrender
	trigger, or the trigger does not activate, the fight resumes
	normally.

SIT

Program type: OBJ
Keyword: 'sit'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percentage.

NOTE:	This trigger activates when the object is sat on/in/at, rested on/in/at,
	slept on/in/at, or stood on/in/at.


NOTE: No MOBprograms will be successful when the mobile is charmed
(since it has no self volition, it should act like it has none) to protect
mobiles which are given special powers from being implemented by a player.
~

102 MPVARIABLE OPVARIABLE RPVARIABLE~
------------------------------Variables------------------------------------

To make things come alive, variables are needed.  These are
represented in the Programs by using a dollar sign convention as in the
socials. When the mud command is processed, these variables are expanded into
the values shown below. Usually, it is best to use the short descriptions
of mobiles and the names of players when speaking them, but if you are
performing an action to someone almost always you want the name. The
title field for players is an extra that probably wont often be used.
Without further hesitation... the variables:

$i    the first of the names of the mobile/object itself (doesn't work on rooms).
$I    the short description of the mobile/object itself or name of room.
$n    the name of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$N    the name and title of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$t    the name of a secondary character target (i.e A smiles at B)
$T    the short description, or name and title of target (NPC vs PC)
$r    the name of a random PC in the room
$R    the short description, or name and title of the random PC
$q    the name of the Program target (see MOB/OBJ/ROOM REMEMBER)
$Q    the short description of the Program target
 
$j    he,she,it based on sex of $i (doesn't work with rooms).
$e    he,she,it based on sex of $n.
$E    he,she,it based on sex of $t.
$J    he,she,it based on sex of $r.

$k    him,her,it based on sex of $i (doesn't work with rooms).
$m    him,her,it based on sex of $n.
$M    him,her,it based on sex of $t.
$K    him,her,it based on sex of $r.

$l    his,hers,its based on sex of $i (doesn't work with room).
$s    his,hers,its based on sex of $n.
$S    his,hers,its based on sex of $t.
$L    his,hers,its based on sex of $r.

$o    the first of the names of the primary object (i.e A drops B)
$O    the short description of the primary object
$p    the first of the names of the secondary object (i.e A puts B in C)
$P    the short description of the secondary object
 
{x    Also, in if_checks, the accepted variables are the basic ones
(i,n,t,r,o,p,q).  If a variable is referenced that doesnt exist, then the
value is simply left blank or replaced with "someone"/"something" in
output (i.e referring to $o when the trigger is: A kisses B)

{x    If variable $q has not been defined, it is automatically set to the
last player that has triggered the program being executed (i.e. variable $n).
Once $q has been defined, it can be modified with REMEMBER and
FORGET commands in a program. Variable $q lets the mobile/object/room
"remember" a player across different programs, which can be useful. Note tha
$q is set automatically only the FIRST TIME the mobile/object/room executes a
program, every time thereafter it must be set with a REMEMBER command.
 
{x    The only problem with the variables is that the secondary object and
the secondary target are passed by act() in the same location.  This means
that if you reference $t in an  A puts B in C  situation, the result will
probably be a happy mud crash or some weird side effect, espescially if $t is
used in an if_check (i.e. if isnpc($t) in the above situation) The basic fix
for this is to change everyone who calls the act() procedure to specify a
secondary object and a secondary character. But that is a fairly comprehensive
trivial twiddle, so we left it the way it is so that, you arent forced to make all those twiddles to use the Programs.
 
~

102 MPCONTROL OPCONTROL RPCONTROL~
---------------------------Control Flow Syntax------------------------------

{x    Flow of control commands may also be used in the programs. Here is the
syntax for a flow of control command.
The parts between [ and ] are optional.

"if" " " {if_check_1} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL
[ "or" " " {if_check_2} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
[ "or" " " {if_check_N} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]

[ "and" " " {if_check_N} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
[ "and" " " {if_check_N} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]

{x    [ {program_command_1} NL ]
{x    [ {program_command_2} NL ]

{x    [ "break" NL ]

{x    [ {program_command_N} NL ]
[ "else" NL ]
{x    [ {program_command_1} NL ]
{x    [ {program_command_2} NL ]

{x    [ "break" NL ]

{x    [ {program_command_N} NL ]
 
"endif" NL

{x    Basically, it is: an 'if' line, followed by zero or more 'or' lines,
followed by zero of more 'and' lines ('and' and 'or' lines can be in any
order) followed by zero or more legal mud commands, which may contain a
'break' line, possibly followed by an 'else' line , followed by zero or more
legal mud commands, which may contain a 'break' line, followed by an 'endif'
line.

The only new syntax labels are all in the IF/OR/AND line:

--Explanations

An IF_CHECK is a string which describes under what context to compare things.
The ARGUMENT is the reference point from which the LHS of an expression comes.
The OPERATOR indicates how the LHS and RHS are going to be compared.
The VALUE is the RHS of the expression to be compared by the operator.

The BREAK command bails out of the entire Program regardless of the
level if nesting. (END is a synonym for BREAK).

If that looks confusing, skip to the end of the document and review the
examples. Hopefully that should clear things, otherwise you'll probably have
to give me a mail since examples are the best way I know to explain syntax.
~

102 MPOPERATORS OPOPERATORS RPOPERATORS~
--------------------------------Operators-----------------------------------

{x    Most of the basic numeric operators are legal and perform the same
function as in C.

Operators: == != > < >= <=
 
Where:
 
== means first <x> is equal to the second <x>
== means first <x> is equal to the second <x>
>  means first <x> is greater than the second <x>
<  means first <x> is less than the second <x>
>= means first <x> is greater than OR equal to the second <x>
<= means first <x> is less than OR equal to the second <x>
 
~

102 MPIFCHECKS OPIFCHECKS RPIFCHECKS~
------------------------If_Checks In Control Flow---------------------------

{x    The provided list of if_checks and their arguments are below.  They
should all be fairly obvious in what they do, but some of the more obtuse
deserve a slight explanation. Any '==' operator can be replaced with any of
the available ones described above.  The argument $* refers to any of the
variables which make sense for that if_check (i.e. for an if_check which is
referencing a person the only valid variables would be $i, $n, $t, $r or $q)
A value type of string is a sequence of characters. It does not need to be
included in quotes or anything like that (i.e. if name $n fido ).  The
if_checks work for all types of programs unless otherwise noted.

There are five types of if checks:

Type 1: Keyword and value

rand      num{x            Is random percentage less than or equal to num
mobhere   vnum{x           Is a NPC with this vnum in the room

money      $*  == integer Does $* have money (in silver) equal to integer
objval#    $*  == integer Is $*->value[#] equal to integer (# from 0-4)

NOTE: The original MERC 2.2 MOBprograms used parenthesis '(' and ')'
around variables. In this version, they are not allowed. Also,parameters
MUST BE separated with spaces (if level $n<10 is NOT valid, correct syntax
is: if level $n < 10).
 
~

102 MPCOMMANDS~
------------------------New Commands Of Interest-----------------------------

1. GENERAL COMMANDS

Syntax: SURRENDER
{x    This command can be issued in combat. If the one giving the command
{x    is a PC and the opponent is a NPC, the NPC will be checked for
{x    a surrender trigger. If the trigger activates, the fight will be
{x    terminated. Otherwise the combat will resume normally. Note that
{x    the mobile can resume the combat in the MOBprogram (see MOB KILL).
{X    If anyone (PC or NPC) surrenders to a PC, the combat will terminate.
{x    The PC can resume the combat with 'kill' command.
{x    With this command, and the use of surrender trigger, non-lethal
{x    combat can be implemented (arenas etc.).

2. DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS
	
{x    These two new commands are available to immortal players.


Syntax:  MPSTAT [mobile]

{x    Displays the triggers and MOBprogram vnums defined for the mobile.

Syntax:  MPDUMP [vnum]

{x    Displays the MOBprogram code of given vnum.

3. MOBCOMMANDS

{x    MOBcommands are special commands that allow mobiles to perform
immortal-like actions within a MOBprogram (transferring players or loading
items, for example). Most MOBcommands them are wiz commands which have been
changed to allow for mobiles to perform the commands. In this version of
Programs, players have been prevented from using these commands by adding
a separate interpreter for MOBcommands. This also speeds up (in most cases)
MOBprogram execution when MOBcommands are used. All MOBcommands are
preceded with the word 'MOB' on the command line.

Syntax:  MOB ASOUND [string]
	 MOB ZECHO  [string]
	 MOB GECHO  [string]

	ASOUND prints the text string to the rooms around the mobile in the
	same manner as a death cry. This is really useful for powerful
	aggressives and is also nice for wandering minstrels or mobiles like
	that in concept.
	ZECHO prints the string to all players in the same area with the
	mobile. GECHO prints the string to all players in the game.

Syntax:  MOB ECHO                 [string]
	 MOB ECHOAT      [victim] [string]
	 MOB ECHOAROUND  [victim] [string]

	ECHO displays the string to everyone in the room. ECHOAT displays
	the string to the victim only. ECHOAROUND displays the string to
	everyone except the victim.
	The three options let you tailor the message to goto victims or to do
	things sneaky like having a merchant do: 
	mob at guard mob echoat guard rescue_please 
	This coupled with a guard act trigger on rescue_please to:
	mob goto $n
	mob echo $I has arrived.
	It is an affective way of quickly bringing guards to the scene of
	an attack. (Note that the merchant has to be the only one of its
	kind in the game or have a unique name, otherwise the guard might
	go to different mobile...).
	

Syntax:  MOB MLOAD [vnum]
	 MOB OLOAD [vnum] [level] {'room'|'wear'}

        MLOAD creates a mobile and places it in the same room with the
	mobile.
	OLOAD loads the object into the inventory of the mobile. Even if the
	item is non-takable, the mobile will receive it in the inventory.
	This lets a mobile distribute a quest item or load a key or something.
	The optional 3rd parameter can be specified; 'room' means to load
	the object to the room, 'wear' means to force the mobile to wear
	the object loaded (useful for equipping mobiles on the fly).

Syntax:  MOB KILL [victim]

	Lets a mobile kill a player without having to murder. Lots of
	MOBprograms end up with mpkill $n commands floating around. It
	works on both mobiles and players.

Syntax:  MOB FLEE

	Causes a mobile to unconditionally flee from combat. Can be used
	for example with the hit point percentage trigger to simulate
	"wimpy" behavior.

Syntax:  MOB REMOVE [victim] [vnum|'all']

	Lets the mobile to strip an object of given vnum from the victim.
	Objects removed are destroyed. If the vnum is replaced with "all",
	the whole inventory of the victim is destroyed. This command is
	probably most useful for extracting quest items from a player
	after a quest has been completed.


Syntax:  MOB JUNK [object]

	Destroys the object refered to in the mobile's inventory. It prints
	no message to the world and you can do things like junk all.bread or
	junk all. This is nice for having janitor mobiles clean out their
	inventory if they are carrying too much (have a MOBprogram trigger on
	the 'full inventory')

Syntax:  MOB PURGE [argument]

	Destroys the argument from the room of the mobile. Without an argument
	the result is the cleansing of all NPC's and items from the room with
	the exception of the mobile itself.  However, mppurge $i will indeed
	purge the mobile, but it MUST be the last command the mobile tries to
	do, otherwise the mud cant reference the acting mobile trying to do the
	commands and bad things happen.  

Syntax:  MOB AT [location] [command]

	Perfoms the command at the designated location. Very useful for doing
	magic slight of hand tricks that leave players dumbfounded.. such as
	metamorphing mobiles, or guard summoning, or corpse vanishing.

Syntax:  MOB GOTO [location]

	Moves the mobile to the room or mobile or object requested. It makes
	no message of its departure or of its entrance, so these must be
	supplied with echo commands if they are desired.

Syntax:  MOB TRANSFER  [victim|'all'] [location]
	 MOB GTRANSFER [victim]       [location]
	 MOB OTRANSFER [object]       [location]

	Sends the victim to the destination or to the room of the mobile as a
	default.  if the victim is "all" then all the characters in the room
	of the mobile are transfered to the destination.  Good for starting
	quests or things like that.  There is no message given to the player
	that it has been transfered and the player doesnt do a look at the
	new room unless the mob forces them to.
	Gtransfer works like transfer, except that the group the victim
	belongs	to is transferred with the victim. Otransfer transfers an
	object in the room.

Syntax:  MOB FORCE  [victim|'all'] [command]
	 MOB GFORCE [victim]       [command]
	 MOB VFORCE [vnum]         [command]

	Forces the victim to do the designated command. The victim is not told
	that they are forced, they just do the command so usually some mpecho
	message is nice.  You can force players to remove belongings and give
	them to you, etc.  The player sees the normal command messages (such as
	removing the item and giving it away in the above example)  Again, if
	the victim is "all" then everyone in the mobiles room does the command.
	Gforce works like force except that it affects the group the victim
	belongs to.
	Vforce affects all mobiles with given vnum in the game world. This
	is useful for, for example, purging certain type of NPCs from the
	game (by forcing them to purge themselves).

Syntax:  MOB CAST [spell] [victim]

	Lets the mobile to cast spells. Beware, this does only crude validity
	checking and does not use up any mana. All spells are available
	regardless of the race or other abilities of the mobile. Casting the
	spell occurs silently, but spell effects are displayed normally.

Syntax:  MOB DAMAGE [victim|'all'] [min] [max] {lethal}

	Causes unconditional damage to the victim. Specifying "all" as
	victim causes damage to all characters in the room except the mobile.
	Min and max parameters define the minimum and maximum amounts of
	damage caused. By default, the damage is non-lethal, but by supplying
	the optional 'lethal' parameter, the damage can kill the victim.
	This command is silent, you must echo all messages yourself in the
	program. Useful for implementing special attacks for mobiles.

Syntax:  MOB DELAY
	 MOB CANCEL

	MOB DELAY sets the time in PULSE_MOBILE after which the mobile's
	delay trigger is activated. If the mobile has a program defined
	for delay trigger, the program is executed when the timer expires.
	MOB CANCEL resets the delay timer.

Syntax:  MOB REMEMBER [victim]
	 MOB FORGET

	This command enables the mobile to remember a player for future
	reference in a MOBprogram. The player can subsequently be referred
	as '$q' in programs activated by the mobile. MOB FORGET clears
	the target. Note that if the first time the mobile runs a program,
	$q is automatically set to the player who triggered the event.
	Most commonly this command is used in delayed programs, where the
	mobile has to remember the player who triggered the original
	event, for example to continue conversation.

Syntax:  MOB CALL [vnum] {victim} {target1} {target2}

	This command lets you call MOBprograms from within a running one,
	i.e. to call a MOBprogram subroutine. The first parameter is the
	vnum of the program to execute, the second is the victim's name
	(for example $n), and the third and fourth are optional object
	names. All other parameters except vnum can be replaced with
	word 'null' indicating ignored parameter.
	MOBprograms can be called recursively, but as a safety measure,
	parser allows only 5 recursions.

102 OPCOMMANDS~
------------------------New Commands Of Interest-----------------------------

1. DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS
	
{x    These two new commands are available to immortal players.
Syntax: OPSTAT [object]
{x    Displays the triggers and OBJprogam vnums defined for the object.

Syntax: OPDUMP [vnum]
{x    Displays the OBJprogram code of given vnum.

2. OBJCOMMANDS

	OBJcommands are special commands that allow objects to perform
immortal-like actions within an OBJprogram (transferring players or loading
items, for example). Most OBJcommands them are wiz commands which have been
changed to allow for objects to perform the commands. In this version of
Programs, players have been prevented from using these commands by adding
a separate interpreter for OBJcommands. This also speeds up (in most cases)
MOBJprogram execution when OBJcommands are used. All OBJcommands are
preceded with the word 'OBJ' on the command line.


Syntax:  OBJ ZECHO  [string]
	     OBJ GECHO  [string]

	ZECHO prints the string to all players in the same area with the
	object. GECHO prints the string to all players in the game.

Syntax:  OBJ ECHO                 [string]
	 OBJ ECHOAT      [victim] [string]
	 OBJ ECHOAROUND  [victim] [string]

	ECHO displays the string to everyone in the room. ECHOAT displays
	the string to the victim only. ECHOAROUND displays the string to
	everyone except the victim.
	The three options let you tailor the message to goto victims or do other
	sneaky stuff:).

Syntax:  OBJ MLOAD [vnum]
	 OBJ OLOAD [vnum] [level]

        MLOAD creates a mobile and places it in the same room with the
	object.
	OLOAD loads the object into the room.

Syntax:  OBJ REMOVE [victim] [vnum|'all']

	Lets the object strip an object of given vnum from the victim.
	Objects removed are destroyed. If the vnum is replaced with "all",
	the whole inventory of the victim is destroyed. 

Syntax:  OBJ PURGE [argument]

	Destroys the argument from the room of the object. Without an argument
	the result is the cleansing of all NPC's and items from the room with
	the exception of the object itself.  However, mppurge $i will indeed
	purge the object, but it MUST be the last command the object tries to
	do, otherwise the mud cant reference the acting object trying to do the
	commands and bad things happen.  

Syntax:  OBJ GOTO [location]

	Moves the object to the room or mobile or object requested. It makes
	no message of its departure or of its entrance, so these must be
	supplied with echo commands if they are desired.

Syntax:  OBJ TRANSFER  [victim|'all'] [location]
	 OBJ GTRANSFER [victim]       [location]
	 OBJ OTRANSFER [object]       [location]

	Sends the victim to the destination or to the room of the object as a
	default.  if the victim is "all" then all the characters in the room
	of the object are transfered to the destination.  Good for starting
	quests or things like that.  There is no message given to the player
	that it has been transfered and the player doesnt do a look at the
	new room unless the object forces them to.
	Gtransfer works like transfer, except that the group the victim
	belongs	to is transferred with the victim. Otransfer transfers an
	object in the room.

Syntax:  OBJ FORCE  [victim|'all'] [command]
	 OBJ GFORCE [victim]       [command]
	 OBJ VFORCE [vnum]         [command]

	Forces the victim to do the designated command. The victim is not told
	that they are forced, they just do the command so usually some opecho
	message is nice.  You can force players to remove belongings and drop them,
	etc.  The player sees the normal command messages (such as
	removing the item and dropping it in the above example)  Again, if
	the victim is "all" then everyone in the object's room does the command.
	Gforce works like force except that it affects the group the victim
	belongs to.
	Vforce affects all mobiles with given vnum in the game world. This
	is useful for, for example, purging certain type of NPCs from the
	game (by forcing them to purge themselves).

Syntax:  OBJ DAMAGE [victim|'all'] [min] [max] {lethal}

	Causes unconditional damage to the victim. Specifying "all" as
	victim causes damage to all characters in the room.
	Min and max parameters define the minimum and maximum amounts of
	damage caused. By default, the damage is non-lethal, but by supplying
	the optional 'lethal' parameter, the damage can kill the victim.
	This command is silent, you must echo all messages yourself in the
	program.

Syntax:  OBJ DELAY
	 OBJ CANCEL

	OBJ DELAY sets the time in PULSE_TICK after which the object's
	delay trigger is activated. If the object has a program defined
	for delay trigger, the program is executed when the timer expires.
	OBJ CANCEL resets the delay timer.


Syntax:  OBJ REMEMBER [victim]
	 OBJ FORGET

	This command enables the object to remember a player for future
	reference in a OBJprogram. The player can subsequently be referred
	as '$q' in programs activated by the object. OBJ FORGET clears
	the target. Note that if the first time the object runs a program,
	$q is automatically set to the player who triggered the event.
	Most commonly this command is used in delayed programs, where the
	object has to remember the player who triggered the original
	event.

Syntax:  OBJ CALL [vnum] {victim} {target1} {target2}

	This command lets you call OBJprograms from within a running one,
	i.e. to call a OBJprogram subroutine. The first parameter is the
	vnum of the program to execute, the second is the victim's name
	(for example $n), and the third and fourth are optional object
	names. All other parameters except vnum can be replaced with
	word 'null' indicating ignored parameter.
	OBJprograms can be called recursively, but as a safety measure,
	parser allows only 5 recursions.

Syntax:  OBJ ATTRIB [target] [level] [condition] [v0] [v1] [v2] [v3] [v4]

	This command will change the object's stats to those specified.
	The target argument is the character who's level you want to compare,
	each other argument corresponds to the object stat with that name.
	All arguments must be included, see following list for details on
	argument options.

	Target may be a $ code or if you put "worn" as the argument, it will
	target the character that is wearing the object.

	Each of the other arguments must be an integer value, if you want to
	compare against the target's level, at an operator (+,-,*,/) just
	before the number with no space.
	EXAMPLE:
	    obj attrib worn 20 *3 /2 +5 -14 8 8

	In this case the target will be the character wearing the object.
	The object's level will be set to 20,
	object's condition will be set to the target's level * 3,
	object's v0 will be set to the target's level / 2,
	object's v1 will be set to the target's level + 5,
	object's v2 will be set to the target's level -14,
	objects v3 and v4 will both be set to 8

102 RPCOMMANDS~
------------------------New Commands Of Interest-----------------------------

1. DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS
	
{x    These two new commands are available to immortal players.

Syntax: RPSTAT [vnum]
{x    Displays the triggers and ROOMprogram vnums defined for the room vnum.
{x    If no vnum is given, it shows the information for the current room.

Syntax: RPDUMP [vnum]
{x    Displays the ROOMprogram code of given vnum. 

2. ROOMCOMMANDS

	ROOMcommands are special commands that allow rooms to perform
immortal-like actions within a ROOMprogram (transferring players or loading
items, for example). Most ROOMcommands them are wiz commands which have been
changed to allow for rooms to perform the commands. In this version of
Programs, players have been prevented from using these commands by adding
a separate interpreter for ROOMcommands. This also speeds up (in most cases)
ROOMprogram execution when ROOMcommands are used. All ROOMcommands are
preceded with the word 'ROOM' on the command line.


Syntax:  ROOM ASOUND [string]
	 ROOM ZECHO  [string]
	 ROOM GECHO  [string]

	ASOUND prints the text string to the rooms around the room in the
	same manner as a death cry.
	ZECHO prints the string to all players in the same area. 
	GECHO prints the string to all players in the game.

Syntax:  ROOM ECHO                 [string]
	 ROOM ECHOAT      [victim] [string]
	 ROOM ECHOAROUND  [victim] [string]

	ECHO displays the string to everyone in the room. ECHOAT displays
	the string to the victim only. ECHOAROUND displays the string to
	everyone except the victim.
	The three options let you tailor the message to goto victims or do
	other sneaky stuff:).
	
Syntax:  ROOM MLOAD [vnum]
	 ROOM OLOAD [vnum] [level]

        MLOAD creates a mobile and places it in the room.
	OLOAD loads the object into the room.

Syntax:  ROOM REMOVE [victim] [vnum|'all']

	Lets the room strip an object of given vnum from the victim.
	Objects removed are destroyed. If the vnum is replaced with "all",
	the whole inventory of the victim is destroyed. This command is
	probably most useful for extracting quest items from a player
	after a quest has been completed.

Syntax:  ROOM PURGE [argument]

	Destroys the argument from the room. Without an argument
	the result is the cleansing of all NPC's and items from the room.

Syntax:  ROOM TRANSFER  [victim|'all'] [location]
	 ROOM GTRANSFER [victim]       [location]
	 ROOM OTRANSFER [object]       [location]

	Sends the victim to the destination or to the room as a
	default.  if the victim is "all" then all the characters in the room
	are transfered to the destination.  Good for starting quests or things 
	like that.  There is no message given to the player that it has been 
	transfered and the player doesnt do a look at the new room unless 
	the room forces them to.
	Gtransfer works like transfer, except that the group the victim
	belongs	to is transferred with the victim. Otransfer transfers an
	object in the room.

Syntax:  ROOM FORCE  [victim|'all'] [command]
	 ROOM GFORCE [victim]       [command]
	 ROOM VFORCE [vnum]         [command]

	Forces the victim to do the designated command. The victim is not told
	that they are forced, they just do the command so usually some rpecho
	message is nice.  You can force players to remove belongings and drop
	them, etc.  The player sees the normal command messages (such as
	removing the item and giving it away in the above example)  Again, if
	the victim is "all" then everyone in the room does the command.
	Gforce works like force except that it affects the group the victim
	belongs to.
	Vforce affects all mobiles with given vnum in the game world. This
	is useful for, for example, purging certain type of NPCs from the
	game (by forcing them to purge themselves).

Syntax:  ROOM DAMAGE [victim|'all'] [min] [max] {lethal}

	Causes unconditional damage to the victim. Specifying "all" as
	victim causes damage to all characters in the room.
	Min and max parameters define the minimum and maximum amounts of
	damage caused. By default, the damage is non-lethal, but by supplying
	the optional 'lethal' parameter, the damage can kill the victim.
	This command is silent, you must echo all messages yourself in the
	program.

Syntax:  ROOM DELAY
	 ROOM CANCEL

	ROOM DELAY sets the time in PULSE_AREA after which the room's
	delay trigger is activated. If the room has a program defined
	for delay trigger, the program is executed when the timer expires.
	ROOM CANCEL resets the delay timer.


Syntax:  ROOM REMEMBER [victim]
	 ROOM FORGET

	This command enables the room to remember a player for future
	reference in a ROOMprogram. The player can subsequently be referred
	as '$q' in programs activated by the room. ROOM FORGET clears
	the target. Note that if the first time the room runs a program,
	$q is automatically set to the player who triggered the event.
	Most commonly this command is used in delayed programs, where the
	room has to remember the player who triggered the original
	event.

Syntax:  ROOM CALL [vnum] {victim} {target1} {target2}

	This command lets you call ROOMprograms from within a running one,
	i.e. to call a ROOMprogram subroutine. The first parameter is the
	vnum of the program to execute, the second is the victim's name
	(for example $n), and the third and fourth are optional object
	names. All other parameters except vnum can be replaced with
	word 'null' indicating ignored parameter.
	ROOMprograms can be called recursively, but as a safety measure,
	parser allows only 5 recursions.

102 MPSLOWDOWN OPSLOWDOWN RPSLOWDOWN~
Slowdown-------------------------------

In the original MERC 2.2 MOBprogram documentation Nata'sha and Kahn wrote:

{x    "We have no real idea how slow this makes a mud. However, you will
find that if you are judicious with your use of MOBprograms, you can either
do little damage, or even reduce the effort on your server!  This means that
mobile polling (including the rand_progs) need only be checked when players
are around. This reduces computation of random_stuff a little, but it is
still a polling method, and subject to a basic inefficiency there. However,
aside from the rand_progs, the only additional slowdowns will be when the
mobile is responding to the situation, and you would get that from a special
procedure as well (although MOBprograms are surely not as efficient as
compiled C code)"

{x    I have used Programs extensively in my own mud without adverse
effects. This version of Programs polls random triggers only when there
are players in the area, so the load is kept to minimum. I would venture
to claim that in most cases, line lag will exceed machine lag even with
ample and complex use of Programs, especially with the speed of today's
servers..
~

102 MPLOADING OPLOADING RPLOADING~
-------------------------Loading Mobiles and Objects-------------------------

{x    No doubt you want to load objects and mobiles in your Programs
with the various "mload" and "oload" commands. There are two problems
connected to this.

One is that mloaded mobiles will appear without equipment and the
other is that it is difficult to keep track of the number of created
mobiles and objects.

{x    If you want to mobiles to appear in your area as a result of the
players' action, create a "storage room". Define resets for the mobiles
as usual (equipment etc.) and place them in the storage room. When you
need to use the mobiles, just "transfer" them to the location you
want. This is better than creating mobiles on the fly, since you don't have
to worry about creating too many mobiles or equipping them, area resets
take care of all that.

{x    If you have a Program that creates new mobiles, you might want
to make the mobiles "self-destructing". This is easiest to do with a random
trigger that checks if the mobile is doing anything useful and possibly does
'purge $i'.

{x    Another possibility is to use a "purgeroom". Create a storage
room and attach a random trigger that does 'room purge'
to that room. Now, when you need to get rid of anything, just 'transfer' 
the mobile or item to purgeroom, and it will be destroyed sometime later.
 
~

102 MPINFO OPINFO RPINFO~
------------------------Miscellaneous Information----------------------------

{x    There is really no limit to the number of Programs a given 
mobile/object/room can have. However, the length of a single command block 
is limited by the value of MAX_STRING_LENGTH.  In my version it was around 4k,
so that is probably about 100 lines.  The indentation spaces shown in the
example above are NOT required, but do make it easier to read (and debug).
HOWEVER, all spaces and indentations are loaded into memory as a part of the
program, so you're using up memory unnecessarily. Memory usage can also be
reduced by using subroutines (see MOB CALL).

{x    It IS possible to accidentally make mobiles/objects/rooms which can 
trigger in loops. Infinite loops have been prevented, but in case of a
loop, the behavior is undefined.

102 MPEXAMPLE OPEXAMPLE RPEXAMPLE~
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ EXAMPLES ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These examples all use MOBprogs, OBJ and ROOM progs are done in the same
formate (excepting the trigger on each obj/room).

In #MOBILES:

M act 1000 pokes you in the ribs.-

In #MOBPROGS:

#1000
if isnpc $n
{x   chuckle
{x   poke $n
{x   break
else
{x   if level $n <= 5
{x   or isgood $n
{x      tell $n I would rather you didnt poke me.
{x   else
{x      if level $n > 15
{x      scream
{x     say Ya know $n. I hate being poked!!!
{x     if mobhere guard
{x        mob force guard kill $n
{x     endif
{x     kill $n
{x     break
{x      endif
{x      slap $n
{x      shout MOMMY!!! $N is poking me.
{x   endif
endif
-
 
Ok.. time to translate.. the trigger will only happen when the mobile
gets the message "... pokes you in the ..." If the offender (recall
the $n and $N refer to the char who did the poking...) is an NPC, then
the mobile merely chuckles and pokes back. If the offender was a PC
then good and low level characters get a warning, high level chars
get attacked, and midlevel chars get slapped and whined at.
Also, when attacking, the mobile will check if there are guards in the
room (if mobhere guard) and if one is found, it will be forced to
attack the player, too (mob force guard mob kill $n). Notice the
use of a MOBcommand "mob force".

Note that two of these mobiles could easily get into an infinite poke
war which slows down (or frequently crashes) the mud just a bit :( 
Be very careful about things like that if you can. (i.e dont respond 
to a poke with a poke, and try not to let heavily programmed robot mobiles
wander around together. More on that is given above.)
 
Also, it is clear that the 'order' command could get confused with the 'or'
control flow. However, this is only the case when 'order' is abbreviated to
its two letter form, and placed immediately following an 'if' line. Thus,
if you want to be that malicious in trying to break the MOBprogram code,
noone is going to stand in your way (However, the result of this would be
a bug message and a bail out from the ifcheck so things dont really break)

Another example:

This program could be used on a temple guardian mobile, whose job is to
prevent evil characters from entering the sanctuary. Let's assume
the exit to the temple is north (exit 0) and the temple antechamber is
room 2301

In #MOBILES
 
M exit 1001 0

In #MOBPROGS

#1001
if isgood $n
{x   say Hail!
{x   emote salutes $n.
{x   if carries $n holy
{x      mob transfer $n 2301
{x   else
{x      say If you wish to enter the temple, get a holy symbol.
{x   endif
else
{x   curse $n
{x   say Get lost, you scum!
endif
-
 
How this works: The trigger is activated when the player tries to exit
north from the room. If the player is of good alignment, the guard will
greet the player. However, the guard will not let the player to the
temple unless he or she carries a holy symbol. If the player is neutral
or evil, the guard will curse and block the way.

Example of using DELAY and REMEMBER:

In #MOBILES

M greet 1002 100
M delay 1003 100

In #MOBPROGS

#1002
if isevil $n
{x   say You infidel! Go away or face the wrath of mighty Mota!
{x   mob remember $n
{x   mob delay 10
{x   break
endif
-

#1003
if hastarget $i
{x   growl
{x   mob echo $I screams and attacks $Q.
{x   mob kill $q
else
{x   mob forget
endif
-

How this works: When the player enters a room, the mobile checks if the
player is evil. If this is the case, the mobile makes the player the
target (mob remember) and sets up a delay of 10 * PULSE_MOBILE.
When the delay expires, program #1003 is activated. The mobile checks
if the target is still in the room (hastarget), and if the player hasn't
left, the mobile attacks ($q and $Q refer to the target). If the player
has left, the mobile will forget the player (mob forget).
 
Example of MOB CALL:

In #MOBILES:

M greet 1004 100

In #MOBPROGS:

#1004
if isgood $n
{x   mob call 1005 $n null null
else
{x   mob call 1006 $n null null
endif
-

#1005
mob echo Suddenly, a bright aura surrounds $I!
mob cast 'heal' $n
-

#1006
mob echoat $n $I points $l finger at you in fury!
mob echoaround $I points $l finger at $N in fury!
mob cast 'curse' $n

   The email command is a simple email registration system (so we can
keep track of you on Legends of Krynn for anything such as notifications
of changes or important subjects we know won't get read if posted as a note.

~

0 IMPLEMENTOR~
The most powerful being in existence.
~

0 BACK BACKWARD~
Syntax: back
{x        backward
 
While in a GROUP, this command will allow you to move yourself back in
position, moving towards the back of the group.
~

0 'BATTLE TACTICS'~
There is no actual command for this skill.  All classes may learn it at
their appropriate level the skill is given to them.  This skill helps
players move about forward and backward in groups.  It is especially helpful
to have this skill when your in battle and need to move Backwards.  Without
this skill, you may still be able to move about, however you will move
considerably slower and if your in a fight and near death, those precious
few seconds can make the difference between life and death.  
~

0 TANK TANKING TANKER~
This is not a skill, nor a command.  This is a word commonly used on
many, many MUD's, in reference to the person who wants to be up in the Front
position of the group and wants to take the most damage.  Usually, the
person "tanking" is the strongest person in the group for obvious reasons. 
Generally a Knight or Warrior and even sometimes a Thief will usually be the
"TANK" for the group.  "Tankers" usually start the fights, but not always. 
Sometimes if you have a Thief in your group, it'd be wise to let him/her
start the fight by backstabing and THEN have your normal "Tank" person step
in and rescue the thief, placing the thief out of harms way and allowing
your "Tanker" to step in and begin to "Tank" the fight.  
~

1 MOUNTJACK~
Syntax: mountjack <person who is mounted>
 
This skill will allow a person to steal someone's mount. If successful,
the player will steal their mount and will automatically mount onto the
pet, where the pet will then be in their group and be under their control.
The person who's mount was stolen, will lose the pet and will be auto-
matically dismounted. This skill will only work if the victim is currently
mounted.
~

0 REFORM~
Syntax: reform
 
This command allows you to shift out of your polymorphed stasis and back
to your original self at any time.
~

0 REPLAY~
Syntax: replay
 
This command allows you to see missed TELLS, when and if you went Link
Dead and re-connected before your character was automatically booted off.
~

0 AMBUSH~
Syntax: ambush <victim>
 
Well trained Rangers, when camouflaged, can come out of their hiding and
suprise their victim's with an ambush. It is similar to the thieve's
backstab skill, inflicting great damage to their un-suspecting victim.
~

0 BEARCALL~
Syntax: bearcall
 
Rangers have the ability to call for backup, sending 1 or 2 bears rushing
to their side. To be successful, this skill may only be used in Nature
type areas. There are different types of bears that may come to your side,
all depending on the type of terrain and the Ranger's level. These bears
may also be mounted, allowing travel to be much easier and faster.
~

0 DIMENSIONAL DOOR~
Syntax: c 'dimensional door' <target>

The dimensional door is similar to the gate spell, however, it creates a
lasting one-way gate to the target creature, instead of transporting the
caster.  Dimensional gates are entered usng the 'ENTER' or 'GO' command, as
in 'go gate'.  Dimensional gates cannot be made to certain destinations, nor
used to escape from gate-proof rooms.  Casting a Dimensional gate requires a
special source of power to be used, unfortunately the secret of this
material component has been lost...  
~

102 SEDIT~
Syntax:

sedit delete         <social>
sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]
sedit name <old name> <new name>

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent
the involved characters.

SEDIT NAME <old name> <new name> - changes the name of a social to
a new name.  Useful for socials that conflict with commands/skills.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:
$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.

So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.
~

102 PRETITLE PRE-TITLE~
Syntax: pretitle <victim> <pretitle name>
        pretitle <victim> delete
 
Pre-titles are one of those "extra" added boosts to a more intense, yet still
friendly roleplaying enviroment. You may add and delete pre-titles to and
from players using the above mentioned syntax(s). Be very cautious of what
you use and give, as they are not meant to be used in any and every case.
Good examples of pre-titles, would be giving those in the Solamnic Clan, a
pre-title that sais 'Lord', without the parenthesis of course. Only Immortals
can use this command, and if it is abused, the level at which it may be used
will be raised. Using the word delete after the player's name, will
automatically erase the pre-title from the victim.
~

102 ITEM_ARMOR~
chain    leather    plate
~

102 EMPOWER~
Syntax: empower <character> <level>

EMPOWER sets a character's level to the specified value. It is the
only way to create new Immortal characters within the game. EMPOWER
may also be used to demote characters. This command shall not and never will be
abused.
~

0 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance
 
When in a GROUP, this command will allow you to change your position, going
towards the front when in the rear or middle ranks of the group.
~

0 'BOUNTY SYSTEM'~
The bounty system allows clan members to set bounties on one another and
to collect said bounties.  To place a bounty on a player, first you must
both be in a clan. If that condition is met, then you can go ahead
and find a Bounty Collector.  A Bounty Collector is a particular mobile
similar to a shopkeeper, though instead of buying and selling goods he
provides a service.  For a small fee the Collector will add a player's
name and a price on his head to the Dead Books, a list of all the
individuals who someone was willing to pay to have killed.  To protect
your privacy, the Collector will allow you to set a bounty on a player
regardless of whether they are visible, invisible, online, or offline.
For an additional surcharge, the price on a particular player's head can
be raised.  Finally, for a significant fee, a player's name can be erased
from the Dead Books, so be sure your target isn't richer than you.

If you wish to collect on a bounty rather than place one, the Collector
can help there as well.  The Collector maintains the Dead Books and will
let you refer to them as needed to obtain a list of the bountied.  A
would-be bounty hunter then must track down and kill his target.  All that
remains to do following that is to provide proof to the Collector, namely
the victim's head.  Conveniently, the victim's head will be automatically
transferred to the bounty hunter's inventory upon his killing of the
victim.  This saves the player from repeating the grisly actions that his
character must perform in order to obtain the head.  Return to the
Collector with the proof of the deed and he will provide payment.  It's
better not to ask what the Collector does with the heads.

*** WARNING: YOU CAN NOT COLLECT A BOUNTY ON SOMEONE IF YOU SUBDUE THEM ***
 
For further information, see the help file on the BOUNTY command.

101 LOSEREPLY~
Syntax: losereply <victim>
 
This command will disable a player from being able to reply to the last
person they were talking to through TELLS. This does not disable the entire
command, just basically makes their char forget who they were talking to.
It is great for when you want to go wizinvis, and don't want anyone to know
your still on. When you normally go WIZI, the last person you were talking
to could easily use the REPLY command to send you a message, which would
inadvertantly give it away that your around. Normally this would force
you to have to log off and then back on so they couldn't reply. Now, simply
use this command on the last person you talked to and you can remain wizi
without anyone knowing whether or not your logged on or off.
~

1 'BIND WOUNDS'~
Syntax: bind <victim>

This skill allows you to help a stunned, incapacitated, or mortally
wounded person of any level.  It will stop their bleeding, and leave them
peacefully sleeping, so that, with time, they can heal normally.  
~

1 'SMITH' 'FORGE'~
Syntax: forge <raw material> into < # you wish to make object's level> <object>
* Example: forge steel into 50 shortsword
* This would forge a shortsword at level 50 out of steel raw material.

The mark of the pure blacksmith, is Forging a weapon or armor out of raw
materials.  To do this, the Blacksmith must have a Furnace, Cooling Barrel,
Grinder, and Anvil in the room with him, to be able to Forge.  The number of
Raw Materials, Forging Time, Money Needed, and Item Properties, varies on
the item you are creating. For Weapons and Armor, the LEVEL you forge the item at
will set up default values for Dam and AC values. You can only forge Weapons and
Armor with levels no more than 10 levels above your own. So, if your level 80, this
means you can not create anything with a level over 90.
~

1 FORGET~
Syntax: c 'forget' <victim>

With this spell, the skilled necromancer brings disintegration and death
to the most carefully guarded aspect of one's being by filling the mind with
an eerie void that conceals memories from the victim.  The most debilitating
effect of this spell is the loss of the ability to cast spells or use
magical devices.  In addition, some have reported that the memory loss
affects the ability to speak various languages, appraise objects, play
instruments, and more.  
~

1 'WORD OF DEATH'~
Syntax: c 'word of death' victim
 
This powerful spell gives a Necromancer the chance of killing his or her
victim on the spot. Because this spell alone, cast only once can kill
a person instantly, it's complexity is overwhelming, giving the caster
only a slim chance of success. All failed attempts will result in starting
combat.
~

1 WARDING~
Syntax: c 'warding'
 
This spell forms a strong protective barrier around it's caster. The barrier
can withstand quite a bit of damage. Only those who serve in the Holy Order
may use this spell.
~

102 NONOTE~
Syntax: nonote <victim>
 
This command will disable a person's ability to write notes to 'ALL'.
They can still write notes to individuals, Imms, clans and everything else,
and they will still be able to read all the notes, however, if they type
the word 'ALL', when they want to send it to everyone, it will not allow
them to do so, unless the NONOTE penalty is removed. This command is great
for those pesky mortals who plague the NOTE board with unwanted garbage.
~

1 'CLOSING WEAVE'~
Syntax: c 'closing weave' <gate or other target name>
 
This spell allows a conjuror to close portals which he may or may not have
open. This will also close two-sided portals as well, however the spell will
not be able to close permenant portals, only those that were created by a
magic user.
~

1 GLANCE~
Syntax: glance <victim>
 
This command, not skill, allows everyone to look at a person and determine
what kind of health condition the victim they are looking at is in. This
command may better help you in determining whether or not you want to attack
them based on not just the results you get from using the CON command,
but also based on what health condition they are in as well.
~

1 'SHIFTING SHADOWS'~
Syntax: cast 'shifting shadows'

This spell brings forth the illusion of great shadows, which surround the
caster, making him or her immune to any type of negative energy.  
This spell may only be used on the caster and nobody else.
~

1 ASSASSIN~
Assassins are murderers (especially those who kill a prominent political
figure) who kill by a treacherous surprise attack and often is hired to do
the deed.  The Assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. 
Assassins also excel at infiltration and disguise.  Assassins often function
as spies, informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance.  Their
training in anatomy stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry
out missions of death with shocking and terrifying precision.  Assassins are
usually not seen by their target, until it is too late.  Although most
Assassins are considered to be evil in nature, the truth is, they can often
be hired to serve the purposes and goals of the Light as well.  They tend to
care more about their own wealth, than the motives behind Good and Evil.  
~

1 ASSASSINATE~
Syntax: assassinate <victim> <assassination type>

This powerful skill allows a well trained assassin to kill his or her
mark in one powerful move.  The chances of success are slim to none if the
target is awake, but still possible.  However, if the target is sleeping,
the chances are greatly improved.
 
(note: To see the assassination types, simply type the command, followed by
       the name of the target and leave the third argument blank. A default
       list of choices will be shown to you.)
~

102 'SCATTER'~
Syntax: scatter
 
This command will scatter every object that is lying on the ground, and send
each one to a random room throughout the MUD. This command will not
scatter objects that have a NOPURGE flag on them, as so this command will
not go scattering fountains and other needed objects. This is more for a
quest or any other type of roleplay. It is more of a play command than it
is a constructive command. Frequent usage and/or any abuse of this command
will result in it's removal, or set so only Imps may use it.
 
(note: no argument needs to be typed after the command. Items will automatically
       disappear from the room right after the command is typed.

~

1 TROPHY~
Syntax: trophy corpse
 
This skill allows a ranger to make a bag out of the skin from any corpse.
The bag isn't too special, but can hold quite a few items.
 
(This applies to both player corpses as well as mob corpses)
~

1 COLDFIRE~
Syntax: cast 'coldfire' <victim>
 
This spell delivers a small blast of fire to the victim, however, the
temperature of the fire is the exact opposite of a normal fire, where
it's freezing, instead of hot.
~

1 'GRASPING ROOTS'~
Syntax: cast 'grasping roots' <victim>
 
This spell calls on nature for hundreds of small roots, from weeds, trees,
and various other plantlife, to come up from the ground and wrap around
the victim's feet. This entangles the victim, slowing him or her down a
great deal in battle, allowing the caster to get a few more extra hits
in.
~

1 'HERBAL DISCERN' 'FIND'~
Syntax: find <name of herb or root>
 
There are many benefits to being familiar with nature, one of them being
familiarized with the properties that herbs, fruit and many other wild
foods hold. Rangers and Druids may use this skill to locate and pick
these plants. The knowledge that one must have, is to know both the name
of the plant they're searching for, and the type of terrain to look for it
on. For an example, one must know that Garlic grows in a forest. So, to find
garlic herbs, one must be in a forest first. (The syntax there would be:
find garlic). There are many different types of herbs, etc. in the world
of Krynn. To know the names of all of them, one must either be very
knowledgable in herbs, OR hope to some day, come across a book containing
the research that a skilled herbalist had written, containing the names of the
plants and their locations.
 
~

1 'WEAR CHAIN' 'WEAR LEATHER' 'WEAR PLATE'~
These skills are automatic, in that they do not require any command to be
typed to use them.  They are basically, maneuvering skills, allowing those
that have them, to move around in combat with those types of armor.  Mages
naturally, don't wear much of anything, save a robe and boots, so having
these skills is out of the question, rendering them unable to wear armor on
certain parts of their body.  For example, if a person wants to wear any
plate type armor, one must be able to move around in it (meaning, must have
the wear_plate skill).  Without these skills, it will be impossible to wear
armor on one's torso, head, feet, arms, legs and hands.  That is, impossible
to wear certain types of armor, if they don't match one of these skills.  
~

1 GUARD~
Syntax: guard <player> (to start guarding)
        guard (to stop guarding)
 
Guarding someone will protect them from taking initial hits in combat. This
skill works best when in a group and there's someone who isn't well armored.
If the person you are guarding, logs off, you will automatically stop guarding
them, and the same goes for if you log off. This skill is also good when
walking into a room with an aggressive monster, for if the person being
guarded was going to get hit first, the person doing the guarding would
step in front of them and take the hit themselves. It would be wise to
make sure that the person doing the guarding, is the strongest in a group,
not the weakest.
~

1 RANK~
There are three (3) ranks in a group, FRONT, MIDDLE and REAR. People in
the front rank, will take full damaggiven to them by their victim. People
in the middle rank, will only take half, and people in the rear, will take
no damage, however, there is a small chance that when fighting a group
of monsters that assist each other, one of them may advance on the person
in the rear, bringing them up to the middle rank and into the action. To move
around to different rank positions, simply type BACKWARD or ADVANCE.
 
(See 'help backward' and 'help advance'. Also see 'help group' for details)
~

1 'CUTTHROAT'~
Syntax: cutthroat <victim>
 
Skilled and armed with a dagger, a person with this skill can cut open the
throat of their victim, letting a lot of blood seep out, dealing a great
amount of damage. However, the victim must be sleeping AND can not be
already hurt and suspicious.
~

1 'HEADBUTT' 'HEAD' 'BUTT'~
Syntax: headbutt
 
When in battle, sometimes a weapon is just not good enough to get the job
done. So, with a strong head, one may use it to smash other people's heads,
giving them a serious headache and a bit of damage.
~

1 BATTLEMAGE~
Battlemages are generally very disciplined warriors who have come to
understand that one must neglect neither the mind nor the body when
preparing for confrontation.  Thus, battlemages are quite formiddable
warriors, and have taken to the study of magic, most prominantly in the
school of conjuration, in order to complement their fighting skills.  While
possessing well-balanced and lethal skill, these fighting conjurors possess
neither the battle prowness of a warrior nor the arcane mastery of a mage,
but are still very effective in battle with both trades, and sometimes are
more feared than just a warrior or just a conjuror are.  
~

1 'SHIELD RUSH'~
Syntax: shield <victim>
 
Equipped with a shield, a trained Barbarian can rush a victim, using their
shield as a weapon of sort. Due to being too busy in battle to go back and
get another full rush with the shield, and because the shield is then needed
to protect the Barbarian, this skill may be used only to inititate the start
of a battle. Once fighting, a Barbarian will not be able to rush them again.
~

1 BREAKNECK~
Syntax: breakneck <victim>
 
To use this skill, one must first be wielding a hammer, or a mace. Once
wielding the appropriate weapon, a person trained with this skill will
be able to hit their opponant in the neck, nearly breaking it to where
the victim's head falls off. This will render their victim unconcious.
~

1 STRANGLE~
Syntax: strangle <victim>
 
One must be wielding a whip of some sort to perform this skill. Wrapping
your whip around your victim, will strangle them till they are unconcious,
leaving them barely breathing to keep alive.
~

1 'ALTER REALITY'~
Syntax: cast 'alter reality' <victim>
 
An illusionist who casts this spell, will put their victim in an altered
state of reality, as opposed to the hard reality one normally sees.
~

1 DOPPELGANGER~
Syntax: cast 'doppelganger' <victim>
 
This spell allows Illusionists to copy the identity of their victims. This
spell gives the illusion of them being someone else. The spell only works
if the person the are copying, is in the same room as them. It will also
only last for the duration of the spell, if the victim remains logged on. The
illusion will make them look, talk and act like the other person, making others
think they are talking to someone else. To rid oneself of this illusion, one
can either wait till the spell wears off or simply unmask him or herself, by
typing 'UNMASK'. The spell will only work on other players and will not
work on MOBs. Players will not be able to hit someone, or do anything to
someone who is using this spell, as their name is not exactly what it appears
to be.
~

1 UNMASK~
Syntax: unmask
 
This command will reform a doppeled or disguised person back to their original
self.
~

1 DISGUISE~
Syntax: disguise <victim>
 
This skill works similar to Doppelganger spell used by Illusionists, though
with a slight few differences. While you can disguise yourself to look like
another player, this skill will not allow you to disguise yourself as someone
who is either of a different race, or different sex.
 
Like Doppelganger, this skill too will not allow you to disguise yourself
as MOBs.

~

1 CHARISMA CHR~
Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness,
personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness.  It
represents actual personal strength, not merely how one is perceived by
others in a social setting.  
 
Charisma is a key modifier in applications of the following:
 
Checks in spells and skills that represent an attempt to influence others.
  (Example - Charm spell)
 
Turning checks for Necromantic spells such as Create zombie
~

1 CHARGE~
Syntax: Charge <victim> <murder|theft|assault|treason|outlaw>
{x        charge <character> <check>
 
Charge will bring up charges against a person if found guilty. What this
will do is FLAG a person, either with KILLER, THIEF, ASSAULT, TREASON, or
OUTLAW flags. Multiple charges can be brought up on someone who's found
guilty of all their crimes. This command may ONLY be used by members of
the Solamnic clan (reason being that they were the only ones who "policed"
the world of Krynn). Do not get out of hand flagging people. Do not FLAG
people just because you do not like someone, or because they did something
to one of your Alt characters. If this command gets out of hand, it shall
be removed. This command gives players a chance at governing the world
themselves a little. Charges may only be brought up on someone properly
convicted. An example would be something like this:
 
Player 1 attacks player 2.
Player 1 has to flee, and fails at murdering player 2.
Player 2 runs to find a Solamnic in the area.
Player 2 gives the whole run down of what happened and even has witnesses.
The Solamnic takes in all the evidence, but must first get player 1's side
of the story.
Player 1 says he didn't attack player 2, that it was the other way around.
Player 1 doesn't have any witnesses though.
Solamnic feels that Player 1 is guilty, so he CHARGES player 1 with ASSAULT.
 
Now, yes, there will be lying and people getting flagged for crimes they
did not commit. It would be much easier for any Solamnic to not charge
anyone with any crime, unless they witnessed it themselves, or were in the
same area and heard Player 2 YELL that he was being attacked by Player 1.
Reason being, is that if someone is wrongly accused of a crime, and is
flagged for it, they just might seek out retribution on you, the Solamnic.
 
The flags should be used for crimes as follows:
 
Murder  - Given to someone only if they're successful at killing their victim.
Theft   - Given to someone who tries to steal from someone and is caught.
Assault - Someone simply ATTACKS someone, but does NOT succeed in killing them.
Treason - Can only be given to fellow Solamnic clan memebers, for doing
          something against Solamnic Rules set forth by the leaders.
          (An example of this would be a Solamnic attacking another Solamnic,
          or a Solamnic secretly helping out a sworn enemy of the Solamnic
          knighthood and is caught)
Outlaw  - Give to anyone who abandons (quits) their Clan without permission
          from the clan's leader. (If a leader of any other CLAN wishes
          to bring one of their clanmates up on this charge, they must first
          find a solamnic knight, and then prove to them that they are the
          leader of their clan first.
 
If in doubt, always ask an Immortal for advice as to what to do in any
situation you can't reach a decision on.
 
 
Using CHECK as the third argument, shows the player's RAP SHEET. For
every crime they've ever committed, how many times charged for
that crime, and how many times pardoned for each crime as well. This will
aid in making decisions when CHARGING someone with a crime. You can see
if they are habitual criminals or not.
~

1 BACKUP~
Syntax: BACKUP
 
This Clan skill will allow a player to call for 2 clan guards. This skill
is only available to members in the clans: Solamnic, Knights of Takhisis,
and Mercenary. No other clans will get this skill. Each clan has it's own
different guards that come to their side when called.  These guards will
stay with you, so long as your still playing. If you log off, they will
stop following you and the next time you log on, you'll need to call
for more backup. Being that Knights of Takhisis and Solamnic Knights
can be found in just about every city around Krynn, cities are the only
place that this command will work in. Going out of a city, you will not
have any authority to call for backup. Mercenaries get hounds, in which
they can be found in almost any city as well, but very rare outside
of a city due to poor living conditions.
 
This skill may be used in the above 3 clans mentioned, when and if
a clan member is promoted to the Rank of 4 or higher.
~

1 'DRAIN BLOOD'~
Syntax: drain corpse
 
This skill drains the blood from a corpse, pouring it into an emtpy jar.
This will in turn, destroy the corpse. The blood can be used for various
things. One can even drink the blood, which depending on the corpse
the blood was drained from, can increase one's power, or seriously poison
them, a risk worth taking.
~

1 'MOUNTED COMBAT'~
There is no syntax for this skill.  It is automatic.  This skill is not a
damage enhancer, nor a superior defense skill either.  This skill allows a
rider to use his or her skills while still mounted.  Some offensive moves
can not be performed on someone who's mounted, which is where this skill
comes in handy.  Such skills that will not affect a mounted combatant are
Trip and Blackjack.  The rest of them is for the rider to find out.  
~

1 PRESERVATION~
Syntax: c 'preservation' <object>
 
This spell allows Necromancers to preserve body parts, slowing the decaying
process. One must be carrying the object, the spell will not work if it is on
the ground. Slowing the decaying process of a body part can be useful
to those who like to carry body parts around for a while, showing them off
as trophies. Any other use of this spell is still unknown, but then again,
Necromancers are well known for their sick and evil twisted practices.
~

1 'LOOKING GLASS'~
Syntax: c 'looking glass' <vicitm>
 
By bending the light entering the victim's eyes, the caster is able to change
his opponent's view of reality.
~

1 'AURA CLEANSE'~
Syntax: c 'aura cleanse' <object>
 
This spell allows the caster to remove certain properties from an object.
In essence, this spell makes objects neutral, by removing any ANTI-(align)
flags. It will also remove any evil or dark properties set in the object as
well.
~

1 'CAUSE DISCORD'~
Syntax: c 'cause discord' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to spread chaos throughout a group of people.
The victim, once affected, will suddenly hate his or her fellow groupmates
and will turn their blade on them. This will in effect, cause the group
to disband. If cast on a PET, the PET will simply cease to fight along
side it's master.
 
~

1 BOW~
Syntax: FIRE <victim>

This melee weapon skill allows a person to fire arrows at their victim
from a distance.  To be able to fire an arrow at someone, a couple of things
must be satisfied.  First off, a person must be wearing a Quiver of arrows
and Wielding a bow.  The second thing is that a person can only fire an
arrow from the BACK of a group.  Since a single person can not move back in
rank unless they are grouped up with someone, even if a pet, this means that
a person can not fire any arrows when hunting alone.  If successful, the
arrow will hit the victim, causing damage.
~

1 DISLODGE~
Syntax: dislodge arrow
 
This will remove any arrows lodged into your body. However, dislodging
them can and will cause additional damage as the tip is pulled from
your bleeding wound.
~

1 'SEAL DOOR' 'UNSEAL DOOR'~
Syntax: c 'seal door' <direction of door>
        c 'unseal door' <direction of sealed door>
 
The seal door spell will place a magical seal on a door, making it
impossible to be opened unless the magical seal is removed.
 
The unseal door spell will removed a door that has had a magical seal
placed over it, allowing the door to be opened.
 
These spells can come in very handy when trying to avoid someone who's
coming after you from entering the room your hiding in.
~

102 FVLIST~
Syntax:
  fvlist obj
  fvlist mob
  fvlist room

This command will show you an entire list of FREE Vnums in the area that
you are in, for Mobs, Objects and Rooms. In other words, the list of
VNUMS that's displayed, are the ones you can use (for whatever argument
you typed in). If it's not on the list, then you can't create the Room,
Object, or Mob that you typed in as the argument, using that VNUM. This
should help out a lot, no longer will you have to go into REDIT and type
RLIST ALL, OLIST ALL, or MLIST ALL, to find out which VNUMS ARE already
being used, and then figure out one that you can use. Simplicity and Speed
is your friend.
~

102 MEMCHECK~
Basically, this WIZNET feature helps track down memory leaks.  This new
wiznet feature can be annoying, in that it's always going to show up, the
more players typing in commands, the more spam messages.  So you might not
want to have this on, unless that's all your doing, is locating memory
leaks.  Basically it compares the number of allocated strings and perm
blocks after a command is executed to the number prior to execution and if
there has been an increase flags this on a new wiznet channel.  Now, the
observant among you will notice that this will flag a hell of a lot of olc
commands which by their very nature allocate new memory, plus lots of common
commands which during their execution may need a block of a size currently
not around so it's allocated.  This in mind though, seeing a command that
shouldnt be alocating flagging on wiznet say, 3 times in a row, can be a
pretty darn good indication that maybe there's a leak.  A lot of commands
will be flagged, but if someone types in the same command like 2 or 3 times
in a row, and the flag comes up each time, please send a note to IMMORTAL
about this, with what happened, so we can take a look at it and maybe fix
the leak.  
~

1 HEEL~
Syntax: heel
 
This command is used to make your pet come running to you if it gets lost.
HEEL makes you let out a loud distinct whistle that your pet is familiar
with. However, beware that if your pet gets lost in a different area than
the one you are in, no matter how loud or how hard you whistle, it won't
hear you and will not come running. You'll have to go wandering around
to different areas and try whistling there.
~

1 IMPALE~
Syntax: impale <victim>
 
This skill requires the use of a spear. Not proficient in using a spear
will mean that you will not be proficient in impaling either. This skill
will thrust the tip of your spear into the guts of your enemy, inflicting
serious wounds.
~

1 ATTUNEMENT~
Syntax: c 'attunement' <victim>
 
This spell will attune the victim to the web of life, enhancing a
few select attributes.
~

1 SATE~

This spell will subside a victim's hunger, preventing anyone from dying
of hunger.
~

1 INVIGORATE~
Syntax: c 'invigorate' <victim>
 
This spell allows Clerics to heal their victim's mana loss. This spell does
not give the victim the same amount of mana the caster loses, but rather a
set given amount based on the caster's level. This spell would be good to
have when in a group, with a powerful Mage who has no mana left, but has
some good offensive spells and needs more mana to cast them.
~

1 'PASS WITHOUT TRACE'~
Syntax: c 'pass without trace'
 
This spell may be cast by Druids only, and can only be cast on the caster
him or herself. This spell will allow the Druid to walk around when seriously
injured without leaving any trails of blood for someone to follow. This spell
will also prevent Rangers and other people of the like, from being able to
track the Druid. It will also prevent angry mobs from being able to track
the Druid down if he or she flees a battle.
~

1 LUCK~
Syntax: c 'luck' <victim>
 
This spell is the exact opposite of the spell 'bad luck', in which
this spell will bring good fortune to the person, giving them better odds
of landing successful blows, and more of them, in a battle.
~

1 'BAD LUCK'~
Syntax: c 'bad luck' <victim>
 
This spell brings bad luck and misfortune to the victim, giving them worse
odds of landing successful blows, and less of them, in a battle.
~

1 'DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR'~
Syntax: c 'delusions of grandeur' <victim>
 
This spell gives the victim the illusion that they're invincible. They will

in others.
~

1 MIRROR~
Syntax: c 'mirror' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to create an illusionary mirror image of his
or her target, to include even him or herself. The amount of images that
are created depends on the level of the caster, not the level of the victim.
The victim can be of any level, but it can not be cast on a Mob.
 
The images will follow their true self, until either the person quits, or
is transported through a spell or any other means that will take the
person out of the room and to somewhere else that does not involve walking.
 
These images are harmless and can be killed by anyone of any level. Their
intent is on keeping the true identity of the person from scrying eyes
hidden.
~

1 'CLOAK OF STARLIGHT'~
Syntax: c 'cloak of starlight'
 
This powerful defensive spell is only granted to high ranking members
who have passed the "Test" and joined the ranks of the Conclave. This

sort must be held in the hands or wielded, in order for the jab to be
possible.  
~

1 CLEAVE~
Syntax: cleave <victim>

A person with this skill may choose to initiate combat with a massive
cleave.  If successful, the cleave will inflict much higher damage than a
normal hit.  However, the target must have no less than 80% of his/her HP
for the cleave to be successful.  In order to use this skill at all, one
must be proficient in the use of wielding an axe first.  
~

1 TUMBLE~
Using cunning speed and agile movements, a person trained in this skill
will have a chance of tumbling out the way from a blow intended to hit them
in battle.  The chance of tumbling out of the way is also affected by the
dexterity of the attacker and the target.  
~

1 TRAMMEL~
Syntax: trammel <victim>

This ability allows a skilled Warrior or Knight to evaluate enemy
defences and deliver a powerful flank attack.  In order to effectively
examine an opponent's weaknesses, one must be in the middle rank of his
group before he can attempt to execute a flank attack.  Due to the necessary
distance, he must also be wielding a long-shafted weapon such as a polearm,
staff, or spear.  Also, once a flank attack is executed, a warrior must
reposition himself in the middle rank of combat before he can follow through
another flank attack.  It has been noted that this fighting style is best
suited to deft Warriors or Knights who are apt to be more skilled at quick
manuevers.  
~

1 VORTEX~
Syntax: c 'vortex'
 
This spell is similar to a teleport spell, in that it sends the Druid to a
random room. The room however, will only be one that is within the immediate
area. This spell will not send anyone to a different area. The room the caster
is sent to is random and cannot be controlled. This spell is very useful
for those who are being followed or hunted down. This spell cannot however,
be used once combat is initiated. This spell can only be cast on the
caster himself, and nobody else.

When this dire enchantment is cast, the caster curses a single creature to
endure restless and sleepless nights. For the duration of the spell, the
victim cannot sleep. Furthermore, the victim is immune to all spells that

this condition. Only a Remove Curse spell can relieve the victim from their
sleepless nights.
~

1 'SECOND BACKSTAB'~
Thieves and Assassins have achieved a high level are able to backstab an
opponent a second time.  This backstab happens automatically and does not
need to be typed.  If the thief is hasted, he/she has the chance to backstab
four consecutive times.  To backstab twice however, one must be wielding two
daggers at the same time.  
~

1 'QUIET MOVEMENT'~
Similar to sneaking, this skill allows Rangers and Druids to travel about
on foot with stealth, quieting their movements as to not alarm anyone of
their presence when walking into a room.  This skill is automatic and
requires no command to be typed.  
~

1 SEQUESTER~
Syntax: c 'sequester' <object>
{x        c 'sequester' <victim>

This spell renders objects in the casters' inventory invisible.  This
spell does not however, prevent the objects from being seen through other
means of magic, such as a detection spell.  This spell may also be cast upon
creatures, putting them into suspended animation.  Only a remove paralysis
spell can remove the affects of this spell on a person.  
~

1 STRIP~

have been sent. The file will continue to grow until it is purged
of it's contents (using delete command). The delete command for prayfile
is only usable by Implementors. So, if it gets awefully long, let someone
know.
~

102 VSEARCH~
Syntax: vsearch <vnum>
 
Similar to OWHERE command, this command will search the entire world for
objects with the VNUM you type in, and will display where they are found, if
any at all. This will help cut down on having to parse through NAMES of
of all objects that match the one your looking for, when you know the VNUM and
just want to know where 1 particular object is located throughout the world.
~

1 SERENADE~
Syntax: serenade <victim>

Using undying charms and social graces, the eloquent Bard is able to
sing a lilting serenade.  Often members of the opposite gender of the

victim. Yes, the charm effect even works on PCs as well as NPCs.
A failed serenade will initiate an attack.
~

1 SURGE 'MANA SURGE'~
Syntax: surge <victim>

By focusing all of his power, the user of this skill can strike at the
mana essence of his opponent.  This strike burns away the target's magical
energies, doing minor damage.  It also causes the target to lose that mana-
essence, until they regenerate it with rest and meditation.  This skill 
may only be used while in combat. Basically, it's the user of this skill
using their victim's own Mana against them. The victim losing both mana,
and HP from the damage it causes.

1 ENDURE~
Syntax: endure

1 'RAY OF FATIGUE'~
Syntax: c 'ray of fatigue' <victim>

This spell affects the victim's life energies, increasing fatigue or
exhaustion the victim currently possesses.  Alert and well-rested creatures
suddenly become sluggish and tired, and those who are already fatigued may
be reduced to near-helplessness.  This spell will reduce a victim's movement
by a considerable amount, in addition to reducing the victim's dexterity.  
~

1 'PRESERVE DEAD'~
Syntax: c 'preserve dead' <corpse>

This spell is similar to the preservation spell, in that it draws it's
energy from the same source.  This spell however, will preserve a corpse,
prolonging the effects of decay, giving the Necromancer more time to cast
the Animate Corpse spell.  
~

1 'MOONCLOAK'~
Syntax: c 'mooncloak' <victim>

This spell is usable ONLY at night and under a cloudless, moonlit sky. 
The spell will not work if any other conditions exist, such as lightning and
rain.  This gives the caster a very limited chance of casting the spell, as
two conditions must be met.  However, the affects of the spell are well
worth it, if the caster is successful.  The incantation weaves an aura of
moonlight around the caster or a chosen visable being within spell range. 
Within it's confines, creatures receive special benefits against all
cold-based and negative-based attacks, making them virtually immune to them.
Only a Dark Taint spell can somewhat counter the affects of it's
semi-immunity to negative based attacks.  
~

1 TAUNT~
Syntax: taunt

A clever Bard is able to carefully deliver insults so witty that
those in the room are often whipped into such a rage that their combat
abilities are hindered.

Rumor has it that human Bards actually learned this ability in
Kendermore.
 
Should be noted that this skill is harder to provoke a fight with a PC than it
is with an NPC.
~

1 BRAVADO~
Syntax:  bravado

By giving an inspirational speech or chanting an ancient battle-hymn, the
skilled Bard is almost always able to increase the morale of his or
her group in even the most dire of circumstances.  Such a rousing

march into battle with renewed vigor.
~

1 LULL~
Syntax: lull <victim>

By carefully speaking or singing in a soft tone to an individual, a
soft-spoken Bard will be able to put any friend or foe into a deep
sleep.  Different factors can influence the Bard's effectiveness: things
such as whether the person is hungry, whether the person might trust the
Bard more implicitly through race or general charismatic appearance. etc
~

1 PACIFY~
Syntax: pacify <target>

By carefully lowering the voice into a calm, melodious
form of speech, the skilled bard is able to pacify
both wild creatures and aggressive brigands alike.
This skill will only come in real use to the Bard if
he or she is already hidden or invis to prevent
the aggressor from attacking immediately before the
speech can even be spoken. This can also be used to
help out others who are much weaker and need assistance
getting by the said aggressor.

foe. The God will not enhance this spell if it is used on a good
aligned person.  The more the victim leans toward evil, the more damaging
this spell will be.
~

1 'GREAT WASTING'~
Syntax: c 'great wasting' <victim>

GREAT WASTING is a spell that tampers with a person's attunement to
nature, and alters the body's regenerative capabilties. The target will
find themselves unable to recover from wounds as quickly as they'd
normally be able to, taking twice as much time to heal a wound. Also,
spell-casters affected by this will find that it takes longer for their mana-
energies to return, taking about twice as long.
~

1 'FUMBLE'~
Syntax: c 'fumble' <victim>
 
This spell acts like the Disarm skill, in that it causes the intended
victim to lose his or her weapon. It may also cause the victim to lose
their grip on held items and light sources.
~

1 'REGENERATION'~
Syntax: c 'regeneration' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to focus the energy of life forces, thus
causing the target to regenerate health faster than a normal rate for the

that can aid him or her in magic tricks as well as combat.

1 'BANISH'~
Syntax: c 'banish' <victim>
 
A member of the Holy Order may use this special spell in order to Banish
someone from their site, sending them to a random location anywhere in the
world. This spell is similar to teleport, except this spell has less
restrictions.
~

1 'SALVATION'~
Syntax: c 'salvation' <victim>
 
This spell allows those who are forutunate enough to join the ranks of the
Holy Order, the ability to be other people's salvation. It may be used
at any given time, so long as the target is in the same room as the caster.
This spell will automatically transfer their target to the Temple of Paladine
in Palanthas. This spell is most effective for rescuing people who are in
combat and in dire need of help to get away from the battle in order to
survive.
~

1 'SCRYE'~
Syntax: c 'scrye' <victim>
 
SCRYE allows the caster to bring forth the image of the target in their

that causes most people to see spots for a short duration.  It causes a

the casting of this spell, a learned Druid summons forth a strong beam of
pure sunlight from his or her hands to strike down an opponent.  A powerful
enough Druid can even blind the victim.
~

1 ETHOS~
ETHOS is an indication of your character's reaction towards laws.  It
has three values: lawful, neutral, and chaotic.  It is quite acceptable
for evil characters to be lawful and good characters to be chaotic.
These represent each character's understanding of society and
relationships.

At this time, ethos does not affect anything in the game and cannot be
changed after character creation.  It is simply a tool for roleplaying.
If your character changes and ethos would be affect, play your character
as if ethos has changed, even if the statistic does not reflect it.

~

1 LAWFUL 'LAWFUL ETHOS'~
Characters who believe in law maintain that order, organization, and
society are important, indeed vital, forces of the universe.  The
relationships between people and governments exist naturally.  Lawful
philosophers maintain that this order is not created by man, but is a
natural law of the universe.  Although man does not create orderly
structures, it is his obligation to function within them, lest the
fabric of everything crumble.  For less philosophical types,
lawfulness manifests itself in the belief that laws should be made
and followed, if only to have understandable rules for society.
People should not pursue personal vendettas, for example, but should
present their claims to the proper authorities.  Strength comes
through unity of action, as can be seen in guilds, empires, and
powerful churchs.

See also helps: ETHOS, 'LAWFUL GOOD', 'LAWFUL NEUTRAL', 'LAWFUL EVIL'
~

1 'LAWFUL GOOD'~
Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society
with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the
majority of the people.  To ensure the quality of life, laws must be
created and obeyed.  When people respect the laws and try to help one
another, society as a whole prospers.  Therefore, lawful good characters
strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most
people and cause the least harm.  An honest and hard-working serf, a
kindly and wis king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are
all examples of lawful good people.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS
~

1 'LAWFUL EVIL'~
These characters believe in using society and its laws to benefit
themselves.  Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule
as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.
To this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that
protect their own concerns.  If someone is hurt or suffers because of a
law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad.  Lawful evil characters
obey laws out of fear of punishment.  Because they may be forced to honor
an unfavorable contract or oath they have made, lawful evil characters are
usually very careful about giving their word.  Once given, they break
their word only if they can find a way to do it legally, within the laws
of the society.  An iron-fisted tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are
examples of lawful evil beings.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS 
~

1 'LAWFUL NEUTRAL'~
Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this
alignment.  They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether
that government is a tyranny or benevolent democracy.  The benefits of
organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by
their actions.  An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any
cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of
lawful neutral behavior.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS
~

1 CHAOTIC 'CHAOTIC ETHOS'~
The believers in chaos hold that there is no preordained order or
careful balance of forces in the universe.  Instead they see the
universe as a collection of things and events, some related to each
other and others completely independent.  They tend to hold that
individual actions account for the differences in things and that
events in one area do not alter the fabric of the universe halfway
across the galaxy.  Chaotic philosophers believe in the power of the
individual over his own destiny and are fond of anarchist nations.
Being more pragmatic, non-philosophers recognize the function of
society in protecting their individual rights.  Chaotics can be hard
to govern as a group, since they place their own needs and desires
above those of society.

~

1 'CHAOTIC EVIL'~
These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized.
Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain
and pleasure.  They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever
they want by whatever means possible.  Laws and governments are the
tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves.  The strong have the
right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited.
When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by
a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies.  Such a
group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying
his underlings into obedience.  Since leadership is based on raw
power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of
weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any
method.  Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low intelligence are
fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.

~

1 'CHAOTIC NEUTRAL'~
Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything,
including their own actions.  With this as a guiding principle, they
tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment.  Good and evil
are irrelevant when making a decision.  Chaotic neutral characters are
extremely difficult to deal with.  Such characters have been known to
cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have
on the roll of a single die.  They are almost totally unreliable.  In
fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied
upon!  This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play.  Lunatics
and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS
~

1 'CHAOTIC GOOD'~
Chaotic good characters are strong individualists marked by a streak
of kindness and benevolence.  They believe in all the virtues of
goodness and right, but they have little use for laws and regulations.
They have no use for people who "try to push folk around and tell them
what to do".  Their actions are guided by their own moral compass
which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the
rest of society.  A brave frontiersman forever moving on as settlers
follow in his wake is an example of a chaotic good character.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS 
~

1 'NEUTRAL ETHOS'~
Those espousing neutrality tend to take a more balanced view of things.
They hold that for every force in the universe, there is an opposite
force somewhere.  Where there is lawfulness, there is also chaos;
where there is neutrality, there is also partisanship.  The same is
true of good and evil, life and death.  What is important is that all
these forces remain in balance with each other.  If one factor becomes
ascendant over its opposite, the universe becomes unbalanced.  If
enough of these polarities go out of balance, the fabric of reality
could pull itself apart.  For example, if death became ascendant over
life, the universe would become a barren wasteland.

Philosophers of neutrality not only presuppose the existence of
opposites, but they also theorize that the universe would vanish
should one opposite completely destroy the other (since nothing can
exist without its opposite).  Fortunately for these philosophers (and
all sentient life), the universe seems to be efficient at regulating
itself.  Only when a powerful, unbalancing force appears (which almost
never happens) need the defenders of neutrality become seriously
concerned.

~

1 'NEUTRAL GOOD'~
These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that
the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good.  Since
the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different
goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may
even maintain it.  If fostering good means supporting organized society,
then that is what must be done.  If good can only come about through the
overthrow of existing social order, so be it.  Social structure itself
has no innate value to them.  A baron who violates the orders of his
king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral
good character.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS
~

1 'TRUE NEUTRAL'~
True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and
they refuse to see actions as either good or evil.  Since the majority
of people in the world make judgements, true neutral characters are
extremely rare.  True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the
forces of either good or evil, law or chaos.  It is their duty to see
that all of these forces remain in balanced contention.
True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather
peculiar alliances.  To a great extent, they are compelled to side
with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides
as the previous loser becomes the winner.  A true neutral druid might
join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop
out or switch sides when the gnolls were brought to the brink of
destruction.  He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too
powerful.  Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the
world.

~

1 'NEUTRAL EVIL'~
Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and
their own advancement.  They have no particular objection to working
with others or, for that matter, going it on their own.  Their only
interest is in getting ahead.  If there is a quick and easy way to
gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously
illegal, they take advantage of it.  Although neutral evil characters
do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters,
they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for
personal gain.  They typically base their allegiance on power and
money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes.  An unscrupulous
mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays
people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical
examples of neutral evil characters.

See also helps: ALIGNMENT, ETHOS
~

1 ALIGNMENT~
ALIGNMENT is your character's attitudes and values of life.  There are
three basic alignments: good, neutral, and evil.  Each of these alignments
has varying degrees as well.  Depending on your alignment, your may not be
able to use certain skills, wear certain items, or be welcome in certain
places.  It will also affect how other characters react towards you.  They
reflect a character's moral outlook; they are his or her internal guideposts
to what is right or wrong.  
~

1 'CPOSE'~
Syntax:  cpose <text>
         cpose clear

CPOSE allows characters to show what actions they are doing while in a
room.  Abuses of this feature will result in heavy penalties or loss of
the ability to use the cpose.

To learn how to make optimal poses try using the format:

cpose is <verb>ing <prepositional phrase>.

After the ing, a prepositional phrase is added to the end to give the pose
context within the area.

For example, Sarven is having a bad ic day and shows it by typing:

cpose is crying in a corner of the room.

This will be displayed to anyone who looks or enters the room, like this:

Sarven is crying in a corner of the room.

Try to avoid direct actions that would be more appropriate as emotes.  If
your character only briefly does the action and someone walking into the
room a few seconds later would not see your pose, then you need to use an
emote instead of a cpose.

CPOSE CLEAR allows a person to clear the pose back to the default setting. 
~

1 APPREHEND~
Syntax: apprehend <character> <assault|murder|theft|treason>
 
This command is given to all Solamnic Knights. It is a command which will
enable them to apprehend people who are CHARGED with a crime. If successful,
the victim will be sent off to jail with a sentence based on the crime they
commited. They will not be able to get out of jail until their sentence is
up. This command is mostly level based, so for someone trying to apprehend
a person who is higher level than they are, they won't be too successful.
This is an alternate method to taking care of criminals, rather than
just killing them. It gives a more realistic method of governing (policing)
the world.

take actions that uphold the mission statement.
{x
{x
2) Immortals Should Use Their 'god' Abilities Consistently with the
Immortal Commandments.
 
2.1) When roleplaying a god persona, care should be exercised when
interacting with mortals. Actions that may cause a change in a player's
character or concept should be considered a major event, and as such care
should be taken to not alter the character's concept if at all possible.
Always remember, we're making the Legends of Krynn MUD available for the

directly insulted or provoked, killing by an immortal is permissible,
but alternate forms of IC punishment are encouraged.
{x
{x
3) Player Killing is Allowed When Justified by Roleplay
{x
3.1) Players must have a logical reason to kill another player that
involves roleplay. These include but are not limited to: killing due to
opposite org/religious affiliation, killing due to IC grievances such as
stealing or assaulting, killing for limited or unique items, killing due
to Mercenary bounties, or killing due to involved roleplay between the two
characters.

approve of the appointment to that level.  Discussion with the hosts of
the mud should take place before this action is taken.  The hosts reserve
the right to reverse an appointment to implementor if they were not
consulted in that promotion and feel that the person is not ready for the
position.  Hosts also reserve the right to make additions to the staff
without consulting the rest of the Immortal and/or Implementor Staff.
This especially applies when in the absence of the current Implementors.
The current host of the Legends of Krynn is Hiddukel.
{x
{x
5) Immortal Staff Authority
{x
5.1) Immortal Staff Authority is based on level. In this way the
implementors have given certain levels of trust to different individuals
for different reasons. As such each greater level of immortals has more
responsibility and authority than lower levels.
{x
5.2) Implementors have the final say on matters. Official decisions
require a majority vote of IMPs. Major policy changes or changes which may
significantly alter the game must be discussed with all immortals.
{x
5.3) Immortals may act in whatever capacity that the commands at their
level allow them in terms of discipline measures.
{x
5.4) Any immortal may call a vote to address changes to the mud.  This is

IMPs.
{x
5.5) All immortals have a say in the day-to-day running of the mud, each

108, 109      4 votes
106, 107      3 votes
104, 105      2 votes
102, 103      1 vote
{x
5.5.2) For simple skill and rules additions or changes, the vote required
is 51% or a simple majority of all immortals participating in the vote.
{x
5.5.3) Major changes to game play require the approval vote of 75% of the
immortal staff participating in the vote.

6) Arbiters
{x
6.1) The host of the Legends of Krynn MUD, Hiddukel (Craig), is to act as
arbiters for the implementors.  When disagreements arise that are not
resolvable by discussion between implementors, the implementors can
address differences in opinion to the arbiters.  The implementors agree to
abide by the decision of the arbiters.

the glory of the Dark Gods. We devote body, mind and soul to the Dark Gods.
We believe that for order to be maintained Darkness must be in control. We
rely on dark and evil religion. We welcome all to the order only if they
worship Dark Gods. About the only thing we favor are the Dark Clerics in our
ranks. Betrayal will be handled quickly and harshly. The Black Order comes
first before any personal matter. Members are expected to share what they
know with other members. The Dark Gods favor us and we grow more powerful by
the day. If you wish to join the order an application must be sent to
BLACKORDER for review, and if accepted a member will seek you out to induct
you.

1 ARTISAN ARTISANS~
{x                            The Artisans

The Artisans are the craftsmen for the art of warfare. The ringing of a
hammer as it strikes the anvil is our Song of Life. The brilliance of a well 
crafted sword or a durable helm will almost bring a tear to your eye and a 
smile on your face. The brethren of the forge are a family as close to ones 
own natural born.

We, the ARTISANS strive to be a self contained, force to be reckoned with. 
We support our own first, and on a good day may even help those in need. We 
feel that one should be able to support oneself, those who always beg for 
handouts, gives a hard working ARTISAN a bad taste in the mouth...

A burly dwarf steps forward and looks you over from head to toe, "So ye
be a wantin' to join de brethren, eh? Well den sit right down, anna
write o' letter to de ARTISANS."

(ooc: A brief note to ARTISANS should tell us why you want to join and when
you are usually on. May ye be join our family soon...) 
~

1 'GARBLE'~
Syntax: c 'garble' <victim>

This spell twists the tongue of the victim, rendering their speech to
become unpronouncable and distorted.  In some cases this will render them
speechless, such as in casting spells.  
~

1 'MESSAGE'~
Syntax: message <text>
 
This is another command for the clan channel. It operates the same as the
CLAN command.
 
Note: For those who are in the Solamnic, KoT and Mercenary Clans,
      You are required to use your Backup command in order to get those
      mobs into the same room as you first, in order to use the clan
      channel. The mobs that are summoned using the Backup command,
      do NOT neccissarily need to be following you. As long as they
      are in the same room, your good to go.
~

1 'DETECT PRESENCE'~
Syntax: c 'detect presence'

This spell allows the caster to detect other players in the local area.
The means by which the mage accomplishes this is specific to the guild of
magic under which they study. This spell will not work in certain areas,
such as being indoors will not give the caster an accurate reading.
~

1 EAVESDROP~
This skill allows for the possibility to overhear whispers between
characters in the same room as you.  This skill is automatic.  Note that,
while you may be able to overhear a conversation, unless you understand the
language it is spoken in, you will not know what they are saying.  
~

1 EVICT~
Syntax: evict <player>
 
This command may be used only by clan members who have been elected as a
leader. This will remove them from your clan. Only Implementors can dismiss
Immortals.
 
See also: Help Admit
~

1 'DISMISS'~
Syntax: dismiss <mob>
 
This command will dismiss a mobile, sending them back to where they came
from. This command requires the mobile victim to be charmed and under your
control for most of the dismissable mobs. The list of mobiles below fall
under this requirement:
 
MAGE SUMMONED MOBS:

- rabbits
- ethereal warriors
- nightmares
- zombies
- skeletons
- unseen servants
- skeleton warriors
- bears (ranger summon using 'bear call' skill)
- squires (balanceorder clan summons, using 'squire call' skill)
 
Some mobs do not neccissarily require them to be charmed. Some require only
that the person doing the dismissing, is of the same clan that the person
who summoned the mob is of. These mobs can be dismissed at any time, even
if the person who is controlling them is still around, and one of his fellow
clan members decides to dimiss them for a laugh (note: NOT recommended). The
list of mobs below fall under these stipulations:
 
CLAN SUMMONED MOBS: (excludes the squire call skill)
 
- Wardens (Solamnic clan backup summon)
- Hounds  (Mercenary clan backup summon)
- Sentries (KOT clan backup summon)
 
NOTE: This command will not work for just any MOB. This command will only work
for those listed above, otherwise it would get way out of hand. The other
reason for that is because there's too many possible combinations for pets
and charmable mobs.
~

1 'ADMIT'~
Syntax: admit <char> <clan name> [ leader ]
 
This command will admit a person into their clan. Only Leaders and Immortals
can admit someone into their clan. Only Immortals can induct a person as a
LEADER into their own clan. Only Implementors can induct Immortals into a
clan, and only Implementors can induct people into other clans not of their
own, as both a member and a leader. In the Syntax above, adding the word
LEADER after the clan name your inducting someone into, will induct that
person into the clan as not only a member of that clan, but also as a leader.
 
See also: Help Evict
~

1 'BINDING'~
Syntax: c 'binding' <object>
 
This spell will bind an object with a magical substance that makes the object
become non-droppable, and in the case of a weapon, non-disarmable. This spell
has an equal chance of destroying the object in the process as it does at
being successful.

This spell increases an affected persons ability to fight in combat.
~

1 'ENLIGHTENMENT'~

course, the items will now be in their inventory, leaving them naked.
~

102 NOEXP~
Syntax: NOEXP <char>
 
This command will render a player void of being able to gain XP per kill.
It will not matter what they kill, they will gain 0 Experience Points.
This 'PENALTY' command should be used only on RARE occasions,
for instance, if a player consistantly abuses the rules of the MUD, or if
they get very disrespectful towards you, or other Immortals.
 
The usage of this command, should accompany a NOTE to immortals, stating
what time you used it, who you used it on, and why.
~

102 MPSTAT~
Syntax: mpstat <mobile>
 
This command will show you the Mprog that a mob is currently using. For
example, MPSTAT PROPHET shows you this:
 
Mobile #3084   [A crazed prophet]
Delay   0      [No target]
[No programs set]
 
It's kind of a useless command, because you can check out a mob's Mprog, by
simply going into MEDIT for that mob's VNUM. Type SHOW to see that Mprog
that is set. This command however, helps in that, if you do not have editing
privledges for an area, but want to know what the TRIGGER is on a particular
mob, this command will show you what it is.
~

102 MPDUMP~
Syntax: mpdump <vnum of Mprog>
 
This command kind of works in conjunction with the Mpstat command,
in that, once you have found a MOB with a working Mprog, and you know
the VNUM of the Mprog, Mpdump, will show you the entire Mprog as it is
written. So, if you type MPSTAT TRIFF, you get:
 
Mobile #10890  [Triff Handflute]
Delay   0      [No target]
[ 1] Trigger [ACT     ] Program [10890] Phrase [looks at you.]
 
Now, you know the VNUM for the Mprog, 10890. Typing Mpdump 10890 shows:
 
smile $n
say Nice to meet you but I must get back to work.
shake
say So much work, so little time.
 
As long as you know the VNUM of the Mprog you want to see, this command
will show you as if you were in MPEDIT and typed SHOW.
~

102 LASTON~
Syntax: laston <player name>
 
This command will display the last time someone was logged in. If you type
in the name of a person who is currently playing, it will give you the current
game time, because they are still playing. When a person logs off, that time
is recorded into their Pfile. LASTON recalls this time and gives it to you.
~

102 'IMMORTALFY'~
Syntax: immortalfy <player>
 
This command will set up a new Immortal with basic Immortal stats, saving
you the time it takes to do it all manually. It will give them all attributes
at 25, 20000 steel coins, HP/MANA/MOVE all at 30000, security level of 1,
and all skills and spells at 100%.
 
Make sure you STAT that person, and make sure they check to see that they
have ALL the spells and skills after you use this command, just to be on the
safe side.
~

102 'FADEIN' 'FADEOUT'~
Syntax: fadein  <text>
        fadeout <text>
 
Fadein and Fadeout commands are exactly like the Poofin/Poofout, and
Transin/Transout commands. When you go WIZI, or Un-WIZI, people have
always seen 'X fades into thin air' and 'X fades back into existance'.
Now, they will instead see whatever your FADEIN/FADEOUT text it instead.
This command does NOT require you to put your name in the text, so be
careful as to how you SET your text up, so it doesn't look retarded. ONLY
the people in the same room as you will see this text. You, yourself, will
NOT see the text, you will still see the same thing as you always do.
~

102 'IGRAB'~
Syntax: igrab <obj> <char>
 
This command works exactly like the GRAB command, however, this command
does NOT have any restrictions. You can only GRAB objects off of MOBS using
this command. You can ALSO GRAB items off of yourself (will help those of
you who wear NO_REMOVE flagged objects accidentally).
~

102 'SLOAD'~
Syntax: sload <mob>
{x        sload <obj> <level>

This command works EXACTLY like LOAD, see 'HELP LOAD' for details, with 1
exception.  This command will load everything without ANYONE in the room
ever seeing you load it.  It is a silent load.  Of course, loading anything
at all, silently or not, is still logged and Imps will always still be able
to see what you load.  
~

opponent's attack.  The pivot and block is a technique trained and used
automatically in combat.

an ear rending sound.  This spell may cause deafness to all unprotected
individuals in the room.  
~

cause his opponents to flee in fear.  It will also leave one's opponents
with a temporary rininging in their ears, instilling deafness for a short
time.  The warrior must be in combat.
~

1 RIPOSTE~
This skill is automatic once practiced.  It is similar to parry, however
the highly-skilled fighter actually turns his opponent's attack back at him,
possibly inflicting damage on the opponent.  
~

1 DEAFNESS~
Syntax: c 'deafness' <victim>
 
This spell renders the victim without the ability to hear. This means he/she

in their ears.
~

1 'COLDLIGHT'~
Syntax: c 'coldlight'
 
This spell is similar to the continual light spell, in that it will summon
a magical light which will last for a long time. This light however, is a
little less bright, and is very cold to the touch. It is rumored that
sometimes, it's possible for a person who touches one of these lights
to become frozen as ice, if they were NOT the one who cast the spell.
No proof has been documented to support this however.
~

~

102 'ROLEPLAY POLICY'~
Immortal Roleplay Policy

  As an RP Immortal it is your job to make sure that RP is going on 
  with the mortals. And see to it that GOOD RP is rewarded within 
  reason. If Roleplay is non-existant, start some! It's not hard,
  it's your job, to make players happy so they keep comming back.

  Also, help newbies in any way possible, even if it means creating
  a new mortal char just for grouping with them for a while.
  We need new players to stay long enough to see what this
  MUD has to offer, and we need to be involved with them, not just
  sitting idle (like some Immortals do on other MUDs).

  Also try to keep at least 1 or 2 of your mortal chars logged
  at all times. Newbies log on and then delete, all because the
  WHO list is empty. So lets try to keep the who list full ok.

  This should not have to be said, do NOT tank for mortals with your
  Immortal char or get equipment or items for them. That is one thing
  that you should NOT be doing to help them out as an RP Imm. You all
  knew that though!
 
  Lets Show Them Just How Good Legends of Krynn is!

where he wishes to have the trap set.  The first person to enter the area
after the trap has been set will suffer the effects of the trap unless they
manage to disarm it with a 'disarm traps' skill.  Traps will have a variety
of effects depending on the kind of trap.  Setting traps does not enable a
ranger to set boobytraps, nor does it make the Ranger immune to his/her own
trap, so make sure not to walk in on your own trap without the 'disarm
traps' skill.  
~

1 BOOBYTRAP~
Syntax: Drop <boobytrap>

Using this skill, a thief may boobytrap the rooms or narrow streets found

after the trap has been set will suffer the effects of the boobytrap unless
they manage to disarm it with the 'disarm traps' skill.  Traps will have a
variety of effects, depending on the kind of trap.  The knowledge a thief
aquires regarding boobytraps does not enable the thief to set wilderness
traps, nor does it prevent the thief from being immune to his/her own traps
they set, so be careful not to set your own trap off.  
~

1 ALARM~
Syntax: c alarm

This spell conjures forth a tiny bell that alerts the area to intruders
by shouting out that there are intruders and in which room the intruder(s)
have entered.  The bell remains in the area until the magic disipates.

allows them to detect and disarm traps of any type.  Trap detection and

effects usually encountered with that type of trap.  
~

1 RALLY~

into his purifying magical fire, causing it to lose all magical properties. 
The magical fire must be in the same room as the Blacksmith, and don't
worry, as ANY weapon or armor can be placed into the purifying flame, and it
will not burn.  
~

1 'MASTERWORK'~
Syntax: masterwork <object>

A master smith, can forge an item to near perfection, using their
Masterwork skill.  A second master smith, however, ALSO with the masterwork
skill, needs to be present in the room, so they can help in this daunting
task.  The amount of money needed, varies on the item being perfected, and
is deducted from the Master Smith initiating the Masterwork, which means,
that cash must be given to the smith who initiated the Masterwork.  If both
Smiths are adept in making a masterwork piece of gear, then the item will
come out without any problems, however, if only ONE of the smiths is adept,
then the outcome may not be so perfect.  This skill reinforces Weapons and
Armor with better attributes, as it is perfecting it.  
~

1 'THORS HAMMER'~

~

1 'BLACKSMITH'~
Ah, a blacksmith.  This is a NON-FIGHTING class, so don't come whining to
us about not being able to fight, or do any sort of DAMAGE anytime soon. 
With that said, Blacksmiths do NOT get ANY experience points for killing a
mob/fighting/or grouping with others.  However, Blacksmiths gain Experience
points by several means, some of which you'll pick up kind of quickly,
especially when you mysteriously go up your first level...  Now, with that
said, a Blacksmith requires several tools to make it in this world, namely a
Blacksmith's Hammer, and an Anvil.  Additional materials can be purchased at
a store.  Every skill, however, has a price tag attached to it.  For
example, a damaged weapon, might cost only 3 steel (near perfect condition)
for you to repair.  YOU, however, must market your SKILLS, to make any sort
of PROFIT.  In this example, if you charge the owner of the damaged weapon,
8 steel to repair it, you make a PROFIT of 5 steel.  Survival in this world
will be especially TOUGH for a blacksmith, and if you are NEW to this MUD, a
POWERGAMER/POWERKILLER who has gotten corrupted by the other Powerkilling
muds out there, then THIS IS NOT THE CLASS FOR YOU.  Survival depends on how
well you ROLEPLAY.  YES.  ROLEPLAY.  As this is not a Fighting class, you
must Roleplay well to obtain the business of the other players.  I can't
stress this enough.  ROLEPLAY, ROLEPLAY, ROLEPLAY.  Also remember that GOOD
RP is rewarded by Immortals to you players, so RP all the time, and you'll
be set.

~

1 'FORGEDEATH'~

103 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.
Below level 107 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'. 
~

1 'UNHOLYRITE'~
Syntax: unholyrite

 This skill allows one who works with death to gain one's health through
a sacrifice to the God of Death, Chemosh.  The sacrifice requires a
substantial amount of mental power along with a jar of blood.  The sacrifice
will not be accepted by Chemosh if one is already at full strength.  
~

102 'CHECK'~
Syntax:
'check'         display info about players
'check stats'   display info and resume stats
'check eq'      resume eq of all players
'check process' check processes of the MUD
'check snoop'   check to see who's snooping who
 
Use the stat command in case of doubt about someone...
~

102 'SGIVE'~
Syntax: sgive <item> <player> This command, will give an object in your
inventory, to any player in the MUD.  It will not notify them, or anyone
else in the room that they recieved the item.  It will, however, tell you
that the item was given successfully.  This should prove quite useful for us
Immortals who wish to stay more invisible to the mortals, and wish to give
something to them without them seeing it.  This command does NOT check for
item/weight restrictions on the player who you are giving the object to, so
do not just fill up a player with a bunch of crap items.  
~

0 'PRAY'~
Syntax: 'pray <text>'

This will send a prayer to all the Immortals that are on in the game.
Every Immortal can hear your prayers, and all your prayers are SAVED, so
even if there is no Immortal on, send a Prayer, and you will most likely get
help, as every Immortal can Read the Saved Prayers.  This channel, can be
either OOC or IC, depending.  If you need help/want to use a coupon/there is
a problem/a BUG/or something of the like, please, send your PRAY as clearly
as possible, using OOC, and being as detailed and clear about the problem as
possible.  This will aid us in fixing the problem/helping you more
effiencetly.  Now, if you are simply PRAYing for Guidance, ie, Paladine,
lend me the patience to get through these times...  Then go ahead, that is
IC.  Hopefully this makes things clear for you...  
~

0 'HOLY ORDER'~
Holy Order of the Stars
 
After the 'return' of the gods during the War of the Lance various oganizations
of people devoted to the old gods began to spring up across Ansalon.  One such
organization is the Holy Order, a group of clerics and warriors of all types
devoted to the gods of goodness.

This groups main function is to protect and heal all those in need.  Another
function of the Holy Order is bringing the word of the gods of goodness to all
those who do not follow them and bringing their wrath to those who would
threaten and bully people weaker than themselves.

The Holy Order is open to all persons (even kender) who are willing to help
protect and heal, with the execption of those classes who make a living by
stealing and murdering other without good intent.  All those who wish to join
the Order should send a message to the Holy Order or visit the Temple of the
Holy Order located in Solanthus.  Also check your hometown, for there might be
a group stationed there.
~

1 'TETHER' 'UNTETHER'~
Syntax: tether <victim>
Syntax: untether <victim>

Tether will allow you to tie your pet/mount up, so it won't follow you. 
While tethered, your pet will not follow you when you leave the room, and it
will also not follow you through any gate-like spell, recall, or come to you
if you use HEEL.  To retrieve your pet, you must travel back to the location
to which you tethered it, and Untether it, which will allow your pet to
follow you like normal again.  
~

1 'MERCENARY CLAN'~
{X                        Mercenaries of Ansalon

From all across Ansalon they come. In all shapes and sizes as well.
Warriors, strong and fierce, mages, trained in the art of battle magic.
Some come for the chance to earn cold, hard steel, others seeking
glory, fame and honour while still others, for the love of the kill.
All who can hold their own are welcome to the Mercenary lifestyle.

They are an army without a nation, fighting against whoever they
are paid to, for the most part, taking the side of whoever will pay
for the help, often playing both sides of a conflict. Mercenaries
are mainly called upon to help fight a war, or defend a small village
or country against an advancing army of goblinoids or giant-kin.
It is rare that mercenaries will be deployed to go after a single
target, unless the target is an elusive monster, or a dragon.

To aquire information on joining the Mercenies either write a send
a letter to the main office (OOC: write a note to 'mercenary'),
contact your local recruiter, or visit the Mercenary Headquarters
in Solanthus.
~

1 KNOCK~
Syntax: c 'knock' <direction>
 
This spell allows the caster to unlock doors or objects which are locked and
would normally require a key to open (and the caster does not happen to have
the key). It works similar to PICK LOCK skill for thieves.
~

1 'ILLUSIONIST'~
Illusionists are mages who have specialized their study in the related
schools of illusion.  As masters of illusion, phantasm, and illusory
alteration, these mages are known to shatter the laws which bind the
physical world to reality.  Like their magic, illusionists are not at all
what they appear to be.  Seeming to be the weakest of all mages, a skilled
illusionist can use his magic to create phantasms so believable, that many a
man has come to question the very faith of his soul in the presence of one
who wields great illusions.  Illusionists are the most subtle of all mages,
and only the most cunning and creative of minds will suceed in this field of
arcane study.  
~

1 'TRUEFIRE'~
Syntax: c 'truefire'
 
This spell creates a magical fire which, when held, gives
a person protection from evil and bonuses to their hit and
damage rolls. The bonuses vary with level.
~

102 PREFIX~
Syntax: prefix <command>
 
This nifty command comes in handy when you need to use a Command more than
once in a row, and you don't want to keep typing the command out. How this
works is:
 
If you want to use the TELL command, and even more specifically, you want to
send a TELL to a guy named GEORGE, but you don't want to have to keep
typing TELL GEORGE before what you want to say.
~

1 'PHANTOM ARMOR'~
Syntax: c 'phantom armor'

When this spell is cast, the wizard creates a quasi-real suit of plate
mail.  This semi-illusory material covers the subject and actually gives
some real protection.  This spell will not function with most other magical
protections, like Sanctuary, Armor, and Shield.  This also applies to those
other spells, as they will not work when affected by this spell.  The
protection provided is quite substantial.  
~

102 'PPRESTART'~
Syntax: pprestart
 
This command restarts up the Player Port <ONLY> when the PP is down. The
PROCESS MUST be already dead in order for this to work. If not, you won't
be able to boot up CSH for it. This command may ONLY be used on the BP, or
Builder Port. This is helpful when someone can not access the SHELL from
wherever they are logging on from. This command utilizes the core SHELL,
so do not overdo it.
~

102 'PLIST'~
Syntax: Plist <all>
        Plist <immortal>
 
This command displays a complete list of either ALL the players, including
Immortals, OR just Immortals. Along with this list, next to each name is
the number of days since that person last logged on <pfile has been modified>
 
The days are set in color. Anything that's 10 days or less, is in {gGreen{x.
From 11 to 20 days, the color is in {yYellow{x. And, anyone with days which
exceed 20, are marked in {rRed{x.
 
This command can function also as a good way to read through Pfiles, checking
on names of players. This can be used for seeing which ones
need to be deleted/denied,etc.
 
~

102 'DISABLE'~
Syntax: Disable
{x        Disable <command name>
 
This command disables commands. It will NOT disable SPELLS, of course, you
could disable the entire CAST command, which would end up disabling every
spell in the game: DON'T DO IT. This helps when there's a command which is
BUGGY, or thought to be BUGGED. This will prevent anyone, including all Imms
from being able to use it. Don't abuse this, and if a command is disabled
by someone else other than you, do NOT enable the command unless you know
for sure it's been fixed.
 
To re-enable a command that's on this list, simply type DISABLE <command>.
Disabling a command which has already been disabled, will in fact, enable the
command. So be careful not to accidentally disable something and forget to
re-disable it again so it's back on the disable list. Typing in this command
without any argument, will show you a list of commands currently on the
DISABLE LIST. Next to each disabled command, will be the LEVEL at which
the command was disabled and the name of the person who disabled it. The
LEVEL, means that anyone who's NOT of the same level or HIGHER, can not
enable the command. So if it's level 110, that means only the Imps can
enable the command.
~

102 'ILLEGALNAME'~
Syntax: Illegalname <name>
 
This command adds a player name to a list which means that it will no longer
be able to be used for character creation. Any name on this list can not
be used to create a character. This way, we don't have to HARD CODE every
name we find unsuitable for usage. Don't worry, this command is dummified,
so that you can not add the same name twice. If a name is accidentally
added to this list that needs to be removed, please see an administrator
for help.
~

102 'CLEAN'~
Syntax: clean old
        clean deny
        clean size
        clean all
 
This command cleans Pfiles. It WILL create game lag, so be careful as to
when you use this command. It's prefered that you wait till a time when there
aren't so many players on.
 
CLEAN ALL is about the only one that's really need to be used. It reads
through every Pfile and deletes all those that either have DENY flags (set
when a player is denied), and/or Pfiles which have been inactive for around
3 to 4 months. This command will also show you a list of names of Pfiles
that are extremely large. The players of those Pfiles should be notified
to drop some of their Inventory, because they're carrying too much. Large
Pfiles create game lag, and also can corrupt Pfiles, due to saving problems.
Looking at the other arguments, it's pretty easy to figure out
what each one does. CLEAN DENY only purges pfiles with a DENY flag set.
CLEAN OLD, only purges Pfiles that have been inactive for 3 to 4 months. And
CLEAN SIZE only shows Pfiles which are eating up large amounts of memory.
~

102 'VIOLATE'~
Syntax: violate <VNUM/player name>
 
This command functions like GOTO. Only this command overrides the PRIVATE
flags that may be set on a room. If a room isn't private, and GOTO could
be used, this command will not work and will refer you to use the GOTO
command instead.
~

102 'APURGE'~
Syntax: Apurge
        Apurge <player>
 
This command will completely purge a player of ALL AFFECTS that
they may have. With NO Argument added, it will purge you, yourself.
There are 0 restrictions or any exceptions. It completely removes
ALL AFFECTS from that person. Be careful when using this though. Do
NOT abuse it. Purging someone who has tons of beneficial affects,
may wind up pissing them off, possibley making them want to quit, or
worse.
~

102 'FLAG'~
Syntax: flag mob  <name> <field> <flags>
{x        flag char <name> <field> <flags>
{x        mob  flags: act,aff,off,imm,res,vuln,form,part
{x        char flags: aff2,plr,comm,aff,imm,res,vuln,aff3
{x        +: add flag, -: remove flag, = set equal to
{x        otherwise flag toggles the flags listed.
 
If all that up there confuses you, do NOT even bother to use this command at
all. This command changes FLAGS set on players and NPCs alike. The list of
flag fields is listed above. For each field, it's up to you to know or figure
out which flag needs to be changed in that field. For example, using:
 
FLAG HIDDUKEL COMM NOPRAY
 
That command would change his Pfile so that in the COMM portion, the NOPRAY
flag would be set, which means he would be able to use the PRAY command. Now,
typing in that exact same command, toggles the flag, removing the NOPRAY
flag from his COMM field, which means he'd be able to use the PRAY command
once again. This command may be very confusing for most, so don't use it
if you don't know what your doing. You could end up screwing up someone's
Pfile, or an NPC.
~

1 'EYERUB'~
Syntax: eyerub
 
This skill allows a person to rub their eyes and have a 75% chance of
successfully rubbing out either SMOKE or DIRT from their eyes, allowing
them to once again, see, without having to wait for the affects to wear off
naturally. Be warned, if failure results, rubbing one's eyes will only make
matters worse, worsening the affects of blindness from Flaming Smoke and
Dirt.
~

1 'SPOOK'~
Syntax: c 'spook' <target>
 
This spell works very similar to the Fear spell Necromancers have, only
this spell allows an Illusionist to create a very frightening illusion, which
scares the living bejesus out of their victim, causing them to flee.
~

1 'FINGERBREAK' 'FINGER BREAK'~
Syntax: fingerbreak
 
This skill allows fighters to smash their victim's fingers, which reduces
their victim's ability to hit them as often with a wielded weapon. This
will also render a Mage from being able to cast any spells, since a mage
relys heavily on channeling their magic through their hands and fingers.
Broken fingers prevent magic from being properly channeled, hence it makes
a mage powerless with their magic. There's a catch to this, and that is that
both, the fighter and the victim must both be fighting each other, and both
must be in the front rank of their groups.
~

1 'EXECUTE'~
Syntax: Execute <victim>
 
This skill allows a warrior skilled with an axe, to execute someone, lobbing
off their head. The victim must be unconcious in order for this to work, and
the executioner must not be in any type of combat. This skill only works 30%
of the time. The executioner must also be wielding an Axe in order for this
to work. No axe, no execution.
~

1 'EARPUNCH'~
Syntax: earpunch
 
This skill allows a fighter to, using their bare hands, punch their victims
in the ears with a clapping motion. This will deafen their victims and put
them into dizzy state of mind. Both, the fighter and the victim must be in
the front ranks of their group, and the fighter can not execute this while
wielding a weapon. There is a 25 percent chance that a magic user will fail
in casting spells when in this state.
~

1 'BRAINJAR'~
Syntax: brainjar <victim>
 
Striking a very hard blow to the head, this skill renders a victim incoherent.
They will be so dizzy, walking will be quite difficult, and even their speech
is affected. Victims will fall down trying to walk around as well, just as if
they were drunk. This skill can not be performed while in battle, and both
the Barbarian and the victim must be in the front rows of their ranks. If
the attempted blow to the head fails, an attack is initiated. However,
if it is a success, no attack is initiated at all, and the victim walks
around incoherently.
~

1 'DEVOTE' 'DEVOTION'~
Syntax: devote <God/Goddess>

If you have decided to follow a certain God or Goddess, you may go to
his/her temple and devote yourself to them.  By devoting yourself to your
God or Goddess, you are showing that you are truly committed to following
that diety's tenets.  This does by any means, bind you to that God or
Goddess for eternity.  It is quite possible to devote yourself to a
different God or Goddess, if you should change your mind (Roleplay ONLY). 
Once you have devoted yourself, you are marked with a small token of
devotion.  This token merely represents that you have devoted yourself to a
certain God or Goddess.  If certain devotional tasks or quests are fulfilled
(through RP ONLY, and depending upon the god), it is possible to receive the
True Mark of that God or Goddess.  True Marks are an actual representation
to whom you devote your entire life to, and to whom you shall be forever
devoted to, no matter what happens.  To be stripped of this mark, is to cast
shame and bad luck down upon you.  Being stripped of your True Mark will
also prevent future marking from being easy.  
 
The helpfile for each god lists a reference at the bottom, which one
may use to receive more information on their religion.
~

1 'RUPTURE ORGAN'~
Syntax: rupture organ
 
This skill allows a Barbarian who's proficient in Hand to Hand combat to get
in a deadly blow to their victim's organs. There is only a slight chance (10%)
that the blow will actually rupture enough organs to kill the victim on the
spot. Any other blow usually results in slightly ruptured organs, which
result in internal bleeding for the poor victim. Internal bleeding
will slowly injure a person, inflicting damage over time, at least until
the bleeding stops. This skill will not work while wielding
a weapon. The Barbarian must also be at least 95% proficient in Hand to Hand
combat. Proficiency in THIS skill, will not determine whether the blow is
fatal or not, but if the blow is not fatal, then skill proficiency will
determine whether or not the victim is even hit hard enough to do any
damage at all.
~

1 'KNOWLEDGE' 'KNOWLEDGE RELIGION'~
The followers of Knowledge value information and learning above all else.
Those who choose to follow this path dedicate their lives not only to
learning all they can in every aspect of their lives, but to sharing that
knowledge with others who seek enlightenment.  However, Gilean also upholds
the right of mortals to choose their own destinies - he does not condone
those who attempt to "force" their knowledge upon others, instead
considering such an act to be an abuse of the Balance.
 
Followers of Gilean are encouraged to serve as teachers, historians
and mediators. They owe allegiance to neither Good nor Evil;
believing that Knowledge in its pure form knows no such distinctions.
As such, they are forbidden to use their knowledge to sway others
to either side. Gilean's followers realize that truth is often
elusive and beliefs may change; therefore they do not seek to judge,
instead preferring to serve as impartial observers and objective
mediators.
 
Persons wishing to devote themselves to Gilean may be of any
ethos, but MUST be of Neutral alignment; those who stray too far from this
path may soon find themselves stripped of their religion if Gilean feels
that their objectivity has been compromised. Class and/or race
restrictions are the same as those listed in HELP BALANCE ORDER.
 
For further detail about expectations and duties, please see
HELP KNOWLEDGE2
~

1 'KNOWLEDGE2' 'KNOWLEDGE2 RELIGION'~
Those who have devoted themselves to the God of Knowledge will find that
they have embarked on a lifelong quest, for Knowledge is a pursuit without
end.  All devotees are actively required to seek out further knowledge and
share (if asked) or offer (if not) whatever they have learned with others;
be it specialized knowledge regarding one's chosen profession, or something
as simple as directions to the nearest tavern...
 
Those wishing to earn a Mark of Gilean's favor must undertake
a quest to accumulate some specified bit of wisdom and/or scour
the land for "lost knowledge" to be determined by the god and/or
his chosen High Priest(ess).
 
Whether wandering the land in pursuit of their studies, or
choosing instead to remain in one place recording important
events and serving the community, there are certain things that
ALL followers are expected to adhere to, regardless of status
or profession:
 
REQUIREMENTS: In addition to those listed above, all MARK'ed
followers are required to spend 5hrs per RL week in service as
historians (writing stories here or on the web-board about their
observations and encounters), or teachers (spending time at the
Palanthas Library answering questions from less-experienced
players, and actively helping Newbies).
 
RESTRICTIONS: ALL followers must adhere to the following rules.
Failure to abide by them will result in punishment in
proportion to status. (I.e. Devotee, MARK'ed follower, or Priest)
 
{x   ** NEVER seek to actively interfere in the events of
{x      the world UNLESS such events threaten the Balance.
{x      If you must interfere, respect the right of all to
{x      choose their own destinies.
{x
{x   ** All Knowledge is considered sacred. Do not EVER destroy
{x      a book or scroll - no matter what it contains.
{x
{x   ** Emotion clouds learning. Do not judge, and do not use
{x      knowledge to influence others.
{x
{x   ** Knowledge is invaluable. Share it for its own sake; never
{x      use it as a bargaining tool, or seek to use it for profit. 
~

1 'TONGUECUT'~
Syntax: tonguecut <victim>

This skill allows a person, using a DAGGER ONLY, to slice off their
victim's tongue.  The victim MUST BE sleeping or unconcious to cut off their
tongue.  With a lopped off tongue it is only obvious the victim will no
longer be able to cast any spells, until the Gods restore them with a new
tongue. This skill is NOT an attack skill, although failing will result in
starting a fight with the victim.
~

1 ENERVATION~
Syntax: c 'enervation' <victim>
 
This spell delivers a black bolt of negative energy to it's victim.
This negative bolt will deliver severe damage to those especially
vulnerable to negative energies.
~

1 'BEAUTY' 'BEAUTY RELIGION'~
The followers of Branchala embrace Beauty in all of it's various forms;
be it music, poetry, art or a simple sunset.  Especially valued by Elves and
Kender, this faith celebrates the inner beauty of the soul through melody
and merriment, seeking to bring all of Krynn's population together to
experience the harmony of living.
 
Followers are encouraged to spread music and art throughout the land,
introduce people to the beauty of the written and spoken word, and
bring pleasure to those around them through the appreciation of
beauty in all it's forms; using music and stories both to entertain and
to teach. Bards in particular tend to be among the most notable of
Branchala's worshippers.
 
Followers of Branchala tend to be of Neutral or Good alignment, and
Neutral or Chaotic ethos; being of the opinion that Lawful strictures
are often too constricting to allow true appreciation of all that life
has to offer, and that those rooted in Evil are often the destroyers
of the Beauty that Branchala holds dear.
 
Devotees of Beauty are often called upon to assist in celebrations,
weddings and public performances. Those wishing to be MARK'ed by
Beauty must compose a story, song or poem illustrating the inherent
beauty in life and the natural world. Once Marked by the god, followers
are responsible for mentoring younger devotees, helping to lift the
hearts of those around them through Branchala's message of beauty and
harmony, and using their talents to help those in need.
 
Above all, followers of Branchala adhere to the following guidelines:
 
{x  ** Art is done for it's own sake - Always give your best performance,
{x     no matter the audience.
{x
{x  ** Respect Nature and its beauty - it is the source of life.
{x
{x  ** Always end the day with a good story.
~

1 'WHITEMAGIC' 'WHITE MAGIC' 'WHITEMAGIC RELIGION' 'WHITE MAGIC RELIGION'~
The followers of Solinari work to promote goodness in the world through
the use of White Magic, believing that a world in which good deeds and
thoughts predominate will benefit all races and end suffering. They
believe that magic is a gift to be shared with the world and used for
the benefit of all.
 
Users of White Magic are encouraged to bring other worthy candidates to
the study of the Art, and seek out lost libraries and magical items with
which to expand the use of magic in the world. While followers of Solinari
are opposed to the goals pursued by worshippers of Nuitari, they will
cooperate to ensure the continued safety and existance of the Art.
 
In keeping with the teaching and aims of Solinari, all who would study
White Magic may be of Lawful or Neutral ethos, but MUST be of Good
alignment. Should a White-robed mage stray from these beliefs, he or she
will soon find that they lose the god's blessings. Humans and Elves are
by far the most prolific of Solinari's followers, but by no means exclusive.
 
RESTRICTIONS: Certain Races may be deemed unacceptable to receive the
blessings of Solinari. These generally include:
 
{x  ** Theiwar and Daergar: While dwarven wizards are not unheard of, these
{x     clans in particular are known for their tendancy toward dark magic.
{x  ** Draconians: The very existance of these creatures and the manner of
{x     their creation is an affront to the strictures and ideals of White Magic.
{x  ** Gnomes: Most gnomes exhibit a strong distaste for magic, preferring
{x     to rely on science and technology. While they may be capable of using
{x     magic, few realize they have the potential. Indeed, calling a gnome
{x     a wizard is considered a deadly insult by most.
{x  ** Kender: While Kender are often very interested in the effects of
{x     magic, due to their inherent nature they are unable to maintain the
{x     necessary focus needed to master the magical arts.
 
Other races wishing to receive the blessings of Solinari may do so at
the god's discretion. While recorded instances of sea elves, minotaurs
and others do exist, they are generally so few as to be considered
aberrations.
 
Those followers wishing to receive a MARK of Solinari's favor must often
undertake a quest of some sort involving the search for rare magical
artifacts, the use of magic for some great benefit to others, or the
gathering of "stray" mages into the fold.
 
All mages MARKed by their god are asked to include themselves in the
Conclave of Wizards as a sign of solidarity and dedication to the Art.
Once accepted, White mages are often the first choice for dealing with
Renegade wizards. Followers of White Magic will attempt to bring their
brethren before the Council with a minimum of force, using violence
ONLY as a last resort.
 
The defining guidelines for followers of White Magic are as follows:
 
{x  ** Devote yourself to Magic.
{x
{x  ** Use your magic for the benefit of all.
{x
{x  ** Guard magic against those who would destroy it.
~

1 'CULTURAL ARTISTRY' 'RETOOL' 'CRAFT'~
Syntax:   retool <weapon>
          craft <armor>

This skill allows a master smith to utilize forging techniques and skills
developed by their race using the ingenuity of their particular culture. As this
represents individual know-how by a particular smith, this skill may ONLY be
applied to items created in a forge. Some races are able to enhance items by
applying "finishing touches" to their work, while others talents may apply to
the forging process itself.
~

1 INSTRUCT~
Syntax: instruct <character> <skill>
 
This skill allows people who have learned their skills as high as they can
go, to teach others those skills. The skill you wish to instruct MUST be
at 100% and the person your instructing, MUST be of the same profession 
as you (same class) and MUST be able to use the skill already. This will ONLY
give a slight 2% increase in the victims skill, but you will gain a small
amount of experience from the whole thing and it will cost the victim 0
practices or trains. However, you can only instruct once per 25 ticks. No
spam instructing.
~

1 SMOTHER~
Syntax: smother <victim>
 
This skill allows you to smother the flames out on people who are set ablaze.
This will in turn, extinguish the flaming affects of a series fire spell.
~

1 FIRETONGUE~
Syntax: c 'firetongue' <victim>
 
This spell is available only to spellfilchers, allowing them to cast a seering
flame spell that sets it's victim ablaze. The only way to put out this magical
fire is by smothering them. If it is not put out, the victim will suffer burns
until it goes out on it's own.
~

1 STALK~
Syntax: stalk <victim>
 
This skill allows assassins to quickly locate someone, picking up their trail,
and while stepping into the shadows and following their trail, quickly make
their way to their victim. This, although is kind of like a GATE skill for
assassins, it still requires a lot of movement points in order to execute
this skill (1,000). Hence, it can not be spam used, so use it with caution.
~

0 BAAZ~
Baaz are the smallest draconians, standing between 5 and 6 feet in
height.  They have short, stubby tails, pairs of thin wings, lizard snouts
with small fangs, and scaly bodies.  Females look identical to males except
for a lighter build.  Newly hatched Baaz have bright, brassy scales, which
dull and become almost green as they reach maturity.  Baaz eyes are blood
red.  
 
Baaz enjoy costumes, disguises, and highly decorative clothing. They conceal
their wings under long dark robes and hide their features with large hoods
and masks. Such outfits enable them to pass through civilized lands unnoticed.
 
Baaz occupy the bottom rung on the ladder of draconian social order. They tend
to be chaotic in nature and self-serving when they can get away with it. Baaz
males serve as soldiers and laborers, while female Baaz are highly prized as
managers and low-ranking military commanders.
 
TYPICAL CLASSES: Warrior, Knight, Ranger, Blacksmith
~

0 KAPAK~
Kapak draconians stand around 6 feet tall and have sleek torsos and long
limbs.  Their scales are dull copper tinged with green, their eyes an orange
or dark brown color.  They have short manes of dark brown or blonde hair
hanging from either side of the mouth.  Soft pads line the bottom of their
feet, enabling them to move silently.  Kapaks dress in light armor for
maximum freedom of movement and to best take advantage of their natural
stealth.  
 
The Kapak's most exotic physical feature is a set of glands located under
the tongue. Male Kapaks continuously secrete a venomous spittle, while the
saliva of female Kapaks has remarkable healing properties.
 
Neither male nor female Kapaks show any aptitude toward original thinking,
nor are they very perceptive. This makes them better followers than leaders.
Another kind of draconian or a leader of a different species usually leads
Kapak forces.
 
TYPICAL CLASSES: Assassin, Spellfilcher
~

0 BOZAK~
Bozaks are bronze-scaled draconians who make use of magical talent and
often lead other draconians into battle.  Bozaks stand between 6 and 6 1/2
feet tall, with large horn-tipped wings that rise nearly a foot higher than
their shoulders.  They typically disdain armor in favor of maneuverability;
when they do wear armor, it is only of the lightest types.  Bozaks have
yellow or amber eyes and light gray teeth.  
 
Intelligent and ruthless, Bozaks have natural ability with arcane magic, but
are inclined to study divine magic as well. Some serve leadership roles in
draconian communities, while others organize religious services dedicated
to evil gods. Both male and female Bozaks have excellent instincts toward
organization and leadership.
 
TYPICAL CLASSES: Battlemage, Cleric
~

0 SIVAK~
Sivaks are silver-scaled draconians who use their innate powers to
disguise themselves among the enemy before attacking with savage fury. 
Sivaks are physically the largest of draconians.  The males stand between 8
1/2 and 9 feet tall, with females averaging half a foot shorter.  Sivak
draconians wear heavy armor when going into battle, but usually wear light
or no armor at all when engaged in stealth or scouting missions.  Sivak
armor is constructed to make room for their huge wings.  
 
Except for the extremely rare Auraks, Sivak draconians are the most
powerful and respected draconian race. They are often leaders in draconian
communities and military units. Sivaks are fond of strong drink, but like
the Baaz, alcohol has no effect on their ability to fight. Sivaks eat
virtually anything, and have a fondness for elven flesh.
 
TYPICAL CLASSES: Battlemage, Warrior, Knight, Ranger
~

0 AURAK~
Auraks are powerful and highly dangerous draconians who make extensive
use of magic.  Aurak draconians are tall and slender, standing between 6 1/2
and 7 feet in height at adulthood, with no distinguishing characteristics
between males and females.  They have short, stubby tails and long, sharp
fangs.  Unlike other draconians, they have no wings.  Aurak scales are
bright gold upon hatching, dulling somewhat with maturity.  Their eyes are
red, green, or black.  
 
Aurak draconians wear robes or decorate their bodies to indicate rank and
superiority. If necessary, they use spells to take whatever disguise suits
their needs. As the rarest of draconians, Auraks have never been known to
congregate in large numbers, though they are often found as part of a larger
group of draconians. They are both respected and feared by their fellows.
 
TYPICAL CLASSES: Necromancer, Enchanter, Illusionist, Conjuror
~

0 'CONCLAVE2'~
The Orders of High Sorcery are ruled by a representative council called
the Conclave of Wizards.  Seven archmages of each Order serve as a
delegation to the Conclave of Wizards.  One of the seven delegates from each
Order serves as the order's Master.  The means of selecting the Master vary
from order to order: White Robes hold an election, Red Robes draw lots from
the seven council members, and Black Robes hold contests to prove magical
prowess and domination.  Once a Master is chosen, he or she serves for life
unless convicted of a serious breach of loyalty or the Foundations of
Wizardry.  The Towermaster of the Conclave, the highest official in the
Order of High Sorcery, is elected from the twenty-one members of the High
Council.  
 
RACES: Humans are the most prolific members of the Conclave, turning to magic
for any number of reasons. Human drive, creativity, and adaptability are well
suited for the study of magic.
 
Magic is as natural to the elves as breathing or blinking. Elves view magic as
a gift to be nurtured and guided toward perfect harmony with the world. Elves
tend to be White Robe wizards. Any elf who shows inclination toward
embracing Red or Black Robes is deemed an outcast "dark elf". Those who choose
to follow the path of Neutrality or Evil sacrifice both homeland and family to
follow the magic.
 
Dwarven wizards are extremely rare, but not unheard of; especially amongst the
Theiwar and Daegar clans. But since magic is highly distrusted by dwarven
society, these dwarves are usually outcasts.
 
Gnomes exhibit a marked disdain for magic, preferring instead to rely on science
and technology. Gnomes are capable of using magic, but few realize they have
the potential.
 
Kender and magic are like oil and fire - a potentially dangerous combination. No
kender has ever taken the Test of High Sorcery (nor does there seem to be any
willingness among the wizards to allow a kender to take the Test). Though
kender may be interested in the effects of magic, they are unable to summon the
necessary focus required to master the magical arts.
 
Members of all other races, such as Sea elves, Minotaurs, and Draconians
operate outside the strictures of High Sorcery. There are records of minotaurs,
sea elves, and other, stranger creatures who have taken (and passed) the Test of
High Sorcery, buch such instances are so few as to be considered aberrations.
 
RENEGADES: When the gods of magic created the Orders of High Sorcery, they did
so to preserve the balance of magic in the world. Those who did not or would not
follow the laws of magic were to be considered renegades.
 
A renegade wizard is any wizard who exists outside the Orders of High Sorcery,
AND whose usage of magic is considered a threat to the balance as well as a
threat to the fragile image of Wizards of High Sorcery. A renegade wizard whose
magic is terrorizing a small village is still a wizard to the villagers, no
matter what kind of robes he wears.

Mere initiates, those who are deemed not strong enough to take the Test of High
Sorcery, are not considered a true threat. Those wizards whose hunger for power
drives them to use magic without regard for the strictures of magic, or those
who betrayed the Orders of High Sorcery, are dubbed true renegades.
 
For more information on each Order and the methods each uses to deal with
renegades, see: 'HELP WHITE ROBES', 'HELP RED ROBES', and 'HELP BLACK ROBES'.

RANKS OF THE CONCLAVE

{CThe Conclave shall adhere to the following ranks structure; all positions,
unless othwise noted, are to be granted solely by the Clan Leaders. Levels
listed are the MINIMUM required level for said rank, and do /not/ imply
automatic granting of any position upon reaching the stated Level.{x
 
1.  {RApprentice{x (20): After taking the test, a mage is ready to enter the
Conclave at the bottommost level and begin studying under a more advanced
Teacher.
 
2.  {RMage{x (30): Once his Teacher deems him ready, an Apprentice is granted
the title of Mage and given the full access and priviledges thereof. Mages
are expected to adhere to the strictures of their Order and patron deity,
and to observe the Foundations of Wizardry at all times. This rank may
only be achieved by the recommendation of a Teacher and the approval of
a High Mage of the Apprentice's Order or above.
 
3.  {RTeacher{x (50): Once a Mage's studies have progressed and he has shown
that he is capable of conducting himself, he may be called upon to pass his
knowledge of the Art on to younger wizards.  All Teachers will be
required to take on at least one Apprentice (ideally of the same Robe,
but determined on a case-by-case basis as needed).
 
4.  {RHigh Mage{x (70): A Mage who has proven his worth to the Conclave may
be deemed worthy of representing his fellow wizards as a member of the High
Council. Up to six High Mages may be chosen for each Order; the remaining
Council seat being reserved for the Masters of each Order. The High
Mages answer directly to the Masters, and may be called upon to carry
out the Council's orders directly.  High Mages are chosen by the current
Master of their chosen Order.  *NOTE* This is not the Leader of any of the
Orders, as the title has been used to denote up to this point.  A High Mage
is another step up the ladder and does not have Leader status.
 
{CNon Level-based Positions:{x
{RArchmage{x: While there is no level requirement, an Arch Mage must have
proven his worth both through ability and CONSISTANT Roleplay. This
pretitle may be granted ONLY by the request of a Master and approval by
Immortal staff.

{RMaster/Mistress{x: This pretitle is reserved for the Head of each Order,
(as determined under the guidelines in HELP CONCLAVE2). These are the
mortal leader positions, and require approval by the Immortal Leader of
the relevant Order (or an RP Immortal, ONLY IF there is no existing Imm
for that particular order).
 
{RTowermaster/mistress{x: The Head of the Conclave, as chosen from among
the three Masters. The Towermaster will continue to serve as the Master
of their respective Order. This position is to be elected by a majority
vote of the entire Conclave (including the Gods of Magic).

1 KOT2~
ORGANIZATION OF THE KNIGHTHOOD

{DThe Vision{x
The Vision is - in simple terms - a statement of the ultimate goal of the
knighthood.  For knights of Takhisis, the Vision is embodied in the phrase:
"One World Order."  The goal is no less than the total and unquestioned
domination of the entire world of Krynn.  The Blood Oath and the Code are
established to work toward that end.  
 
{rThe Blood Oath{x
The Blood Oath is simple: "Submit or die." When joining the knighthood, each
knight dedicates body and soul utterly to the cause. All thoughts of self are
submerged, sublimated in the will of the Dark Queen. Yet this does not mean
that knights may not think for themselves; instead, each knight is encouraged
to act in accordance with their own judgement under the guidelines of the Code.
 
{bThe Code{x
The Code is a complex system of laws created by Ariakan to provide discipline
and guidance to the Knighthood, while avoiding the strict, unyielding regulations
of the Solamnic Measure. Designed to relate primarily to military situations,
the Code can also be extended into the lives of each member of the knighthood.
Strict adherance is required, although each case is considered on its own merit
and exceptions may be made. The Code is primarily concerned with the following:
 
   LOYALTY: Be known for unwavering commitment to Takhisis and the Vision. There
   are many places where compromise is expected loyalty is not amongst them.
 
   PROWESS: To seek excellence in all endeavors expected of a knight, martial and
   otherwise, seeking strength to be used in the service of the Vision, rather than
   personal aggrandizement.
 
   FAITH: A Knight must place their faith in Takhisis, for faith roots him in the
   Vision and strengthens the Blood Oath. Weakness in faith is weakness in character.
   Neither are to be tolerated.
 
   COURAGE: Being a knight means choosing the more difficult path. Be prepared to
   make personal sacrifices in service of the Takhisis and the Vision.
 
   NOBILITY: Nobility lies in service to Takhisis and the Vision. Those who perform
   well in their duty and rise above their foes shall find favor in the eyes of
   the Queen. The weak, incompetent and disloyal shall not live to regret their failures.
~

1 'KOT JOIN'~
{BMembership in the Knights of Takhisis shall adhere to the following
restrictions and guidelines:{x

LEVEL: Any (Although lvl 20+ is recommended)

ALIGNMENT: Evil

ETHOS: Lawful or Neutral (Lawful preferred)

RELIGION: The Knighthood worships only the Dark Queen, Takhisis. However, in
          show of respect and gratitude, one day a year has been set aside in
          reverence of the sea goddess Zeboim, mother of Lord Ariakan.
 
CLASS RESTRICTIONS: The following classes will NOT be accepted - Blacksmith,
                    Bard, Thief, and Druid. All others may apply.
 
RACES: The Knighthood accepts the following races - Human, Half-elf, "Dark" Elves,
       Draconian, Dwarf, Minotaur and Ogre. **NOTE** While Draconians, Ogres and
       Minotaurs are often used as "shock troops", they are seen as "inferior"
       races by most, and are typically ineligible for full knighthood.
 
{WAPPLICATION PROCEDURE:{x
All those wishing to apply for the Knighthood must first submit a short
character "biography" detailing their personal background history and their
reasons for wanting to join the army of Takhisis. Notes should be sent to
TAKHISIS and include the Order you wish to join. All those found worthy will
be approached ICly by a knight who will then become that applicant's Advocate.
 
{DADVOCATES:{X
All beginning characters will start with a Patron (Lily), Sponsor (Skull), or
Mentor (Thorn). The Advocate will teach the Petitioner how to act as a member of
the Knights of Takhisis, and will travel with the Petitioner until they are deemed
ready to take the Test of Takhisis and become a Supplicant in the Order. After
this, the Supplicant may travel together with other knights without his Advocate
and fulfill tasks for the knighthood alone; however any failure of the Supplicant
will continue to reflect on their Advocate until the Supplicant advances to Acolyte
status and therefore is made a full member with all rights and responsibilities
of his Order.
 
The Advocate's commands and judgments are the final law and always unquestionably
obeyed. It is the responsibility of the Advocate to forward the advancement of the
character in the knighthood - or to kill the character who is disobedient. If needed,
the Advocate will hunt down and destroy the character without compassion if he or
she shows the least sign of disobedience to the Order. To do otherwise would bring
death on the Advocate from his or her own sponsor.

1 'KNIGHT LILY'~
{bKnights of the Lily{x

{D"Independence breeds chaos. Submit and be strong."{x

As with the Knights of Solamnia, any who would enter into the Knights of
Takhisis must begin as a Petitioner in the Order of the Lily.  All Knights
of Takhisis remain under the Order of the Lily until they attain the rank of
Night Warrior.  At this level, knights may choose entry into either Skull or
Thorn, or remain with the Lily.  The Knights of the Lily are the military
might of the knighthood and the center of political power as well.  The
Order of the Skull and the Order of the Thorn are seperate, with their own
particular skills and areas of responsibility.  While it may look to an
outsider as if the Knights of the Lily are the dominant force in the
knighthood, all three orders provide necessary functions and are considered
equal in power and authority, differing only in jurisdiction and function.  
~

1 KNIGHT SKULL~
{WKnights of the Skull{x

{D"Death is patient, flowing from without and within. Be vigilant in all and
skeptical of all."{x

These Knights form the clerical order of the knighthood, and their
higher-ranking members serve as Adjudicators of the Code.  They practice the
healing arts and are also in charge of both external intelligence and
internal security.  Skull Knights work their art by stealth and subtlety
rather than by force, leaving that to the other two orders.  Knights of the
Skull are clerics and their favored weapon is the heavy mace.  
 
Knights of the Skull are dedicated solely to the Queen of Darkness, to the
exclusion of all other gods and goddesses (including other dark deities). Her
Dark Majesty rewards such loyalty by appointing the most outstanding with the
rank of High Priest(ess) of Takhisis; a very sought-after position, and an
integral part of the Test of Takhisis. Those who go against his/her word usually
usually find themselves on the Dark Queen's bad side.
 
Although it is well known that the sea goddess Zeboim favors the Knighthood (in
honor of her son, Ariakan), the Skull Knights do not pray to her. However, it
is considered a matter of courtesy for all knights to ask Zeboim's blessing
during a sea voyage.
~

1 'KNIGHT THORN'~
{rKnights of the Thorn{x

{D"One who follows the heart finds it will bleed. Feel nothing but victory."{x

Knights of the Thorn are an order of wizards.  The Gray Robe Knights, as
they are known, operate completely outside the Towers of High Sorcery on
Ansalon - refusing to swear allegiance to any of the three robes (including
black), and are therefore considered renegade wizards by all members of the
Conclave.  The Thorn Knights work closely with Knights of the Skull in
maintaining order; both in conquered lands, and their own home territories. 
 
Unlike the Orders of High Sorcery, the Thorn Knights draw on the power of all
three of Krynn's moons as the source of their magic, rather than just one. Just
how they have accomplished this feat remains unknown. The Conclave is extremely
disturbed by the appearance of this new and powerful Order of sorcery; viewing
it as a distinct threat to themselves and the world at large, wizards of all
robes are exerting their combined efforts to both study and eradicate it.
~

1 'EAGLE EYE'~
Syntax: c 'eagle eye'
 
This spell allows a Ranger or a Druid to call for an Eagle's help through Telepathy,
asking it to scout the entire area the caster is in, and to report back it's
findings. The Eagle will report back to the caster all of the people it has
found in the immediate area. The Eagle can only see as good as the Caster. It
can't see people that the Caster can not normally see at the time. An example would
be if a person is Invisible, or Hidden. The Eagle can't see indoors either,
so anybody in the vicinity that is inside, won't be included in the report. This
spell can only be cast outdoors as well. Due to the required energy needed
to cast this spell, even failure means mental fatigue, rendering the spell un-
castable for a short period of time.
~

1 'CALL OF THE WILD'~
Syntax: c 'call of the wild'
 
This spell allows a Druid or a Ranger to magically make any wild animals near him
or her to start going crazy. The animals start shrieking as loud as they can,
producing a noise loud enough to make everyone caught in the middle to go deaf,
all save for the caster and his or her group members. The deafening effect can
affect a Mage's abilities to cast spells effectively one-hundred percent of the
time. Being deaf has other minor affects as well.
~

1 'ROLEPLAYING ETHICS' 'PLAYERKILLING ETHICS'~
The words ROLEPLAYING and PKING were used together as this help file
includes both, together as a whole, rather than just one of them
separately.
 
If you haven't read the help files on PLAYERKILLING and ROLEPLAYING, then
do so now. Make sure to read the WHOLE thing for each of them, and
understand them to the best of your ability. Now, onto Player Killing and
the Roleplay involved/required leading up to that point. In the HELP PK
file, it clearly states that one must have a motive for killing another
player. They must also be able to explain themselves (This means to an
Immortal if questioned, OR a Solamnic Knight if it involves being charged
with a crime).
 
Some of the BIGGEST Myths and Misconceptions about PKing include:
 
  ** #1 - You must Roleplay your motives/reasons for why your going to PK
     someone PRIOR to actually attacking them, through SAY's or other In
     Character means of communication.
 
- This is completely wrong! Your motives do NOT need to be justified by
telling the soon-to-be-victim WHY you're going to PK them through IC
channels. It is totally acceptable to walk up and PK a person without
giving any heads-up at all. Notifying someone what you're GOING to do
only gives them a head start to either get away, log off, or call for some
backup, which would all be (more or less) Out Of Character reactions.

Now, there ARE stipulations to this and they include, but are not limited to:
 
  a) You can't just log on, and go PK someone within a few heartbeats of
having logged on. This would be obvious to show there's no way you had
any RP merit to kill that person (unless of course, something took place
during a previous login that was not yet settled).
 
  b) You can't just walk up to characters you've NEVER even met before in
the GAME. Even *IF* you know it's someone's ALT, you still haven't met
that character in the game, IN CHARACTER, hence, your character doesn't
really KNOW that character at all.
 
  c) You attack someone and/or their ALTS because you don't like them
OOCly. This is one of the BIGGEST no-no's in the game, and will result in
an instant loss (Denial) of your character.

  d) You can't attack them more than ONCE in a 24 hour REAL LIFE time
period. As it states in HELP PK, it's only justifiable to kill them more
than once IF and ONLY IF, they seek retribution by trying to attack you,
yet you win.
 
  e) The player is obviously a Newbie. Attacking newbies, especially those
who don't even know what in the hell is going on as far as your entire
Roleplay storyline will result in your character ALSO being denied.
 
  ** #2 - You've killed a player but aren't allowed to do anything to or with their EQ.
 
- You can do anything you want to their corpse. Feel free to loot, burn,
pillage, sodomize, or anything you feel is just and IN Character to their
corpse.
 
Folks, you can PK for whatever reasons you want, just make sure it can be
justified if you are ever questioned by an Immortal. If you get PK'd by
someone, and don't feel that it was for any Roleplay reason whatsoever,
try talking to that person, the one who attacked you, through TELLS or any
other means available to you. If that person is unresponsive, and you
can't think of any other way to get even on your own, send a NOTE to
Immortal, with a brief LOG of what took place if you can. PK's are going
to happen, learn to deal with them without looking for an Immortal crutch.

If it gets out of hand (And we can see logs of every PK attempt/success
that takes place), we will step in and deal harsh punishments. If, however,
everyone starts whining about a PK attempt/success regardless of the
reasons, it will start turning this MUD into a Political MUD, with players
and staff alike, debating over the logic of what happened, what should
have happened, and who should receive disciplinary action. That's not fun
for anyone, and our goal here is to entertain, not to babysit or to start
resorting to Political Debates.

1 'ENFORCING ROLEPLAY' 'ENFORCING RP' 'ENFORCE RP' 'ENFORCE ROLEPLAYING'~
This HELP file is available to ALL players and staff alike, to read,
although it is here to serve more as a guideline of expectations of the
Immortal Staff Staff when it comes to enforcing Roleplay, and gives the
Players an idea of what we look for and what we do when it comes to
enforcing Roleplay.  
 
Lets start with the very basics, since the biggest misconceptions of enforcing
roleplay comes from the meaning of the words. We an Enforced Roleplaying MUD. This
means that we ENFORCE Roleplay when deemed neccissary. However, we do not FORCE
Roleplay, or at least should NOT be forcing RP. There's a BIG difference between
those two. The best analogy that could be given so people can have a better
understanding of the difference between the two, would be to use our great Police
Enforcement Agencies, or Public Safety, depending on where you live, as an example.
Their JOB is to ENFORCE the LAW, however, as most of you can testify either
by personal experience or by other means, Police like to FORCE the law onto people,
rather than protect us and ENFORCE the law. For example, when it comes to having
paraphernalia in an automobile, it is against the law and it is up to the Police
to enforce that law, by such means as handing punishing those who fail to uphold
to that law by say, getting caught with a gigantic water bong sitting in the front
seat when the person gets pulled over for a different traffic violation. However,
when a Policeman pulls someone over and can't see any Paraphernalia in plain view,
but for whatever reason, decides he wants to do an illegal search of the car without
concent or a warrent, and only by this, FINDS something, that is no longer considered
to be ENFORCING the LAW, but now that Policeman is FORCING the LAW. If you still
can't see the difference, many other examples can be given. Police HARRASSING
citizens by doing things like tailing you when your driving, etc., or profiling
you because of the way you look, dress, smell, act, etc. is no longer ENFORCING
the law, but now FORCING the LAW.
 
We do NOT want that here at all. Immortal Staff members are expected to ENFORCE
Roleplay, which does NOT mean that you POOF into a room with a player, or switch
into a MOB that's in the same room as a player, then try Roleplaying with the
player and if the player decides to ignore it, or decides that he/she doesn't want
to Roleplay the situation the Immortal is presenting, to severely PUNISH that
player. Punishing a player for non-roleplaying antics should ONLY be dealt out
in situations like when a player outright makes it a point to be against the MUD's
Roleplaying enviroment by making statements out of character to other players.
Another situation could be if a player purposely sabotages other people's RP. For
example, if Bob and Jim are Roleplaying at a temple, and Frank walks into the
room and starts making fun of their Roleplay, or starts Roleplaying really
idiotic with intensions of ruining Bob and Jim's Roleplay, then a severe RP
punishment would be justifiable. Punishments should be dealt with by deducting
Experience Points from said person. In no way should an Immortal start casting
offensive spells, or chasing after to kill the person, or start harrassing the
player, or anything of the like. We are professionals and should act like it. We
are NOT to lower ourselves by seeking retribution through childish means against
a player for bad RP.
 
Enforcing Roleplay also includes setting GOOD examples to the players. This doesn't
mean snooping people, seeing that they keep using OOC content in IC channels, then
poofing to them and start throwing a hissy fit by yelling at them and telling them
that they aren't suppose to do that. Be tactful and lead by example. Tactfully
tell them that using OOC content in IC channels is wrong. Notify them of which
channels are IC and which ones are OOC if they do not know. Give them examples of
what would be good IC content and what would be not. If they are treated in this
manner, they will be more likely to try harder at Roleplaying and less likely to
hold a grudge against that Immortal and/or start hostile name-calling. Treat every
player with respect, and you shall be respected back.
 
We are a Roleplay Enforced MUD, we are NOT an RPI (Role Play Intensive) MUD. The
difference is, that an RPI MUD is about as close to a MUSH as you can get, without
actually being a MUSH. RPI MUD's are extreme, and hardly have any actual Game Play.
Roleplay Enforced means that we will help to enforce Roleplay, but hey, if a player
decides one day that all he wants to do is be alone, or with a buddy of his, and
just wants to go around and kill for Experience Points, then so be it, leave them
alone. As long as they are having FUN, that is what is most important. We will
NEVER bend this MUD to accept only a certain group of individuals. In other words,
this MUD will NOT be a MUD that is only FUN to the Hack 'n' Slash players, NOR will
it ever be a MUD that is only FUN for the Serious Roleplay Adventurers. We want to
maintain a good equal balance of fun and entertainment for both types of people,
or at least we need to try. If they aren't having FUN because of the actions of a
certain Immortal, then you aren't doing your job correctly and need to readjust
your ways of thinking.

1 'TAME'~
Syntax: tame <victim>
 
This skill allows a skilled Ranger or Druid to be able to tame animals out in the
wild. This can only be done on Animals. Anything else will result in failure and
even the possibility of upsetting the non-animal, provoking them to attack. This
skill can only be used out in the wild. It will not work on animals in cities
and places of the like.
~

1 'ENTANGLE'~
Syntax: cast 'entangle' <victim>
 
This spell can only be used by the Masters of Nature, the Druids. By using this
spell, the caster calls forth Vines from his or her surroundings, which then
tightly grip around their victim's legs, immobilizing them. This spell can only
be cast in particular locations, such as Forest, Mountains, Hills, Fields, and it
can even be cast underwater, calling forth the water vines deep in the seas.
~

1 'WISDOM OF MAJERE'~
Followers of Majere embrace the goal of Wisdom through strict
self-discipline and meditation. While many who follow Majere go out into
the world to teach the ways of enlightenment and counter the lies and
temptations of evil, all receive their initial training through monasteries.
Though Majere's following is small, his clerics are among the most
influential on Krynn, and comprise some of the greatest theologians and
teachers throughout history.

Followers of Wisdom adhere to a strict monastic lifestyle, taking vows
of poverty, obedience, and chastity in order to focus on achieving
enlightenment and holiness through the denial of worldly temptations.
Those who follow this lifestyle tend to prefer unarmed forms of martial
arts - many in order to learn physical and spiritual control, others in an
effort to both receive and spread spiritual enlightenment; preferring to
focus on clarifying and understanding the doctrines of the deities of
Good.
 
Followers of Wisdom are most often of Lawful ethos, Good alignment, or
both. Those of Chaotic ethos typically find the rigid discipline of
monastic life too limiting and seek out other, less restrictive ways of
serving the cause of Good.
 
Those wishing to receive the Mark of true enlightenment must often spend
hours, days, or even weeks in a state of fasting, meditation and prayer.
If the follower shows remarkable focus and discipline, Majere himself
will occasionally grant a puzzle or task through which the seeker may
attain a fraction of the god's wisdom.
 
All who embrace the path to Wisdom are guided by the following tenets:
 
  ** Seek holiness both by overcoming the Evil within and opening
     yourself to Good.
  ** Discipline the unruly passions of the body, and look within to find
     your own faults and strengths.
  ** Seek not glory or perishable things, but the eternal joy of light
  ** Obey those properly set above you, and be gentle but firm to those
     below
  ** Help call others to virtue through teaching and example, not force
     and fear
  ** Oppose evil with fervor, but without hatred
  ** Show mercy when possible, but be hard when necessary
~

1 'GUARDIANS' 'GUARDS'~
Each clan has guards or guardians placed throughout the clan's base of
operations.  These mobs can not be charmed, summoned, nor can they move. 
However, these guards or guardians will protect the Clan Hall from outsiders
(Anyone not in the perspective clan).  Each Clan Member has the ability to
control these guardians in three (3) ways.  They can make them Go on Alert,
Go on Duty, or Go off Duty.  To do this, you must be first in the same room
as the guardian.  Then, using the SAY channel, you can SAY one of the
following three things: 
 
go on alert
 
go on duty
 
go off duty
 
Now, each one of these will put the Guardian into a different mode of protection.
Each one will be described here.
 
* Go On Alert - This command makes the Guardian become fully alert. This means that
                chances are, they will attack anyone who tries to enter the clan
                and yet does NOT belong to that clan. The only way around this for
                the player being attacked, is to outright KILL them.
 
* Go On Duty  - This state of protection, makes the Guardian be more attentive as
                to who comes into the Clan Hall. They do NOT attack people, but will
                rather show them the way out (to the front entrance of the Clan)
                if they do not belong in the clan. There IS a 40 percent chance that
                the Guardians will only notice the player AFTER they have moved to
                the next room, which means they won't stop the player, but, the
                Guardians WILL send a Clan Tell to all fellow clan members as to WHO
                has entered the Clan.
 
* Go Off Duty - This command will make the Guardian become more relaxed in his 
                duties. He will allows anyone, in or out of the clan, into the Clan
                Hall.
 
Now, it should be noted that when you USE these commands on a Guard or Guardian,
that it will *ONLY* affect the Guard or Guardian in the room with you that you are
giving orders to. It will *NOT* affect the rest of the Guards or Guardians that
are in the rest of the Clan Hall. Each one must be individually set. It should
also be noted that if a Copyover or Reboot of the MUD takes place, ALL Guards or
Guardians WILL revert to a default state, which is the same as the Go On Duty
command. These Guards or Guardians CAN be killed. They are not meant to keep ALL
players out 100 percent of the time. They are of higher level, so it is not highly
recommended to go charge in a clan not of your own, and start trying to raise hell
with the Guards or Guardians by killing them, if your of a significant lower level.
~

1 'HEROIC DEMISE'~
This skill is automatic.  It does not require any input by the player,
just requires that the player have the skill.  When the player who has this
skill dies, there is a chance that he or she will be able to deal a good
amount of damage to their foe, right before dying.  When the player has been
struck the last fatal blow or spell, he or she pulls out a dagger and lunges
it into their foe, which will leave them with only one-tenth of their total
hit points left.  If the foe of the soon-to-be-dead in a second, already has
less than that amount already, nothing happens.  
~

1 'ENDURE DISEASE'~
Syntax: cast 'endure disease'
 
This spell will produce a misty green cloud of smoke, which will then
circle around the caster, then enter the caster's body through any and all open
orifices, mouth, nose, skin pores, etc.. This spell gives the caster endurance
against disease type spells. Those type of spells include, but not limited to,
Plague, Poison, and Gas Breath. In the case of Gas Breath, the damage is still
done, however the chances of being affected by the spell's side affect, being
poisoned, are greatly reduced. This spell reduces these affects by 65 percent. So,
any of these spells cast on the affected person, only have a 35 percent chance of
success.
~

0 'CHIVALRY' 'CHIVALRY RELIGION'~
While Habbakuk tends to be followed by rangers, sailors, farmers or
anyone else with strong ties to the bounty of land and sea, the actual
clergy is divided between clerics and druids.  Clerics of Habbakuk have no
central authority to which they answer, nor are they strictly organized. 
Instead, the followers of the Fisher King serve to protect nature from those
who would destroy or squander it.  
 
Followers typically serve their communities by looking after herd animals,
protecting the community from animal attacks, planting saplings, guarding
against forest fires and assisting those who show respect for nature. Clerics
of Habbakuk may also be found working alongside healers of Mishakal.
 
Followers of Habbakuk tend to be of any ethos, though always of Good
alignment. Once during their lifetime, followers must leave friends and
family to wander the land; taking nothing but a walking stick and the
clothes on their back. This 'wandering period' serves to purify the
follower and help them to learn the true ways of nature and their god.
The wandering ends when the follower has either performed a service for
their god or Habbakuk send the follower a sign.
 
Those who would follow Habbakuk are charged to live by the following:
 
  ** Live in harmony with nature and respect all living things

  ** Treat animals well, for they are a gift from the gods

  ** Those who seek to spoil or squander the land are the enemy

  ** Be prepared to fight in defense of the land and the creatures in
     your care
~

0 'JUSTICE' 'JUSTICE RELIGION'~
The followers of Kiri-Jolith serve Justice by seeking out evil and
tyranny in all of its forms in order to wage war against them.  Whether
defending their communities from hostile incursions, or liberating those
under the weight of oppression, followers of Justice are among the most
active in the fight against those who serve darkness.  

Those worshipping the god of righteous warfare tend to be mainly
comprised of knights, warriors and battle-clerics. Clerics of
Kiri-Jolith train daily and diligently to be prepared in the never ending
fight against Evil. Wherever they serve, these clerics are organized
with military precision, and each knows their place within the ranks.
Followers of Justice speak often of their faith, inspiring others with
their courage and honor. Most devout followers of Kiri-Jolith join the
ranks of the Solamnic Knights, seeking their place within the Order of
the Sword.
 
Followers of Justice are most often of Lawful ethos, Good alignment, or
both. Those of Chaotic ethos typically find the military discipline of
Kiri-Jolith too restrictive and seek out other, less regimented ways of
serving the cause of Good.
 
Those wishing to be Mark'ed by their god must typically perform some
great deed involving righting some unjust action and/or helping those in
great need. All who follow the ways of Justice adhere to the following
principles:

  ** Good is its own reward

  ** Honor and courage are life - Cowardice is to be reviled

  ** Never refuse to fight for a cause that is just

  ** Never retreat while an evil opponent remains on the battlefield

~

0 'BLESSING' 'BLESSING RELIGION'~
The followers of Mishakal are among the most numerous and active of the
priesthoods throughout Krynn, actively helping those in need and promoting
the Blessing of their goddess wherever they can.  Instrumental in bringing
about the word of the gods during the War of the Lance, they work tirelessly
to bring peace and comfort among the troubled people of Krynn.  
 
Clerics of Mishakal are required by their goddess to heal anyone who asks,
regardless of alignment. While some may charge for their services (sometimes
quite expensively for those who are evil), Mishakal forbids her clerics from
withholding their services from those who cannot afford it. In addition,
clerics of Mishakal often officiate at significant events such as births,
deaths and marriages; blessing newborns, offering comfort and last rites
to the dying, and consecrating vows.
 
All followers of Mishakal must work toward the good of the community in
which they live, and often travel extensively.  Followers may be of any
ethos, but MUST be of Good alignment. Those wishing to receive the full
Blessing of Mishakal must strive constantly to heal the ills of those around
them and minister to all creatures. This may often involve actively working
against the disease and decay spread by Morgion and his worshippers.
 
Those who would devote their lives to the Blue Lady's Blessing must adhere
to the following, set forth in the legendary Disks of Mishakal:

  ** Heal all who require it, be they friend or foe
  ** Drive out disease and decay and bring light to those who live in
     darkness and ignorance
  ** Promote peace and harmony and lend help to those who cannot help
     themselves
  ** Do not raise weapons in anger, but defend yourself and those whose
     lives are in danger
  ** Honor those who have passed on, but remember that your duties lie with
     those who are left behind
~

0 'VIRTUE' 'VIRTUE RELIGION'~
The followers of Virtue devote their lives to championing the deities of
Good; leading by example and encouragement, rather than restriction. 
Concerned chiefly with the welfare of all the peoples of Krynn, they serve
to aid Paladine in the defense of his beloved creation against Evil.  
 
Devotees of the Master of Law, the followers of Virtue believe that a
government that is good and just is necessary for a free and stable
society. As such, they often work side by side with the rulers of the
regions they inhabit, serving their communities as judges, advisors,
counselors and law enforcement officials.
 
Clerics of Paladine focus on providing spiritual guidance to the people.
While the clergy of Mishakal tend to the healing of the body, the Revered
Sons and Daughters of Paladine tend to the healing of the spirit; helping
the weak and defenseless, counseling the common folk on matters of faith,
and providing shelter to those they feel are wrongly accused.
 
As Paladine is the Father of Good and Master of Law, his followers tend to
be of Lawful ethos and Good alignment without exception. While many devote
themselves in name, true blessings come only to those who embrace the
tenets of Virtue wholeheartedly. Paladine's favor is generally bestowed
upon those who, by their dedication and example, lead others to dedicate
their lives to the cause of Good.
 
All those who would live in Virtue live by the following code:
 
  ** The guilty must be brought before the law
  ** Good stands in contrast to Evil - neither can exist without the other
  ** Good redeems its own
  ** While the whole may be greater than the sum of its parts, each part
     is no less important. The greatest events in history are but a series
     of small moments.
  ** None are so lost that they cannot be brought to see the light
~

0 'NATURE RELIGION'~
The followers of Chislev embrace Nature in all its forms and defend the
wilderness against those who would do it harm.  Composed mainly of druids,
the church of Chislev welcomes all who would care for the natural world. 
Here and there, a few clerics may be found tending to small farming
communities or, in the case of elven societies, tending to the ancestral
forests surrounding their homeland.  
 
As the most devout of Nature's worshippers, druids of Chislev spend their
days traveling their protected areas, however large or small, and
correcting any imbalances they may find. Mornings are typically spent
healing animals and keeping watch for poachers or those setting snares or
traps unlawfully and without regard to the hazards of depopulation.
Afternoons are spent tending to the trees and plants of Chislev's domain.
Each spring, many of Chislev's clergy are welcomed by local communities
as they travel the land, blessing the crops in hopes of yielding a good
harvest. Many can be found working alongside those devoted to Habbakuk
to restore areas damaged by war, fire, or other unnatural causes.
 
Just as nature yields many creatures both dangerous and benign, followers
of Chislev come in many varieties. Devotees of Chislev may be of any
combination of ethos and alignment, so long as one or the other remains
Neutral. Those wishing to earn Chislev's favor must typically undertake
some quest involving the protection and/or restoration of an endangered
wilderness area, or combating those who would harm or corrupt it.
 
Followers of Chislev adhere to the following laws of Nature:
 
  ** The balance of nature must be maintained at all costs

  ** Nature should be protected and nurtured, not spoiled or enslaved

  ** There is a place for man-made things and innovation, but they should
     always come second to the true gift that is nature.
~

0 'REDMAGIC' 'RED MAGIC' 'REDMAGIC RELIGION' 'RED MAGIC RELIGION'~
The followers of Lunitari delicately tread the path of Neutrality, working
to balance Good and Evil, and often acting as the moderating voice of
reason and peace. While the forces of Good and Evil continue to vie for
control over the other, the forces of Neutrality seek only to maintain the
balance that keeps the world moving.
 
Lunitari has no clerical order, but rather is honored and respected as the
patron deity of the Red Robed order of the Conclave of High Sorcery. Her
followers are generally more numerous than those of Solinari or Nuitari,
and work to maintain the delicate balance that exists between good and
evil magic.
 
In keeping with the teachings and aims of Lunitari, all who would study
Red Magic may be of any combination of ethos and alignment, so long as one
or the other remains Neutral. Should a red-robed mage stray from these
beliefs, he or she may soon find themselves out of favor with their
goddess. Humans are by far the most prolific of Lunitari's followers,
though by no means exclusive. 
 
RESTRICTIONS: Certain races may be deemed unacceptable for the blessings
of Lunitari. These generally include: 

  ** Thaewar and Daergar: while dwarven wizards are not unheard of, these
     clans in particular are known for their tendency toward dark magic
  ** Gnomes: most gnomes exhibit a strong distaste for magic, preferring
     to rely on science and technology. While they may be capable of using
     magic, few realize they have the potential; indeed, calling a Gnome a
     wizard is considered by most to be a deadly insult.
  ** Kender: While kender are often very interested in the effects of
     magic, due to their inherent nature they are unable to maintain the
     necessary focus needed to master the magical arts.
  ** Draconians: the very existence of these creatures and the manner of
     their creation is an affront to the strictures of Neutrality.
  ** Elves: While red-robed elven wizards are not unheard of, elven
     society is so devoted to the gods of Good, that the practice of any
     but White magic is considered heresy and may well lead to the
     individual being branded a 'dark elf' and exiled from his or her
     homeland in shame. This is especially true among the Silvanesti.
 
Other races wishing to receive the blessings of Lunitari may do so at the
goddess' discretion. While recorded instances of sea elves, minotaurs and
others do exist, they are generally so few as to be considered aberrations.
 
Those followers wishing to receive a MARK of Lunitari's favor must often
undertake a quest of some sort involving the search for rare magical
artifacts, the use of magic to maintain the balance between the forces of
Good and Evil, or the gathering of "stray" mages into the fold. 
 
All mages MARK'ed by the goddess are asked to include themselves in the
Conclave of Wizards as a sign of solidarity and dedication to the Art.
Once accepted, Red mages are often the first choice for negotiators and
ambassadors of the Conclave, as well as dealing with Renegade wizards
Followers of Red Magic will attempt to bring their brethren before the
council, but will not hesitate to use force when reason fails.

The defining guidelines among followers of Red Magic are as follows:

  ** Devote yourself to Magic.
  ** Enhance and expand the use of magic in the world.
  ** Work to maintain the balance between Good and Evil magic
  ** Promote the use of Neutral magic, and bring other worthy candidates
     to the study of the Art.
~

0 'BLACKMAGIC' 'BLACKMAGIC RELIGION' 'BLACK MAGIC' 'BLACK MAGIC RELIGION'~
The followers of Nuitari embrace the cause of Evil, working to promote
their own ambitions and increase their power in the world through the use
of Black Magic. They believe that true power lies in the dark sides of all
creatures; magic is a tool to that power, and is to be pursued without
ethical or moral restraint, since magic itself is beyond such
considerations.
 
Nuitari has no clerical order, but rather is honored and respected as the
patron deity of the Black Robed order of the Conclave of High Sorcery.
Followers of Black Magic are taught that magic is secretive and that its
power is to be coveted. Those who use their magic to gain power are often
seduced by Nuitari, who promises them they will gain powerful magic much
faster if they worship him rather than his more cautious cousins.
 
In keeping with the teachings and aims of Nuitari, those who would devote
themselves to the study of Black Magic are typically of Lawful or Neutral
ethos and Evil alignment. Should a black-robed mage stray from these
beliefs, he or she will soon find themselves incurring the jealous wrath
of their god. Humans, Thaewar, and Daergar are by far the most prolific of
Nuitari's followers, though by no means exclusive.
 
RESTRICTIONS: Certain races may be deemed unworthy for the blessings of
Nuitari. These generally include: 

  ** Gnomes: most gnomes exhibit a strong distaste for magic, preferring
     to rely on science and technology. While they may be capable of using
     magic, few realize they have the potential; indeed, calling a Gnome a
     wizard is considered by most to be a deadly insult.
  ** Kender: While kender are often very interested in the effects of
     magic, due to their inherent nature they are unable to maintain the
     necessary focus needed to master the magical arts.
  ** Draconians: while certain draconians have exhibited a talent for
     magic, most reject Nuitari in favor of Queen Takhisis herself.
  ** Elves: While black-robed elven wizards are not unheard of, elven
     society is so devoted to the gods of Good, that the practice of any
     but White magic is considered heresy and may well lead to the
     individual being branded a 'dark elf' and exiled from his or her
     homeland in shame. This is especially true among the Silvanesti, from
     which arose one of the most famous black-robed elves in recent
     history, Dalamar the Dark.
 
Other races wishing to receive the blessings of Nuitari may do so at the
god's discretion. While recorded instances of sea elves, minotaurs and
others do exist, they are generally so few as to be considered aberrations.

Those followers wishing to receive a MARK of Nuitari's favor must often
undertake a quest of some sort involving the search for rare magical
artifacts, the use of magic to attain a certain degree of wealth and/or
power, or the hunting and destruction of renegade mages.

All mages MARK'ed by the god are asked to include themselves in the
Conclave of Wizards as a sign of solidarity and dedication to the Art.
Once accepted, Black-robed mages are among the most relentless pursuers of
renegade mages. Followers of Black Magic will attempt to bring any
renegades into their ranks, often destroying them without hesitation if
they refuse.
 
Nuitari's laws of Black Magic are clear and simple:
 
  ** Serve magic and serve me

  ** Magic is power - keep it secret and keep it safe
~

0 'BATTLE RELIGION'~
Followers of Reorx are comprised mainly of dwarves and gnomes, both of
which consider themselves the "chosen" race of the god. The church of
Reorx is known for its stability and organization as much as for its
workmanship and invention.

The dwarven branch of Reorx's church is led by a dwarven cleric called the
Starmaster. The rest of the dwarven clergy are known as "Forgers" and
wield great influence within their clans. Blacksmiths of many races also
revere Reorx, and these devotees are expected to work from morning to
evening unless traveling (even then, the smith may take along a portable
forge) or presiding over church ceremonies.

The gnomish branch of the church does not wield as much worldly influence,
but works closely with the priesthood of Sirrion to produce much of the
necessary metals for gnomish inventions. Most gnomes serve Reorx through
the pursuit of their Life Quests.
 
Followers of Reorx may be of any combination of ethos and alignment, so
long as one or the other remains neutral. True devotees to the god of
Battle and the Forge that wish to receive a Mark of Reorx's favor must
create, during his or her lifetime, a metal object of some type that
honors Reorx. This object/invention must be made by the follower's own
hands and possess extraordinary quality or artistic value. This work can
often take years to complete.

All who follow the teachings of Reorx follow these laws of the Forge:

  ** There is beauty in creation
  ** Nothing is better in life than crafting something lasting, and the
     process is just as important as the finished product
  ** Never be idle when you can be working
  ** Tried and true methods are well and good, but innovation is vitally
     important
  ** Always strive to master your skills, honor your peers and enjoy the
     results of your work
~

0 WEALTH~
Followers of Wealth are mainly composed of merchants, mercenaries,
traders, and the occasional rogue. Some travel the land assisting
struggling business owners, serving as moneylenders, and supporting
various guilds and business ventures.

Followers of Shinare are industrious, working hard to amass wealth and
prestige, but they must not be greedy - that way lies the dark path to
Hiddukel. Rather, devotees of Wealth must work to improve the area in
which they live for the profit of the community as well as themselves.
Followers of Shinare are forbidden from being late in the payment of taxes,
tithes or other expenses, and from cheating in any way whatsoever when it
comes to matters of finance.

Devotees of Shinare are typically of Lawful or Neutral ethos, and Neutral
alignment. Those wishing to earn a sign of Shinare's favor must have
amassed a certain amount of personal wealth, and are often charged with
finding some sort of business venture in which to invest.

Those devoted to Wealth and industry live by the following code:

  ** Work hard and you will be rewarded by wealth
  ** Greed will destroy what you have worked to gain
  ** Poverty is lack of effort - never tolerate laziness
  ** Lead others in enterprise and safeguard all transactions
  ** Be fair and honest in business, for deception is the road to ruin
  ** Competition is the wellspring of all fortune
~

0 'FLAME' 'FLAME RELIGION'~
Followers of Sirrion are often passionate in nature, yet erratic and
changeable. Those who desire only power are scorned by the god, as
destruction is the realm of Sargonnas. Instead, those who follow the way
of Flame do so for its beauty and transformational qualities.

Clerics of Sirrion must tend to an ever-burning fire in their home or
temple, meditating upon it as a symbol of the inner fire of the soul. Days
are usually spent tending to communal fires such as those in smithies,
taverns, and other public places. Now and again during the evenings,
followers of Sirrion may build bonfires; causing the flames to dance and
change color in order to entertain and teach others about their own inner
fires.

Sirrion accepts followers of all alignments, though only of Chaotic ethos -
as unpredictable and ever-changing as the fire he embodies. Those wish to
be Marked by the god's Flame must teach others to respect and revere the
power and beauty of fire, and use that fire to either transform something
for the benefit of others or keep it from turning destructive (aiding in the
control and saving of forest and city fires would be an example of this).
 
Followers of Sirrion are required to live by the following flames of truth:
 
  ** Fire is life, fire is death
  ** Fire is honest and does not discriminate
  ** Fire is the instrument of change
  ** Remove the fear of fire from the people and teach them all the good
     things that fire can do for them
  ** Harness flame to bring light and warmth into the world
  ** Never allow a fire to rage out of control, for all flame that burns
     should have a purpose

0 'LIFE' 'LIFE RELIGION'~
Zivilyn is often said to be the wisest of the gods. Known as the "Tree
of Life", Zivilyn teaches his followers that wisdom transcends both Good
and Evil, and is a force unto itself. Followers of Zivilyn can be found
all over Krynn, serving as counselors, mediators, philosophers and
diplomats. Occasionally, if no cleric of Paladine can be found, Zivilyn's
followers may be seen acting as legal officials or advisors in trials.

Unlike those of Gilean, followers of Zivilyn prefer to facilitate rather
than teach, encouraging others to learn through experience rather than
cloistered research and study. Recognizing that wisdom comes with age,
the highest ranks of Zivilyn's clergy are reserved for the eldest of their
order. Those who follow the Life Tree are calm and deliberate, never
making rash decisions or giving way to fits of temper. Much like the
Aesthetic order, Zivilyn's followers remain uninvolved in the struggle for
supremacy between Good and Evil, and are not swayed by impassioned pleas
or bribery of any sort.

Devotees of Zivilyn may be of any combination of ethos and alignment, so
long as at least one or the other remains Neutral. Straying from this path
may well cause the follower to be forsaken by their god. Those wishing to
be marked by the wisdom of Life are often called upon to solve one or more
tests of wisdom, or some life lesson presented in the form of a riddle
that the devotee is required to solve through the wisdom of his or her own
life experience.

All who embrace the tenets of Zivilyn live by the following Life lessons:

  ** Wisdom is timeless. Act only after you have studied all courses
     of action
  ** Be free of material influence, choose no side in war or conflict
  ** Seek understanding, not facts, for knowledge is fallible whereas
     wisdom is not
  ** All wisdom comes from within - it cannot be learned or borrowed
  ** Be an advisor to those who seek peace
  ** Be at peace with Nature, for it is the cradle of wisdom, and be at
     peace with yourself, for you are the vessel of wisdom
~

0 'DEATH RELIGION'~
Followers of Chemosh seek to undermine the works of the orders of Good,
turning mortals away from life to the mockery of life offered by their
god. Most cult members work in secret, expanding their numbers through
false promises of Immortality. In turn, this secrecy means that the church
of Chemosh has no central authority. Many clerics hold their positions for
generations, using their powers to cling to control even after death.

Devotees of Chemosh may be of any ethos, but are ALL of evil alignment.
Should they stray from this path, the individual will surely find
themselves incurring their god's wrath. Those who wish to be marked by
the Lord of Death must undertake some special task of the god's
choosing for some, this may take lifetimes to complete.

The tenets followed by worshippers of Chemosh do not necessarily reflect
the god's true views, for the beliefs he fosters are intended to dupe
mortals into his control. These tenets are as follows:

  ** The world issued from Chaos, who has no purpose or grand plan for it
  ** Mortals have no souls; the flesh is all that matters
  ** Death is a gateway to oblivion
  ** The gods of Good promise life after death to enslave their
     worshippers; service to Chemosh is rewarded with true everlasting life
~

0 'CORRUPTION' 'CORRUPTION RELIGION'~
Very few people willingly become followers of Hiddukel. Usually, the
deity tricks a person into service, at the cost of their soul. Followers
of Hiddukel are ordered to pursue and attain wealth, prestige and
influence by any means necessary, and seek to get the best of everyone in
any and all bargains. Clerics of Hiddukel operate in secret, under the
guise of legitimate concerns, and large cities are often home to hidden
cells of his worshippers.

Those who follow the god of Corruption often lead double lives, appearing
as respected members of the community by day and conducting illicit
activity by night. Hiddukel prizes treachery in his followers, even when
their treachery turns against him. Every follower works for themselves,
constantly scheming and backstabbing to gain dominance over the others.
Every year, followers of Hiddukel must present the god with a tally of
those they have either corrupted or driven into ruin. Those who fail face
the wrath of the god.

Hiddukel's followers are typically Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral, or
Neutral Evil. Those wishing to obtain the mark of their god's favor must
undertake a particular quest, often involving some form of swindle or
corrupting others to betray those dear to them.

Followers of Hiddukel live by the following creed:

  ** Greed is the driving force in the world
  ** Those who deny that they love money are lying
  ** Nothing in the world is as important as wealth
  ** Acquire riches, no matter who stands in your way
  ** Lies give the truth meaning
  ** Discover someone's deepest desire and you will find
     the key to his soul
~

0 'DISEASE' 'DISEASE RELIGION'~
The church of Morgion is composed of slaves. Morgion waits until disease
seizes hold of a person, then offers respite from the disease in exchange
for life-long servitude.  Those who accept find themselves "cured", only
to be sent forth to carry disease to others; thereby gaining Morgion
more followers.

Cultists of Morgion gather in small groups, usually no more than three,
whose task is to spread disease and suffering to everyone they encounter.
This task also includes the study and creation of various poisons,
especially those that mimic the effects of disease. These cultists may be
found anywhere - large cities, small villages, even the elven lands and
as far away as the minotaur isles - but must work in secret, for if they
were discovered their lives would be forfeit. Above all, they fear their
sworn enemies; the clerics of Mishakal.

Followers of Morgion may be of any ethos, but MUST be of evil alignment.
Those wishing to receive their god's blessing must serve their god in
some remarkable way including, but not limited to: infesting cities or
decimating a village through the spread of disease and plague, poisoning
key figures in such a manner as to indicate ill-health as the culprit,
and bringing more followers into the fold. Other tasks may be assigned
at the god's discretion.

The servants of Morgion live by a simple code:

  ** Disease breeds fear
  ** Fear is power
  ** Spread disease and reap the terrible reward
~

0 'DESTRUCTION' 'DESTRUCTION RELIGION'~
The majority of those who worship Sargonnas are minotaurs, who refer to
him as Sargas and worship him above all other gods. To them, Sargas
represents power gained by strength and held through honor. Minotaurs tend
to look down on any member of another race who claims to worship Sargonnas,
and often refuse to admit that this deity is the same god as Sargas.

Most of Sargonnas' non-minotaur worshippers view the deity as a god of
vengeance. His clerics are often sought out by individuals seeking to take
unlawful revenge on those who have wronged them. Bounty hunters and
mercenaries are among the most common of Sargonnas' followers. Despite
their general attitude that might makes right, and that mercy is a sign
of weakness, most followers of Sargonnas adhere to a warrior code of
honor that respects prowess in battle, even among enemies, and looks down
upon sneaky or underhanded tactics of any sort, believing that those who
are strong need no such methods.

Those who follow the tenets of Sargonnas are typically of Lawful ethos,
and Neutral or Evil alignment - though Neutral Evil worshippers are also
accepted. Those wishing to receive the blessings of their god must prove
their might through an increasing series of challenges, usually involving
trials by combat against a series of foes.

The warrior code adhered to by the followers of Sargonnas is as follows:

  ** Strength is power - the weak have no place in society
  ** Power is gained through strength and held through honor
  ** Be loyal to those who are loyal to you - destroy those who betray you
  ** Wreak vengeance on those who wrong you
  ** Never show mercy, for mercy dishonors both you and your enemy
~

0 'STORM' 'STORM RELIGION'~
The followers of Zeboim are mainly comprised of sailors, pirates and
evil druids, although many others worship her out of fearful respect,
or in an effort to please her mother, Queen Takhisis. Priests of Zeboim
are seen as welcome additions to the crew, leading the sailors in prayer
and making offerings to the Sea Queen.

Clerics of Zeboim tend to reflect the dual nature of their goddess and
are not above resorting to extortion, frightening ship owners and sailors
into paying tithes in exchange for good weather. While on land, priests of
Zeboim take a ritual swim each morning, regardless of weather conditions.
Every eight months, under the full moon of Solinari, a ceremony known as
the Sea Queen's Share is performed. During this ceremony, the priest
sacrifices most of their wealth to the goddess by sending it forth into
the ocean. If the goddess is pleased with the sacrifice, most of the items
will float back. If not, they are never seen again.

Followers of Zeboim tend to reflect the Chaotic nature of their goddess,
and are of Neutral or Evil alignment - though Neutral Evil followers are
not unheard of. Those wishing to receive special favor from the Sea Queen
must spend long voyages in meditation and prayer (along with a generous
sacrifice), if the goddess is pleased, she may assign the devotee a
particular task according to her whim.

Followers of Zeboim live by the following code:

  ** People respect and fear fury
  ** No sailor is safe unless the Sea Queen wills it - therefore, worship
     her and offer her many gifts
  ** In time, the sea will consume all, and all lands will drown under
     the power of Zeboim - adore her or be lost to the storm
~

0 'HATRED' 'HATRED RELIGION'~
Those who worship Takhisis serve as her eyes and ears upon Krynn and obey
her without hesitation, working tirelessly to open the doorway that will
admit her into the world in her full glory. The goddess urges her followers
to seek positions of power, no matter what the cost, and her clerics are
free to use any means necessary to achieve dominance, including lying,
extortion and murder. Those who worship the Dark Queen also fear her, for
she is swift to punish those who betray her, or refuse to obey her commands.

Clerics of Takhisis are found in all parts of the world, many of them
brazenly open about their faith, though most find that they must resort to
secrecy to achieve their goals. They pass their days plotting and
manipulating; working to destroy or sabotage the power of every other
deity of Krynn. Many of her Dark Majesty's clerics are non-humans. Ogres
are her most devoted followers, though draconians also revere her deeply.

Takhisis demands the strictest obedience from her subjects, and therefore,
her followers are universally of Lawful ethos and Evil alignment. Those
followers who wish to receive the Dark Queen's blessing must undertake a
special task for the goddess, designed to advance her ambitions and
strengthen her base of power, as well as weakening that of the other gods.

Worshippers of Takhisis are united by the following strictures:

  ** Those who serve Takhisis are destined to rule the world and bring
     order out of chaos
  ** Power must be attained at any cost
  ** Trust none except for those you control
{x  ** Do not let such things as love and compassion weaken you or blind
     you to what must be done
  ** Betrayal is punished by eternal torment - Service is rewarded
     with dominion

1 JOUST~
Syntax: joust <victim>
 
Using a Polearm or Spear, a person can thrust their weapon into their foe, dealing
a good amount of damage. One must be mounted and proficient in Mounted Combat, in
order to use this skill.
~

1 'AUTOYIELD'~
Syntax: Autoyield
 
With Autoyield enabled, people whom you are fighting with, may be able to yield
in combat. They will submit to you, dropping their weapon sometimes, and sitting
on the ground. They can ONLY submit to you, with this turned on.
 
SEE 'HELP YIELD' For details on how to Yield to someone automatically or manually
~

1 'YIELD'~
Syntax: Yield
{x      : Yield <#>
 
This command will allow you to SET your amount of Yield Points, or will allow you
to Yield immediately in combat. Simply typing YIELD, with no arguments, will
allow you to yield immediately in combat, provided your opponant, has Autoyield
turned on. If they do not, your request to yield in a fight, will be turned down.
If you type Yield, followed by a Number, this will represent how many Hit Points
you wish your character to Yield automatically at, when in a fight, and provided
again, your opponant has his or her autoyield turned on. You can NOT set this
value below 0 (Default number), nor can you set this value above one-third of your
total maximum hit points.
~

1 'AUTOMERCY' 'SUBDUE'~
Syntax: AUTOMERCY
 
With this Auto command turned on, it will mean that instead of outright killing
your opponant in combat, you will simply SUBDUE them. Naturally, you will not be
able to continue to attack once they are subdued. The fight is stopped right there,
leaving the victim sleeping forcefully for a brief moment, and also down to just
1 hit point. It will also render them quite hungry and thirsty. The good
thing about this, is that it will not kill the victim. However, if Automercy
is turned off, then you will end up killing them. Let it be known however,
if you have Automercy turned on, but your opponant does not, this does NOT mean
that YOU will be subdued. This only means that you will show mercy upon your
victim, by not killing them, but rather merely subdoing them.
 
Note: Anyone who is more than 10 levels above you, will automatically subdue you,
rather than kill you. They will not be able to kill you outright.
~

1 'ICEBLAST'~
Syntax: c 'iceblast'
 
This spell is an area affect spell, no target is required, as it will target
everyone in the room. This spell conjures a massive amount of ice, blasting
everyone with it, dealing a considerable amount of damage. Being an area
spell however, it will provoke everyone it hits, to jump in to attack you.
~

0 RESTRINGS~
The following restrictions are to be applied when doing restrings for
mortals.  If you see a restring that does not meet the following guidelines,
please let Majere or one of the Implementors know.  
 
GUIDELINES:
-----------
** DO NOT PUT "FAKE" TAGS IN RESTRINGS THAT COPY EXISTING FLAGS!
   This means things like Magic, Glowing, Invis, Humming, Crafted, Retooled,
{x   Masterworked, etc. Doesn't matter if you change the color or not. DON'T
{x   DO IT.
 
** No more than 2 Colors in short desc (3 if one is a "tag").
 
** NO color in long descs. Period.
 
** No more than 2 "tags" - period. A limit of one is preferred if the item
   already has one (i.e. glowing, humming)
 
** Solid colors please. Absolutely no goofy shit {Wl{Ri{Yk{Ge {Ct{Bh{Mi{Rs{W!{x
 
** Do not color the ENTIRE short desc. Leave out words like a, an, the, etc.
   Pick a couple of the MOST appropriate words.
 
** Use black sparingly. Some clients do not display black text properly
   and will look invisible, or simply list "a         ".  Make sure that
   at least one keyword remains visible.

** You are NOT ALLOWED to have half a word colored, or split colors. If
   colors are used, a whole word will be the same solid color.
 
** All Colors will be used SPARINGLY. Color will be at the discretion of
   the Immortals. If your Color is rejected or cleared out this is why.
 
** Remember that long descs are what is shown when the item is on the
   GROUND. Do NOT use this as an "extra" description; keep it simple. We
   don't need to see an entire paragraph whenever someone drops the thing.
 
** The words used to handle an object are NON NEGOTIATABLE when asking for
   a restring. An immortal will set those words based on the short and long
   descriptions of the restrung item.
 
**These guidelines subject to additions and/or changes at any time. Remember
to check this file for any new additions or changes before restringing**
~

103 'RSTRIP'~
Syntax: rstrip <character>

 This command will strip a player's religion, both removing them from
their religion altogether and also removing their mark.  Use this in case
someone needs to be free and clear of any religion.  This command will also
remove someone's DEVOTION status and mark as well.  
~

102 'EXLIST'~
Syntax: exlist
 
This command will display a list of rooms that are connected
to rooms that are in the area you are in.
 
For example: using this command in palanthas might give you something like this:
 
 3001 Entrance to the Temple of  <     2 Limbo                     (void    )
 3103 The Private Section    <> 2913 Along a Winding Passagehallknow)
 3164 On a wooden dock           <>10843 On a wooden dock          (nevermin)
 3261 Temple Row             <  9400 Before the grove          (shoikan )
 3256 Outside the Gates of Palan <>13701 High Knight's Road        (clerist )
 3260 Gates of Paladine          <> 2800 Zeboim's Deep         (zebdeep )
 3266 Nobles Way             <>13700 Inside the Solamnic Knight(clerist )
 3001 Entrance to the Temple of  <  3760 A Safe Room               (school  )
 3001 Entrance to the Temple of   > 3700 Great Doors of the Palanth(school  )
 3052 Outside the West Gate of P <>  927 Vingaard Road             (palroads)
 3053 Outside the East Gate of P <>  900 Along a dirt road         (palroads)
 
 
So, now what does this all mean? First, lets start with the first thing in the
list, which is a VNUM. That VNUM is the vnum of the room that is linked to a room
in a different area. The title following the VNUM, is the NAME of that room. The
next syntax after the name, are greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols. These
symbols represent which way the rooms are connected. But before we get into that,
we'll explain what comes after those symbols. The next thing is another VNUM. This
is the VNUM of the room which is in another area that is connected
to the room in palanthas (or the area your in) that preceeds it on the same line.
The next thing on each line, the name of an area in parenthesis, is the name of the
area in which the name of the room just prior to it, belongs to. Now that we know
what all the names are, we can discuss what those <> symbols represent.
Lets take the first one:
3001 Entrance to the Temple of  <     2 Limbo                     (void    )
 
This means that those 2 rooms are connected (VNUMS: 3001 and 2) However, they are
only connected via 1 direction. This means that if you are in room vnum 2, you can
enter the room 3001. However, you can not go the other way. Now, on the next line
you see:
3103 The Private Section    <> 2913 Along a Winding Passagehallknow)
This means that you can be in either room, and you can enter the other from one
another.
 
This is one of those "either you get it, or you don't and hence then should not use
it" commands. This command is used to help best determine which areas are linked
to what other areas, and through which rooms are they connected
by. It is used mostly for builders, and is also used when transporting over areas
from our Builder Port, in case ALL exits in a particular area,
need to be removed.
~

1 'IMMOLATION'~
Syntax: c 'immolation'
 
This spell will engulf the caster in magical flames, enhancing their abilities in
comabt, to better help them to hit their victims more often and with a little more
effect. This spell may also benefit them in protection from being hit as well.
~

1 'WRATH OF NATURE'~
Syntax: c 'wrath of nature' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to deliver a serious blow to his or her victim, through
the use of their magical ability to make their surroundings come alive.
 
Depending on the terrain they are in when casting this spell, each time they cast
this spell result in something different. For example, casting this spell while
in a Forest will actually make the forest spring alive for a brief moment, just
long enough to lash out at the caster's victim.
~

1 'PLANT GROWTH'~
Syntax: c 'plant growth'
 
This spell allows the caster to create plant life in their immediate surroundings,
where perhaps the lush life of plant growth is barren.
 
The magical plants created, will allow for the caster to use other skills or spells
that would normally require him or her to be in a forest, or other terrain similar
to a forest. The caster MUST be outdoors, and naturally, attempting to cast this
spell while already in a forest, will prove to be nothing but a waste of energy.
~

1 'PREACH'~
Syntax: preach
 
This skill will allow a Cleric who has been Marked by his or her God as a High
Priest or Priestess of that religion, the ability to preach to those around him/her.
Their preaching will affect anyone who is around them, so long as they aren't deaf.
This preaching will afflict one's personal feeling towards a path of enlightenment
(Alignment). So long as the person(s) who are listening do not already follow the
same path as the Cleric doing the preaching, OR are not too far gone down the path
of Darkness nor Light, everyone's path of enlightenment, will then change towards
the God of which the Cleric is devoted to.

A lot of commands for this special skill/command. First off, a foot note should be
inserted here, letting the Bard know that SONG and SONGS are two different commands.
Song will allow you to use this command. SONGS, will still display a list of songs
that the Bard can play, using a Musical instrument, using the PLAY skill. These 2
skills/commands should never get confused with being one and the same. They are
completely seperate and different.
 
SING <NUMBER> / STOP - This command will allows you to sing a song on your SONG
list (NOT SONGS LIST). The songs in this list are listed in numerical order. To
sing song number 4 for example, you'd type SING 4. While in the MIDDLE of singing
a song, you may choose to STOP singing for whatever reason. To do this, type
SING STOP. This will halt you from continuing with the song.
 
SONG LIST - this will display a list of songs that are available for you to
sing. This list will display the song NUMBER, which is to be used as your reference
when wanting to sing that particular song.
 
SONG TITLE <TEXT> - This will set the TITLE for a new song, which is one method to
also BEGIN writing a new song.
 
SONG READ <NUMBER> - This will read (display) the context of the song you specify.
 
SONG <+> <TEXT> - This will ADD new lines to the Song you are composing.
 
SONG CLEAR - This command will completely clear ALL text you have written for the
song you are currently editing.
 
SONG SHOW - This command will display what you have written thus far, providing
you are in the middle of editing a new song
 
SONG PRETTY - This command is VERY IMPORTANT. You MUST use this command upon
completion, BEFORE YOU COMPOSE it. If your song is *NOT* Pretty'd, the output
display people will see, may become distorted, as the code automatically displays
a certain amount of text per line, whether reading from a new line or not.
 
SONG DELETE <line number> - This will delete 1 particular line from the song you
are currently editing.
 
SONG INSERT <line number> <text> - This will insert text into
your song at the specified line number.
 
SONG COMPOSE - This will POST the song you are editing to your SONG list. This is
the final step to getting your new songs ready for use. Without using this command,
your song will NOT be posted.
 
SONG REMOVE <number> - This will remove a song from your list, specified by which
number the song is on your list that you input.
 
SONG EXPUNGE <number> This is for IMPLEMENTORS ONLY!! This will remove any song
from the list that you specify.
 
** If you are unsure about how to use these commands, sit back, take a deep breath,
relax, and try again but more slowly. Do NOT try rushing this command as if you
were a master at it, until you feel more comfortable. Like anything else, this
new skill/command works as described here in the HELP file, not how your twisted
mind may think it should work. ;)
 
 
*** Also, if you wish to have each sentence you sing on a new line, you
need only add in a PERIOD.  Regardless of how the SONG PRETTY command
actually formats your song, adding in a period will ensure that the next set
of words go onto a NEW line.

anyone or anything for a short period of time either.

their life forces more quickly.
~

1 'SONG OF THE ROSE'~
Syntax: play song of the rose
 
This song is one of pure enlightenment. It would be described by some as being more

~

1 'SONG OF THE KENDER'~
Syntax: play song of the kender
 
This is an inspirational and energizing song, one that any living creature who's

~

1 'MEDITATION'~

mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.

much trouble learning to meditate.

that their character should be allowed to live on beyond the normal time
they would normally have before age death.  This command is always
logged, so be careful as to whom you use it on.  Also, it should be noted
that if you use this command on someone who already has it on, and they've
already aged more since then, you could possibly through them into instant
age death, so use it wisely, and make note as to who you use it on.

1 INSPIRE 'COMPANY MIGHT' 'COMPANY HONOR' 'COMPANY VALOR'~
Syntax: inspire might
{x        inspire valor
{x        inspire honor
 
One of the most inspiring things a Knight can do, is to encourage those who
fight along side him.  A Knight may inspire allies to fight with MIGHT, VALOR,
and HONOR.  The Knight's allies becoming inspired by any or all of these moral
traits, will find himself being able to fight even better than before.
 
The three skills a Knight has, COMPANY MIGHT, COMPANY HONOR, and COMPANY VALOR,
MUST be used utilizing the syntax, INSPIRE, followed by the keyword that comes
after the word COMPANY, in order to work.    They can all three be used
at the same time, they are not restricted to only being able to have one of
the three affects.
~

1 'MARK'~
Syntax [Mortals Only]: mark <char>
{x     [Immortals Only]: mark <char> <religionname> [leader]or[high]or[devotee]
 
Those mortals who already have been marked by their respective Immortal, and
are marked as that Immortal's High Priest or Priestess, may spread their
Immortal's religious word and mark others who have devoted themselves to the
same Immortal as the Priest or Priestess has. They must be a devotee in order
for this to work.  Those who are not already a devotee of the Immortal the
Priest or Priestess represents, can not recieve the mark of that Immortal by
said Priest or Priestess.  As well, a High Priest or Priestess, may not
mark those ourside of his/her religion, nor mark those devoted to other
religions.
 
 
Immortals may mark those mortals who have kneeled down and devoted themselves
to them.  Immortals may only mark those who are devoted to him or her, and may
not mark those who are devoted to a different Immortal, or no Immortal at all.
Likewise, for those who are worthy of recieving such a mark, only Clerics can
recieve the High Priest(ess) Mark.  Any of them can recieve the Leader mark,
but should be reserved for a select few, or only one, who has proved to be
the most devout.
~

1 'SONG OF NIGHTMARES'~
Syntax:  play song of nightmares
 
This song can be a very affective countermeasure in a Bard's arsenol of
defense.  While in a fight, a Bard who plays this song will penetrate his or
her victim's mind and instill a very powerful nightmare, powerful enough
to make the victim flee from the battle in a terrified panic.
~

1 'SONG OF COMPASSION'~
Syntax: play song of compassion
 
This song will protect a Bard and his or her companions from those who are
aligned with the forces of Evil as well as the forces of Good.  It will not
protect against those who remain neutral however.
~

1 'SONG OF SOULS'~
Syntax: play song of souls
 
This song, when played by an experienced Bard, will fill all its listeners
with spiritual sanctity that will alleviate the affects of poison and plague.
The song will also heal those who are in need of healing.  Of course, this
will only affect the Bard and his or her companions.
~

1 'SONG OF IDIOCY'~
Syntax: play song of idiocy
 
This song can be very useful to a Bard in battle.  A victim who hears this
song being played, will be overcome with mind shattering sounds, which in
turn, subsequently lowers the victim's defenses, making them more vulnerable
to attacks, both physical and magical.
~

1 'CLEAR THOUGHTS'~
Syntax: c 'clear thoughts'
 
This spell will allow the caster to become resistant, up to eighty percent,
against mind shattering spell affects.
~

1 'FLYING SWORDS' 'FLYINGSWORDS'~
Syntax: c 'flyingswords' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to conjure forth scimitar looking swords that
hover in the air around the caster.  The swords will immediately attack the
victim in which the caster has identified as the target.  Once the swords
have struck their target, they will then dissipate back into the void from
where they came.
~

1 'BATTLESTAFF'~
Syntax: c 'battlestaff'
 
This spell will create a battlestaff weapon for the caster to wield.  While
the weapon is deemed to be weak in actual fighting by most, the staff is
still very useful as it contains magical abilities that are automatically
generated by the staff while in a fight.  These magic abilities are typically
more defensive than offensive, but they offer the caster a better chance at
getting out of a fight alive, rather than dead.  And while the staff does not
do a significant amount of physical damage, it still proves to be a useful
weapon when the caster is otherwise without.
~

1 'QUICKSAND'~
Syntax: c 'quicksand' <target>
 
This spell will shift the earth below the victim's feet, turning the ground
into quicksand.  The victim will purge in up to his or her waist before finally
coming to a stop.  This in effect will slow a victim's movement down, and will
make it extremely difficult for them to move away from the immediate area.
The only condition for the caster is that he or she can ONLY use this spell
when in a desert.
~

1 'TREEFORM'~
Syntax:  Treeform
 
This skill allows a Druid to morph into the form of a tree.  This will in turn,
give the Druid greater strength and a greater defense.  All who approach the
morphed Druid will merely see a tree.  However, the Druid can only use this
skill while in a region of land where forests would typically be seen growing.
If not, the skill will not work.  If the druid is morphed and THEN decides to
move into a non-forest like region, the affect will wear off and they will
return to their normal form.
~

1 'FEEBLEMIND'~
Syntax: c 'feeblemind' <victim>
 
This spell will alter a victim's mental focus in the forum of lowering both
their intelligence and their overall mental energy.  This is a spell
that is most effective against those professions that rely upon these two
attributes as their primary source of power.
~

1 'WINDTALK'~
Syntax: windtalk <victim> <message>
 
This skill allows a druid to deliver a messsage via the wind, to anyone in
the world.  This skill will require the druid to have harnessed at least a
little mental energy to successfully conjure a gust of wind capable of
carrying a message to its intended recipient.
~

102 BACKCHECK~
Syntax: BACKCHECK <player>
 
This command will allow you to check the background of any character in the
MUD.  This is a helpful tool to see who is spending the extra time in
developing a strong, thought out character; to see who is going above and
beyond just adding in character description.
~

1 CONCLAVE TEST~
The Test of High Sorcery was created by the first three mages, Corenthas,
Eriane, and Shaud, in order to make sure that those who did not have
self-control did not have access to High Sorcery.  Those who wish to take
the Test must first be apprenticed to one who is already a Wizard of High
Sorcery.  The Test weeds out those which would use it for simple purposes,
like entertainment, from those that wish to study magic seriously.
 
Once the apprentice is invited to take the Test, he or she must travel to
the Tower of Wayreth; the apprentice is permitted to bring a single
companion with them.  No two Tests are ever alike, and mages are prohibited
from talking about what transpires during their Test.
 
Three tests are given in order to test an apprentice.s knowledge of magic,
which usually consists of casting every spell at their disposal successfully.
Three more tests are given to see how the apprentice reacts to situations
that cannot be solved by magic alone. A single test will involve someone or
something they love, and lastly they will be pitted against an adversary much
more powerful than themselves, or be forced to face their greatest fears.
There are no breaks between each task, and all together they makeup the Test
of High Sorcery.
{x
Most apprentices that take the Test, and pass, are either permanently altered
either mentally or physically; none pass through the Test unscathed. Failure
to pass the Test almost assuredly means death.
{x
The apprentice wears a color of robe he or she thinks is suitable during his
or her Test. However, the applicant.s decisions during the Test will determine
the final color of robes which they will wear if they pass the Test, and
therefore decide the Order of High Sorcery and God or Goddess they will serve.
{x
{RDisclaimer - By taking the Test of High Sorcery agree with the following:{x
{x
{y1){x That your Test taking may be postponed, and pre-Testing tasks may be
assigned until the Conclave deems you ready to be Tested. The Test of High
Sorcery is the most important event in a mage.s life and usually determines
their fate. Don.t think of it as something to rush through, think of it as
something to build up to.
{x
{y2){x That this is an intense ICA = ICC (in-character actions = in-character
consequences) event; meaning that your actions will determine the Test.s
outcome.
{x
{y3){x That the majority of the Test will be roleplayed; LoK is a roleplay enforced
MUD. You can be level 900 and that doesn.t guarantee you.ll pass the Test.
{x
{y4){x That the Test will often times change a character permanently either
mentally or physically (i.e. reoccurring nightmares, physical disfiguration
or loss of limb, markings like scars, etc) and you are willing to incorporate
these into your characters RP should they occur.
{x
{y5){x That failure means {Rdeath{x; if your character dies and thus fails the Test,
you agree to have the appropriate Staff member change your name. This allows
your character to die (ICA = ICC) but saves you the grief of having to recreate
and lose all the levels you worked so hard to gain.
~

1 WILDERNESS LORE~
Syntax: wilderness
 
This skill allows a Druid to determine which type of herbs he or she may be
able to find in the current area they are in.  This helps eliminate any guess
work that would otherwise be required to know in order to find the desired
herbs.
~

0 ~
~

102 SALIGN~
Syntax: salign <character> <alignment value: -1000 to 1000>
 
This command allows you to change the alignment of your target to the desired
setting.  The same can be done using the SET command, but this will allow you
to change the alignment of an individual a little quicker since it uses less
arguments to execute.  Also, because the SET command is level 109, this will
allow Immortals of lower levels the ability to change alignments without
having to ask someone higher up to do so.
~

102 FSLAY~
Syntax: fslay <target player> <type>
Types:  Skin, Slit, Immolate, Demon, Shatter, 9mm, Deheart, Pounce, Fslay
 
This Immortal command allows you to do a partial slay on a player of a lesser
level.  Instead of outright killing the player, it will knock their hit points
down to 20, but their mana and movement points remain the same.  Fslay will
also move them to their hometown room and will put them in the resting position.
~

102 NOPK~
Syntax: nopk <victim>
 
This command will prevent players from being able to attack other players.
While this command will prevent the player from initiating combat with
another player, it will not prevent players from attacking them.  This means
that they could still PK another player if the other person attacks first.
If and when this happens, it should not be a mark against the player who has
this flag set, since they did not initiate combat and this flag is typically
used for problem players as a penalty to begin with.
 
If you see a player still able to get around this flag by exploiting something
in the game, please send a note to Immortal with details as to how they got
around the penalty.
~

102 ROOMCHECK~
Syntax: roomcheck <command>
{x
Command | Result
_______________________________________
names   - Check rooms for lack of names.
white   - Check Room names for white.
link    - Check Room's for links.
private - Check Room for Private w/o SAFE.
descr   - Check Room for BLANK descriptions.
delete  - Check DELETED status on rooms.
 
~

102 USERS~
Syntax: users
 
This command will give you a quick informational display about users who are
currently logged into the MUD. You will see their name, class, level, total
hours they've played throughout the history of their character, their incognito
and wizinvis level (applicable only to Immortals), what room they are currently
in, their alignment, and religion if applicable.
~

102 RPDUMP~
Syntax: rpdump <vnum of Rprog>
 
This command works identical to the MPDUMP command, except for this command,
a person will need to enter a virtual number being used for a room program,
instead of a mob program.
~

102 OPDUMP~
Syntax: opdump <vnum of Oprog>
 
This command works identical to the MPDUMP command, except for this command,
a person will need to enter a virtual number being used for an Object program,
rather than a mob program.
~

102 EXTRABIT~
Syntax: extrabit <item name> <flags>
{x
This command will add flags to the EXTRA field on an object.  It must be
noted however that as soon as you enter an argument from the list below,
it will automatically remove any and all flags the object currently has.
So if an object has Hum, Evil, and Dark on it already and you want to add
the Bless flag to it in addition to the three it already has, then you must
re-enter the flags for the other three values as well.  So you would enter:
extrabit <object name> BECI 
{x
This would re-add the flags that the object already had before, as well as
the new flag(s) you're trying to add in addition to it.  It is also recommended
that you are holding the object you are trying to modify the flags on so that
you do not accidentally modify the wrong object.
{x
{x
Flag Listings:
{x
A - Glow           B - Hum           C - Dark
D - Masterwork     E - Evil          F - Invis
G - Magic          H - No Drop       I - Bless
J - Anti Good      K - Anti Evil     L - Anti Neutral
M - No Remove      N - Inventory     O - No Purge
P - Rot Death      Q - Vis Death     S - Non Metal
T - No Locate      U - Melt Drop     V - Had Timer
W - Sell Extract   X - Stainless     Y - Burn Proof
Z - No Uncurse
{x
To remove all flags type 'extrabit <target object> 0'
~

102 QUESTRESET~
Syntax: questreset <player>

This command will re-set the quest timer and other quest flags on a
player.  Each time a player requests a quest, they are given a timer before
they are allowed to ask for another one.  By using this command, it will
re-set everything, allowing the player to ask for another quest immediately.
~

1 BEASTSPITE~
Syntax: beastspite <victim> <option: bear|lizard|fox|wolf|wyvern|dragon|bat>
 
This skill is more of a spell by nature that places a curse on your victim,
making them vulnerable to aggressive attacks whenever they come in contact
with a mobile of the respective race you cursed them with.  For example, if you
beastspite someone with dragon, every time they run into a room with a dragon,
they will be attacked by said dragon.  The aggro attacks will last for the
duration of the curse.
 
(NOTE: Only works on Players)
~

102 'DIG' 'EXIT'~
For exits, type the direction (north/s/e/w) followed by:
 
dig <vnum>         - creates the room and makes a two way link
link <room vnum>   - make a two way link
room <room vnum>   - make a one way link (use with caution)
key <object vnum>  - makes specified object the vnum of the key required
name <door name>   - makes the door's name/keywords = to the given name
desc               - edit the description of the exit
delete             - delete this exit
<exit-flags>       - type ? EXIT for a list(make exit door, locked etc.)
 
The exit flags are presented in the following manner.  The capitalized
flags are ones not included in the reset info.  i.e. closed is due to
a player closing the door and not due to the door being set to be closed.
 
-South to [ 3744] Key: [   -1] Exit flags: [door CLOSED bashed pickproof]
~

102 hedit~
This command is specifically for immortals with security 9 to allow the
creation or modification of help files.
 
The following commands are used to edit and create help entries
 
{yhedit <command>{x - where command is the name of the help file you wish to edit
{ytext{x            - will put you in the editor
{ynew <command>{x   - will create a new help entry with the keyword command
{ydone{x            - will exit the heditor
{ydelete{           - deletes the currently viewed help file
{ynivel <level>{x   - will restrict access to the help file to a certain level range.
 
{BPlease note, hedit is very unstable. So please use {yasave changed{B before
using it{x
~

102 'RENAME'~
RENAME <character you wish to change> <new name>
 
This command is only available at level 109 and 110. It is used to change
the persons character name. It is an effective command to use for players
who have no knowledge of creating an acceptable roleplaying name and for
people who purposely create characters with unacceptable names, such as 
"Porky" "Ice-T" and so on and so forth.
~

102 TRANSIN~
This neat little command is mostly used in part for a better roleplaying
environment. Type the word TRANSIN followed by a text sentence. When you
transfer someone into the same room as you or to anywhere you wish to,
everyone will see a message appear, almost like a sort of EMOTE. To
everyone in the same room as the person, they will see, for example:
{x
Schmuck has been summoned by a greater force!
{x
Your TRANSIN in this case, would be 'has been summoned by a greater force'
Schmuck is the name of the character of which you transferred, there is no
need to add this into your TRANSIN, for the code automatically does that.
Everyone's default transin is <name> arrives in a mushroom cloud. You may
leave it or change it to your liking. In the example above, you'd simply
type TRANSIN has been summoned by a greater force. Fairly simple to use.
~

102 TRANSOUT~
Syntax: TRANSOUT <text>
 
Identical to TRANSIN, this will display a text to everyone in the room
when someone is transfered out. You may put in whatever suites your needs,
however, you must put in a verb as the first word of the text, a verb
which depicts a person leaving. Examples would be:
 
Disappears / sent back
 
Those are just two of many you could come up with. For a better
understanding, also see 'HELP TRANSIN'.
~

102 ORESET~
Syntax: ORESET <vnum> <args>
{x        -no_args               = into room
{x        -<obj_name>            = into obj
{x        -<mob_name> <wear_loc> = into mob  
 
This command MUST be used from inside REDIT. Once in REDIT and an object
has been created, you may then choose to load it into the resets for
the room you want it in or mob you want it on by using ORESET.
You must follow the ORESET with the VNUM of the object you wish to add.
Anything you add to a room's resets will continue to repop, given that
it has been removed from the room, so, if you use the ORESET command to
load an object for yourself, make sure to delete the reset immediately.
 
Type 'HELP RESET' for more information on using resets.
~

102 'ROOM FLAGS'~
Syntax: ROOM <flag>
{x 
DARK         - This flag will make it so the character is required to
{x               have a light source to see anything inside the room.
NO_MOB       - This sets the room as PC-only. No Mob will be allowed in
               the room (very good for an entry to an area, that way your
               mobs don't wander into other areas)
{x
INDOORS      - This will set the room as 'indoors' .. usually used with
               the "inside" sector flag. 
{x
PRIVATE      - This will make the room a 'private' room. Only two players
              (or mobs) can be inside the room at a time. 
{x
SAFE         - This flag will make it impossible to start a fight in the
               room. 
{x 
SOLITARY     - Much like the 'private' flag - however only ONE player
              (or mob) can be inside the room at a time. 
{x 
PET_SHOP     - Necessary for the actual shop part of the petshop (where the
               shopkeeper is) 
{x
NO_RECALL    - Makes the room impossible to recall from
{x
IMP_ONLY     - Makes room available only to imp level characters (unless
               transferred in). 
{x
GODS_ONLY    - Makes room available only to immortals (unless transferred
               in). 
{x
HEROS_ONLY   - Only available to hero level and immortals
{x
NEWBIES_ONLY - Only available to newbies (usually levels 1-5) and immortals
{x
LAW          - The "law" flag makes it so that all Player Killer/Thief flags
               will be effective in this room (i.e. cityguards, etc. will
               attack) 
{x
NOWHERE      - This flag makes it so if the character uses the "where"
               command in the room, it will tell them no one else is in the
               area (even if there are 20 people there)
{x
LIGHT        - Prevents the room from going dark or requiring a player to
               have a light source.
~

102 ASAVE~
Syntax:
{x  asave <vnum>   - saves a particular area
{x  asave list     - saves the area.lst file
{x  asave area     - saves the area being edited
{x  asave changed  - saves all changed zones
{x  asave world    - saves the world! (db dump)   
~

102 ZECHO~
Syntax: ZECHO <message>
{x
Similar to the other echo commands, use this to send a message to all 
players in the same zone as you are. Any higher-level god will see a
prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it is a 
ZECHO.
~

0 'GASEOUS FORM'~
Syntax: c 'gaseous form'
 
This spell will surround the caster in a cloud of gas that provides a form
of protection as well as a boost to their hit roll.
 
The level of protection and hit roll amount increase with level.
~

0 'BLESSED WATCHFULNESS'~
Syntax: c 'blessed watchfulness'
{x        c 'blessed watchfulness' <target in your group>
 
When cast, this spell will bring the caster or anyone in their group, to a
sense of heightened alertness.  While in this heightened state, they essentially
become immune to being blackjacked by a sneaking thief.  However, once an
attempt has been made, the affect will immediately wear off.  While in this
state, the person affected will also see an increase in wisdom as well.
~

0 'ARROW DEFLECTION'~
While holding a shield, this passive skill will cut the chances of being
struck by an arrow to half of the percentage in which the skill is learned. 
Once the skill has been learned up to 100%, then your chances of being
struck by an arrow are immediately reduced by an overall 50%; only negated
slightly if the person firing the arrow is firing from point blank range.  
 
~

0 'BLACK CAIRN'~
Syntax: c 'black cairn'
 
This spell will reveal the location of corpses located throughout the world,
giving the caster a faster way to find dead bodies they can use to animate
to do their evil bidding.
~

0 'BLESSED WARMTH'~
Syntax: c 'blessed warmth'
{x        c 'blessed warmth' <character>
 
This spell can only be cast upon the caster or their fellow group members.
Once cast, the affects of this spell will render the target complete immune
to any type of cold attacks, whether through magic or conventional means.
~

0 'RELEGATE'~
Syntax: relegate <character>
 
While in a religious temple, this skill will allow a Cleric to open a small
dimentional rift to push their victim through in order to expel them from
the temple.  This helps Clerics to get rid of unwelcomed guests, especially
those whom they feel are disgracing the temple.  However, Clerics may not use
this on other Clerics, regardless of religion difference.  Likewise, Clerics
may use this skill in any temple, even if they do not worship the respective
Immortal for which the temple they are in, has been built to honor, so long
as the Cleric attempting to relegate someone, has been marked by their 
respective Immortal of worship.
~

102 'AUTODIG'~
Syntax: Autodig
{x
Autodig is a command that can be toggled on and off. When this command is
active and the person is in REDIT, a builder can enter in any direction
(N, S, E, W, U, D) and autodig will do several things automatically: it
will generate a new room in that direction; it will create a two-way link
between the existing room and the new room; it will move the builder into
the new room; and the new room will have the very next available VNUM
numerically.
{x
Example: you are editing room 5200. By turning autodig on and entering
"North", room 5201 will be created automatically, and you will be moved
there. There will be a single exit in room 5201, and it will lead South,
to room 5200.
{x
Now, continuing to use the above example, say you want to move to the South,
to get back to room 5200.  You will need to ensure that you've exited out of
autodig FIRST! By typing South with autodig active, simply moving to the
room is not what will happen. Instead, autodig will create another room to
the south of 5201 that has the VNUM 5202. You will then have a case of two
rooms overlapping, and while this will not crash the game, it will make your
area messy and unplayable. Because of this, not being mindful of when autodig
is active or inactive can lead to a long span of time disconnecting and
reconnecting rooms in the right order.
