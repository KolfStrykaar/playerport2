Baaz are the smallest and most common of the Draconian race.  Born of
corrupted Brass Dragon eggs they were the first to be brought to life
through the dark magicks that twisted the good Dragon eggs.  Baaz have
scales that range in color from tinges of bronze to dark green, and have
blood red eyes which look down a dog-like snout.  Their shoulders are
stooped and have small wings protruding from the backs of them.  Unlike
their brethren they like the dress of the Dragon Armies, they also have been
known to be able to disguise themselves as humans with masks and bulky
clothing

khisanth black dragon~
Khisanth the Black Dragon~
Khisanth the Great Black Dragon, lies here waiting to slaughter all whom disturb her.
~
Towering before you stands the Great Black Dragon, Khisanth.  From head
to tail, she's about thirty feet in length.  Razor claws and sharp pointy
teeth, instill great fear into your body and soul.  Obsidian scales, darker
than the sky at night itself, cover her entire body.  These scales are as
large shields in some areas.  Thick horns, at least two feet long, protrude
from the top of her skull.  Slanted yellow eyes roll side to side, scanning
the entire area.

Moderately rough looking, the Captain of the ship stands here.
~
This old human has a rough appearance.  His beard is white and moderately
filthy.  He wears an eyepatch over his left eye, his right eye heavily
bloodshot.  His only purpose here is to take passengers safely across the
New Sea between Solamnia and Abanasinia.  He doesn't appear to be very
friendly, perhaps it would be best not to talk to him and just keep to
yourself.

Southern Portcullis~
You are now standing before the massive portcullis of the southern gate. 
It is about fifty feet wide and one-hundred feet high.  The steel gate is
barbed at the end and could cause a lot of damage if dropped.  There are
guards up on the battlements watching every step you take.  Through the
portcullis, a long street stretches before you.  It passes through the
residential area of the city before branching into other parts of town.

Before you looms the southern gate of Xak Tsaroth.  The gate consists of
a huge fifty foot wide portcullis, framed by massive stones.  The portcullis
looks to be made of steel, and seems able to withstand everything, except
dragons.  High above the portcullis, guards on the battlements act as
sentries, looking for trouble before it arrives.  North of the gate is the
city.

the arms of a small mountain range to the north.  One thing can clearly be

As you leave the hustle and bustle of the market behind, the serene
sounds of a temple life can be observed.  The gentle chirping of birds and
the soft chanting of priests can be heard from the all around.  To the west
lies the market district and to the east, lies the great Temple of Mishakal.
To the south, a large stronghold, made of polished obsidian, stands tall. 
Draconians clad in the armor worn by Knights of Takhisis, patrol the walls,
armed to the teeth and ready for war.

barbed at the end and could cause a lot of damage if dropped.  There are
guards up on the battlements watching every step you take.  Through the
portcullis, a long street stretches before you.  It passes through a
somewhat rougher area of the city, as the gym and a tavern make their homes
on this road.  Farther down the street, it branches towards to the arena and
to the Temple of Mishakal.

a huge fifty foot wide portcullis, framed by massive stones.  The portcullis
looks to be made of steel, and seems able to withstand even the strongest
armies.  High above the portcullis, guards on the battlements act as
sentries, looking for trouble before it arrives.  East of the gate is the

up in the arms of a small mountain range, continuing on to the east.  One

shadowy, preventing one from being completely sure of what they see here. 
There is a single candle sitting in a sconce on the wall.  One would be wise
to be very careful around here.  The way back to the streets is up.

{DInside the Assassins Guild{X~
This room is very shadowy, a benefit for the Assassins Guild.  The walls
are covered with various assassination targets as well as different tools of
the assassin's trade.  Everyone in this room is speaking in hushed tones,
and its hard to make out anyones face.  The practice yard is to the west.

The assassin guildmaster stands here, watching over his apprentices.  All
of the apprentices are practicing various skills.  Some are backstabing a
dummy, and some are practicing their hiding ability.  The room has soft mats

on the ladder, the light begins to creep in the well from above.  It appears
as if the exit of this stairwell takes you into the fresh air and sunlight.

in the middle of the room.  The fruits on the table look enticing, but the
cleric at the table is going to eat them all before you can even get to any
of them.  There is also a bookcase, with all manner of herbal, healing, and
holy books on it.  South of here is the Meditation Chamber.

At the Altar of Mishakal~
Here you find yourself standing in the center of the temple.  A
sacrificial altar awaits any and all sacrifices to be made to Mishakal,
goddess of healing.  The altar is made of marble, with a light bluish tint
to it.  Chanting and singing can be heard coming from all around this vast
chamber.  The source of the singing can not be seen, but without a doubt, it
could only be coming from acolytes of Mishakal.  Located directly in the
center of the room lies a metal stand holding a large bowl of water.  Around
the base of the bowl, words have been etched into it.

water~
Before you is a large bowl, crafted from white stone, which is filled to
the brim with cool, blue water.  The water appears to be giving off a sort
of turqoise glow.  Around the base of the bowl, words have been elegantly
etched into it.  They appear to be written in the common tongue.  The words
read - 
{x
'For those seeking my blessing, call me out for my divine favor and I shall grant
{x you my warm blessing. The words you must speak aloud are:'
{x
Blessed Lady of the Heart, have mercy upon my soul and cast my body into the heavens!

Singing Sword~
As you look around the room, all manner of weapons can be seen hanging on
the walls.  Whether sword or mace, dagger or hammer, all can be bought from
the elven weaponsmith, Altus Oakleaf.  If you look at the weapons, you can
tell that these were made from the finest steel with the greatest attention
to detail.

Entrance to Arena Square~
Here is the entrance to Arena Square.  The entrance is a small footbridge
that crosses a peaceful pond.  In contrast to the serenity of the pond, many
sounds can be heard coming from the square, and the arena ahead.  The sound
of steel clashing against steel rings in the air.
