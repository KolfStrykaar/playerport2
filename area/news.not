Subject Cleaning Tower!~
Text
There I was, cleaning these big towers! One of the worst things to do!
I was In the middle of cleaning on my first day and I already ran into a problem!
I had to keep going down to the fountain to get water, and I don't know any spells that would clean things!
I was thinking about getting a blacksmith or a illusionist to help me, but I had no money!
These walls I had to clean were just dirty beyond, um, ya! I was thinking about just destroying the tower and rebuilding it hehe!
Well, after my first day, I went down and made that cleric mad! He started yelling at me, all because I wanted to be healed for free! I told him he wasn't going to get any service! He was wanting 25 steel just so I could be healed! What a cheap skate!
Well, I was sleeping then this idea came to me! I could probly transport a lake or portion of the ocean onto the towers and clean the whole place out! That was a good idea untill i found out that I am not good at teleporting, and I still don't know where the water went!
Well, I thought of how I could clean this big place! Well, I thought, and thought, and thought! Well, I came up with this!
'I could go make some money! pay a bard or ranger to get all the animals to help me! Not like that snow white crap! I mean like rats and stuff! I mean if they make the mess, why can't they pick it up! It cost me 1000 steel! That person was expensive!
I got the tower clean and that was what counts!

Diana: An Ancient Ritual
Sat Mar 20 03:21:56 2004
To: kot undead immortal
A lone figure, weak and thin, walked through the forest. All around her, animals were quiet, the trees themselves seemed to cower from the intruder. It was not the power they feared, it was the intent. Animals can sense something when it is about to happen, like the swine before the Cataclysm.
The figure walked into a glade. The glade was barren, empty, no sound or animal, no breeze or smell, save for one thing. In the center was a corpse, head thrown back in agony. In its ribcage was.. something. It was a sphere. It was not black or dark, it was simply... nothing.
The figure walked forward and pulled off its hood, revealing  pale white skin and colorless hair. The whole figure was devoid of color, save for two brilliant blue eyes, which slowly worked their way over the skeleton before them.
"{DHello Diana. It is a pleasure to look upon your body once more.. what is this? Did you fear I would not keep my promise? That I would not hold to a pact I made at your birth?{x"
Diana raised her head slightly. The voice came from within her, and she knew it, she had heard it before, she had heard it everyday since the day she was born. "{bYes... I was worried. But now I am not, I fear nothing..{x"
"{DExcellent, I see that we were not wrong in choosing each other. Need I even tell you what to do? I know you have known the deeds you will do today whilst still in your mothers womb.{x"
Diana cringed slightly at those words. "{bDo not mock me.. I was not born of a woman... my mother... was not a woman.{x"
"{DHow true, how true... you are right... do you know what you see before you? Or can you hear my voice before I even speak it, like your mother could?{x"
Diana knew. "{bI will do it... I will see you soon.{x" Diana pulled off her tattered robes and stood naked in the center of the grove. She looked down and, though it had not been there a second before, saw a simple rusted dagger in the corpses hand. Diana took that and held it in her right hand, sweat pouring from her whole body.
She let out one last breath, and put the point of the dagger to her sternum. Slowly, the point bit deep, spilling {Rblood{x on the ground at her feet. She slowly brought the knife down her torso, stopping just below her navel.
Diana did not gasp in pain, no... in fact, with each inch of skin that was ripped asunder, her face grew more and more calm. When she was done with the dagger, she dropped it, watching it slowly slide out of her flesh and land in the pool of blood at her feet.
Diana began speaking. It was no language any on krynn had heard. It was a half gurgle, half pant... no, it was nothing but the language of magic, warped by the damaged lungs and heart.
Finally, the grove returned to silence. There was a flash of... darkness, and Diana had thought the ritual over. But when her vision returned, she looked down at the corpse of her mother. The sphere had lifted off the ground, and now floated slowly along the spinal column, through the pelvis and up to Diana.
Diana looked at it, and it seemed to look back at her, and then, as if they had both reached an agreement, it lept into the open wound in her chest. Diana, her strength returning despite her loss of blood, reached into the hole and grabbed something. Out came a heart, no longer beating, yet she felt a pulse. The orb within her beat as her heart had beaten earlier. She dropped her heart on the ground and closed her eyes in ecstacy as the wound closed up, leaving no trace of previous events.
"{D*laugh* Yes Diana, our dreams are come true... yours which you have had for less then half a century, mine which I have had since before Paladine created the elves.{x" This time, the voice did not come from her head.. it came from her chest.
"{bYes, let your will be done first, and then mine.{x"
Diana took a deep breath, her first since the ritual began. She picked up her robes and slid back into them, then walked quickly and forcefully out of the glade...

I was on my way home after the long journey from Neraka to Palanthas. To say the least I was in good sprits, but would not be for long I was soon to discover. It had not taken long for me to get back home from Planthas, because I had used the ways a magic to get there and back. I stood at my front door in that small alley in a matter of seconds. I dont know why but I paused before I entered, it was just for that split second, but some how deep inside I knew that it might bee my last moment of sanity.
 
 
  I entered the small house and to my suprise my father was sitting by himself, in our little living room. He was doing one thing I had never seen him do, he was crying. 'Where is mother' I asked him in a worried tone. 'S..she is i..in her be...bed' He had said between sobs. 'Pl...please do not go to h...her she i...is sleeping her enter...enternal rest.'
 
 
  For the first time in my life I had been scared. I may be a dark person, but my parents were everything to me so when I heard my father speek these word I had broke. I ran to her, she lie motionless in her bed. I began to shake her vielently, 'wake up, wake up mother' I cried but she would not move. I fell to the floor in pain, the pain of loss.
 
 
  My father eventuly came to the room. He walked to me, I lie broken on the floor. He lifted me of the floor into his arms and carried me off to my room. On the way there I looked into his eyes, they we the blackest of pits. He layed me on my bed and turned to leave before he shut the door he turned and said 'Good bye son, sleep well and know that your mother and I will always be with you', he left me to cry.
 
 
  I eventuly fell victem to sleep to wake in the morning to a slient house. I stood up and ran to their room. All was the same as the day before. My mother lay on her side of the bed dead. One thing had changed though, now my father lay next to her a dagger sticking out of his heart. My mind shattered, at any point it would break. I slumped to the floor and lay there for a long time.

After laying down, preparing for your sleep for the night, and falling
deep into a slumber, your mind goes at peace, and thoughts begin to gather
into a vision; at first, it was merely as though someone turned over a vial
filled with multiple colors of ink.  The scene swirls, slowly coming to the
form of a library, filled with bookshelves of mahagony stacked with a variety
of many books.  At the bottem of one of these bookshelves, far off in a courner
of the library, was a round, wooden table with one solitary chair and a single
candle lit at the center of it.  A man occupied the chair, dawned in the
red robes of a Conclavian, with long black hair and two black angels wings
sprouting from his back.  He was flipping through the pages of a book open
before him, leaning his head against his hand, which was proped up on the
table.  A dull emptiness filled his eyes, as he recited the names of many
spells to himself ("Acid blast...word of death...storm of vengeance...ect..)
Almost to the end of the book, a folded up loose sheet of paper falls to the
ground.  The person scoots his chair back and leans over to pick up the paper.
He examines it; it seems to be very old, yellow with years, but none of the
sterotypical cracks and crincles, as though it had been safeguarded from
most of time.  He unfolded the piece of paper, and began to dully read the
spidery contents.  His eyes stop at a spot, and he peers intently at it.  He
stands up and reachs for the center of the table, bringing the candle over
to him.  He then sits back down again, and re-reads what he had seen, and even
re-reads it a third time aloud, just to make sure he had the details right.
 
"...This spell, which mimics the death and rebirth of a Phoenix, is one of
the oldest og magics, used by desperate Magi.  Its prerequisits are out of
the norm; it may be difficult for some, yet easy for others.  This spell
requires a lightfollower, female in nature.  Without physical or magical force
must the lightfollower strip her clothing, as part of her particiaption in
the spell.  Then, by reciting the words below, and with the simple means of
a touch to the lightfollower's bare stomach, the caster may incase a rebirth
of himself within the lightfollower.  More times then not, the caster meets
his or her death immediatly afterwords, though there are cases of more power-
ful Magi escaping the bad fortures of the spell.  Reguardless of escape or not,
the caster immediatly dies upon the birth of his or her rebirthed form.  When
reborn, it is often that the caster may come to look somewhat as the light-
follower that he or she incased themselves into.  The gestation period is
often known to proceed three fold faster then normal, and the effects of the
conception are astounding; even after the lightbringer's death, the rebirth
would still proceed.  The caster has been known to be reborn even if the host's
body were burned to ashes.  The very powers of this spell draw energies not
unlike a Phoenix's, so to some scholars, it is not surprising that this is
so.  Many even go so far as to call this spell, "A second chance to life..."
 
The man reads this passage over and over again.  Each time he does, his eyes
glow brighter, as if though hopeful of something.  His face then goes pale, as
if though his stomach was doing somersaults, and he folds the paper back up
and stuffs it back into the book.  He moves to the bookshelf and stuffs the
book back in its place.  He blows the candle out, pushes in the chair, and
begins to make his way out of the library.  However, he stops at the door,
his hand keeping hold of the handle.  The soft pitter-patter of rain can be
heard on the windows, and extremely dim bits of sunlight escape into the
library, giving an eerie setting to it all.  The man turns his gaze back to
the table, with its candle still letting up small wisps of smoke.  He looks to
the general area where the book had been placed, and looks at it almost long-
ingly.  His breathing becomes labored, as he was clearly rooted to the spot.
He closes his eyes tightly, and as he does, the image slowly begins to fade
away into darkness, blotching up like a painted picture in the rain.  The last
visible thing is the man's hand, which remains where it is for the longest
time.  Finally, the hand lets go of the door handle, and the last bits of the
image fade into blackness...

On the coast lands, near the bay of ballfor, nearly 250 years ago, on the
night the two moons lit the sky, and the third moon was said to grace the
sky as well unseen to all but some.  A stiffled cry was sent out into the
silent night.  The midwife sat there wrapping the newborn son in the warmest
of blankets.  Gently cleaning the babes face and pacing around the bed to
lay him with his mother.  Turning "I will go and fetch some water" Closing
that door on another miracle she had attended.  These times by herself after
her job was done was always the hardest on her.  She found herself getting
eatin alive from the inside.  The knowledge of never being able to have a
child of her own was what made her choose her profession.  If she could not
have children then she was going to make sure others had there healthy
babes.  She was the best, and she was getting older, the only human in the
city she found herself jealous of there long lived life's.  How casually
they took life in a land filled with elves where childbirth was not that
common, .  And to have a child born with all three moons present!  Something
was different about this night.  Every other child she had walked away from
without a thought, but she couldn't let it go.  It was her turn to be a
mother.  So what if the child happened to be an elf!  She would raise the
child in her image her beliefs she had so much to teach so much to pass on
and no one to love.  She wiped her eyes before coming back into the house
with the water she had promised to find the father gone on an errand and the
mother sleeping soundly, her newborn babe nestled in a comfortable crook of
her arm.  The woman glanced about nervously her consciousness gnawing at her
insides.  Now is the time you'll never get an opportunity like this again! 
She reached in to grab the child, when the mothers eyes popped open.  Not
flinching in the slightest the lady whispered a few arcane words and a black
shadow of a hand reached out from the bed and clamped across the mothers
face suffocating her and trying to pull her through the bed.  And a toss of
a powder she vanished in a cloud of mist.  That night there were two wails
on the silent crisp air.  Living the life of solitude was something he came
to enjoy, yet something seemed to be missing for him.  The essence of life
just did not seem complete it followed him throughout his first years of
life.  Growing up not knowing his father but being told of his sea elven
father and heritage.  Not sure where his father had come from or even what
his name was his human mother Grailis had taught him everything he knew. 
She was a kind woman and had taken good care of him his entire life.  She
was an accomplished dabbler in the magic's, all self taught but with stern
beliefs of the right and wrong ways to handle magic.  She taught him the
basics of magic and found he had quite a talent for it.  Over the next 10
years she taught him everything she had learned.  Perhaps if he had stayed
with his elven parents his teachings would have been spread out through a
century, but in the short lifespan of a human things aren't that simple they
don't have the luxury of time.  Soon he came to find out exactly how frail
life truly was when the only woman he had ever loved lay on her deathbed. 
As she lay there looking up at her son her beautiful miracle child she
beckoned for him to come closer and wheezed out the one thing she had not
shared with him.  "I love you my son, There is something I have kept from
you your father his name your true moth."  The life fleeing fom her ragged
body taking her secret to the grave.  He buried her in her favorite spot for
sitting where you could smell the fields and hear the sounds of nature under
an old willow tree.  He took out his knife and carved in the trunk here lies
a loving mother may the three moons watch over her.  He left that same night
and never turned back not knowing where to go.  He had heard much of the
lands about him and he was in search for another tutor to widen his
abilities.  And in the back of his mind sitting there knawing at him What
did she mean a secret?  What about my father.  And the biggest mystery my
moth?  One foot in front of another running through his memories the
troubled youth walked the realms a young man in search of the tower of high
sorcery.  His mother had told him of it had described to him had even
created illusions of the place.  Only the finest mage's in the land were
accepted, and he was determined to be among them.

Jeslek: Jeslek's history
Sat Apr  1 22:02:38 2006
To: Anav nuantho alateriel darkahn
On the coast lands, near the bay of ballfor, nearly 250 years ago, on the
night the two moons lit the sky, and the third moon was said to grace the
sky as well unseen to all but some.  A stiffled cry was sent out into the
silent night.  The midwife sat there wrapping the newborn son in the warmest
of blankets.  Gently cleaning the babes face and pacing around the bed to
lay him with his mother.  Turning "I will go and fetch some water" Closing
that door on another miracle she had attended.  These times by herself after
her job was done was always the hardest on her.  She found herself getting
eatin alive from the inside.  The knowledge of never being able to have a
child of her own was what made her choose her profession.  If she could not
have children then she was going to make sure others had there healthy
babes.  She was the best, and she was getting older, the only human in the
city she found herself jealous of there long lived life's.  How casually
they took life in a land filled with elves where childbirth was not that
common, .  And to have a child born with all three moons present!  Something
was different about this night.  Every other child she had walked away from
without a thought, but she couldn't let it go.  It was her turn to be a
mother.  So what if the child happened to be an elf!  She would raise the
child in her image her beliefs she had so much to teach so much to pass on
and no one to love.  She wiped her eyes before coming back into the house
with the water she had promised to find the father gone on an errand and the
mother sleeping soundly, her newborn babe nestled in a comfortable crook of
her arm.  The woman glanced about nervously her consciousness gnawing at her
insides.  Now is the time you'll never get an opportunity like this again! 
She reached in to grab the child, when the mothers eyes popped open.  Not
flinching in the slightest the lady whispered a few arcane words and a black
shadow of a hand reached out from the bed and clamped across the mothers
face suffocating her and trying to pull her through the bed.  And a toss of
a powder she vanished in a cloud of mist.  That night there were two wails
on the silent crisp air.  Living the life of solitude was something he came
to enjoy, yet something seemed to be missing for him.  The essence of life
just did not seem complete it followed him throughout his first years of
life.  Growing up not knowing his father but being told of his sea elven
father and heritage.  Not sure where his father had come from or even what
his name was his human mother Grailis had taught him everything he knew. 
She was a kind woman and had taken good care of him his entire life.  She
was an accomplished dabbler in the magic's, all self taught but with stern
beliefs of the right and wrong ways to handle magic.  She taught him the
basics of magic and found he had quite a talent for it.  Over the next 10
years she taught him everything she had learned.  Perhaps if he had stayed
with his elven parents his teachings would have been spread out through a
century, but in the short lifespan of a human things aren't that simple they
don't have the luxury of time.  Soon he came to find out exactly how frail
life truly was when the only woman he had ever loved lay on her deathbed. 
As she lay there looking up at her son her beautiful miracle child she
beckoned for him to come closer and wheezed out the one thing she had not
shared with him.  "I love you my son, There is something I have kept from
you your father his name your true moth."  The life fleeing fom her ragged
body taking her secret to the grave.  He buried her in her favorite spot for
sitting where you could smell the fields and hear the sounds of nature under
an old willow tree.  He took out his knife and carved in the trunk here lies
a loving mother may the three moons watch over her.  He left that same night
and never turned back not knowing where to go.  He had heard much of the
lands about him and he was in search for another tutor to widen his
abilities.  And in the back of his mind sitting there knawing at him What
did she mean a secret?  What about my father.  And the biggest mystery my
moth?  One foot in front of another running through his memories the
troubled youth walked the realms a young man in search of the tower of high
sorcery.  His mother had told him of it had described to him had even
created illusions of the place.  Only the finest mage's in the land were
accepted, and he was determined to be among them.

Subject The Second Dream~
Text
When you would sleep this night, once again, dreams not of your own
seem to haunt your mind.  It starts off as it did before:  In darkness.
The darkness swells like a storm at sea, though its songs were soothing
to the soul.  The darkness of the dream suddenly springs to life, taking
shape and definition.  Tendrils envelope your vision, forming into vari-
ous things such as obsidian pillars, a vast room, a great throne; the area
you've been set in obviously a throne room of sorts.  The last of the dark-
ness swirls in the air until everything took its proper definition, then it
split in two; one part went to the throne and took the form of a massivley
obese devil, while the other went just before the throne and took the form
of a child-like, four-winged angel.  The devil, seeming to be amused, chuckles
ever-so-happily.  The angel grits his teeth, the soft white glow of his skin
is the only source of light in this godforsaken place.  "{CCall off the Inevita-
bles!  I know how you're controlling them!  I swear, hurt Darkahn and it'll
be your last!{X"  The devil's mouth forms a wide, toothy grin at the angel.
"{DNo.{X" It said.  Not liking the responce, the angel clenches his fists.  He
spreads his wings in a second, and it takes him that long to be grappled
with the devil, clutching the obesity of its neck with his fingers, "{CThen
i'll kill you.{X" Still chuckling, the devil grabs the angel around the
waist with one hand then stands.  It pins the angel to the ground, repla-
cing his hand with a foot.  Grinning with glee, the devil rips off some of
its own fat with a clawed hand.  The fat squirms, and in an instant, it
turns into a writhing, squeeling creature.  The devil kneels down, holding
the angel's small body in place with just its leg.  "{DNevermore, Aerogos.{X"
the image darkens, fading into blackness, giving one last sight of the
devil forcing the creature into Aerogos' mouth before the dream fades.
 
This time, the dream picks up elsewhere with Aerogos in a small cell just
barely large enough for him.  Its nearly pitch black, save for his white-
glowing skin.  Aerogos is writhing and convulsing in his cell, screaming
at the top of his lungs.  His eyes, with which tears force themselves out
of, are bloodshot and tormented.  Through this, Aerogos screamed the same
thing over and over again, but from the torment in his voice, what he said
could not be understood.  The scene goes on for days at a time.  Slowly, his
skin becomes bluish purple, as though it were being suffocated of blood, and
it looses its white glow.  His golden hair fades to fair, then to white, be-
comming stringy and greasy.  His eyes, however, are the most important change
in his features.  The pupils in his eyes convulse just as wildly as he does
glowing sapphire blue.  Finally, after either days, weeks, or months, the
writhing stops.  The pupils in his eyes are always the same, but he stops.
The light leaves his eyes, as though his very soul had been taken from him.
Slowly, Aerogos stands, and he simpily walks through one of the walls in his
cell.  In the distance, explosions of tremendous power can be heard.  The
death cry of something demonic rings through the air, quickly followed by
another explosion.  Then, your vision follows the direction Aerogos had
went, back into the throne room.  It shows Aerogos crouching over the
twitching corpse of the same devil, and Aerogos himself grinning from ear-
to-ear, laughing a broken laugh, and tears streaming from his eyes.  The
dream fades once again, though this time not forming into another.  The
last sound heard from the dream was a broken, distant voice...

Subject Akiran's parting gift to me~
Text
As I read Akiran's scroll, I was disappointed to hear him leaving, so I decided to go visit him one last time before he departed.
Arriving at his house in the forest, I was greeted by two elves who showed me in.
Akiran greeted me with a smile, brewed some herbal tea and gave me some herbs to ingest.

He discussed some clan buisness and handed me his ring of the Head Forest Recruiter and appointed me the head recruiter of the Foresters.  I thanked him heartedly and wished him good luck in his travels.

He told me to take it along with an herbal guide as a parting gift.
He told me that a new leader would be appointed for the Foresters and he told me to go out and recruit new members to fill the ranks.

I waved goodbye and he walked saw me out.
Akiran and the Elves watched as I uttered an incantation and dissapeared into thin air.
 
This was the last I saw of my mentor.

A young man, around his 17th year, has been seen lately asking around the back alleys of Palanthas
concerning tales he's heard about a guild of thieves within the city. A guild informant witnessed the young
man apparently hypnotize a local merchant and ask him questions about upper echelon members and how to
contact them. His name as far as we know is Talin, and though his questions are alittle tiresome, he does
not seem to be anyone of any exceptional power. Well that's everything, what should we do about it?

{DSoft, well placed footfalls sound throughout the area of Aesthetics Row as the young mage travels down its semi deserted length. Her velvety crimson robes give way her detication to Lunitari and the many pouches about her waist show her obvious preference to magic. Her head remains erect, turquoise eyes ever wary of their surroundings as they peer forth through a veil of coppery, silkened bangs. 
 
Eventually the maiden reaches her destination, outside the door of a beautiful Library. Precise steps bring her into its core, where rows and rows of countless books rise high above her petite stature. She seats herself within a small, wooden chair, and pulls from her pouch a roll of parchment as well as a quill and its accompianied vial of onyx ink. She sets down the parchment and begins to scribble upon it with that aformentioned writing untensil. 
 
{rSir Astinus,
 
I have been sent to give to you this letter in humble request from Masrer Nuantho Garein. He wishes acess to your beautiful quarters to search for any books you may have concerning the Age of Dreams. Both of our thanks are offered unto you if you decide to heed our request. Until we receive your reply, I hope you will remain well and may the ways of Magic be always on your side in your quest for Knowledge.

{DAfter concluding the letter and adding her signature at its end, Celebriel places away her supplies and rolls up the bit of parchment covered with her request. She stands gracefully, straightening out those robes of crimson before giving the parchment to The Guardian of the Aesthetics Order and nodding curtly. 
 
"{WI will have him send his response to you when he has the time, M'Lady,{D" speaks the guardian as he takes up the bit of parchment and nods to the young mage.

As soon as Cordani can, he brings himself to his feet and looks to the two dead guards with sympathy.  Two innocent lives ruined, if not lost because of his rage.  He starts cursing himself, beating himself up in his mind at his actions.  A true knight would never let their anger overcome them, a true knight would never strike like a coward as he has.  But still a part of him seems to agree and tries to reason, as if what happened was more of a saving act rather then one of a madman. 
At least he didn't step over the edge--lose his mind completely--who knows when he would've stopped if that had happened.
He quickly turns to the only place where he could take solace; the Last Call.
Cordani steps into the bar right as the barkeeper rings the brass bell, clocking the hour.  He starts unstrapping his armor well before he's halfway to the corner table he often dwells at; the same table his father before him sat at each night.  A lady notices the wounds and his condition, launches to her feet to assist him.
"Are you all right?" she asks, offering him a hand.
"Yes I am," Cordani replies.  He pauses to bow his head and properly thank her for her time before dismissing the fact that he need's any help.  She sighs exasperatedly before sinking back in her seat. 
"I told ya, he's a darn knight--They hold their pride over their very lives, Mary!" Her partner remarks as she takes a quick whisk from his tankard that he futile tries to keep from her.
"At least unlike you they something if anything..." she replies snidely then turns her gaze to Cordani, "...honor."
Cordani lets his head fall and quickly wipes a tear that managed to escape his tightly shut eyes.  In the eyes of others it may look like he just came from a reputable battle, but he knows the truth and it bores down on his soul.  He has no honor, and years shall pass as he tries to gain some honor, and some respect for himself, from himself.

Days pass and I stay nights in an alley.  I try to tell myself it is punishment for the evil I continue to do, but I know better, I know it's because I don't want to find a place and I don't have the steel nor copper to afford a night even if I could find one.  The rain isn't letting up and I couldn't help but know it's no good for my armor.  I tap my javelin and shake my head trying to force myself asleep.  At least in my dreams all I see is black, all I hear is nothing, that's all I want.
 
The sun comes up and I feel it blanket me in warmth.  This is probably what it feels like to own a home, some land, something to look forward to.  I smile because for the moment I think I'm happy.  I don't believe I truly know what it means, but my soul feels alive until the darkness comes over me again.  My smile fades and my fists clench, revealing to me the pain my body suffered yesterday.  I let my eyes open and I take my time to get accustomed to the light.
My javelin acts as a hand as I place it firmly on the ground to lift myself up.  Taking in a deep breath I try to feel good again, but it's gone, the feeling's gone.  As I fully wake up I notice a figure's been standing not two meters away.  I look upon him and notice he's alone, is probably my height and maybe weighs twenty stones more.  His facial emotion is that of a controlled anger, something I'm very much used to.
"Is there something happening around me that I don't know?" I ask, my right hand feels the javelin it holds as if assuring it is there.
"Someone told me it was you," he says, "it was you that killed my brother!  He may have been a young and eager guard, but I have to know... was it you?"
I sigh exasperatedly and shake my head in doubt, hoping I could say no and that it would be truthful.
"If he was one of the two that lay dead on Bough street then it was I.  You can go get the rest of the guards, I will not flee," I answer.  I consider going to jail, or even getting killed here as punishment.  Anything would probably be better then living with the dark torment that I suffer everyday. 
"It was you... it was you," the man repeats, considering what to do with the answer.  He unsheathes his blade, a steel broadsword, and narrows his eyes with hatred.  "I will not take this to the city, I will handle it myself!  Take your weapon to arms bastard, so that I may avenge my brothers death!"
My javelin radiates with electricity and I feel compelled to fight him, the darkness, the urge.  I cannot succumb to it again, already.  I turn my head and drop my weapon.
"If you want to kill me, go ahead."
"I will not strike you before you're ready, pick up your weapon!" he demands, gripping his sword's hilt even tighter.  I drop my shield and snatch my javelin with both hands, lunging forward.  I try to tell myself I'll go easy and let myself lose, but I can feel my anger and I can feel the tension in my arms.  Our weapons collide and he strategically falls to his knee and swings his blade, angled upward, toward my gut.
 I push myself backward with both my feet, but the sword slices through my breastplate and grazes me.  I quickly check myself then glance at his sword, it looks as if he came prepared as it's edge looks sharp enough to slice a thread of hair.  I thrust my javelin forward to no particular area and he quickly deflects, grabs my arm with his elbows and twists it so that my javelin slips from my hands and lands on the ground. 
I try to recover but I cannot think fast enough and am quickly on the ground.  The sword comes down and grazes my cheek, the pain forcing my eyes tightly shut.
"Pick up your weapon," the man orders.  I slowly open my eyes to see, to see that I'm still alive.  The tip of the sword is rested on my face.  I quickly snatch my javelin and then get booted in the side.  "Get up and get out of here!  I don't want to see scum like you in this city, again!" He threatens before sheathing his blade and taking his leave.
I gather myself up and feel the scar left on my face.  It burns, worse then normal.  I feel the entire side of my face going numb, as if my life was slowly being sucked from the wound.  I latch my javelin to the back of my breastplate and stagger out of the alley, praying for Chemosh to take my soul, yet at the same time yearning for the forgiveness of Mishakal.
<*>
It has been some time--several months I believe--that I've visited the port city of Port O Call.  As I walk down the street I pass civilians and other travelers.  They glance upon me and smile or nod their heads, something about a knight's presence makes them feel safer.  I cannot return a smile nor a nod as my sins cannot be accounted for nor forgotten with such gestures.
Every time I pass a city guard--whether they be on duty or going home--my hands twitch and I nervously grasp at my javelin to make sure it's there.  I don't do it in thought, but my body knows I'm scared.
I feel my skin tingle and the invisible eyes bore down upon me.  But it doesn't matter, as long as those visions don't come back.  Curse that mage!  What was his name?  Talwin, yes, that is it!  Him and his stupid gem, what has it done to me?  That memory it showed, it wasn't mine--was it?  Those people that were slaughtered, was that from my anger and rage?  I can't remember anything from before the darkness encompassed me in Palanthas.

Is my name really Cordani?  Or is that just a memory?  Damn, even as I am I wasn't this angry.  If that mage didn't cast those magick's on me, or whatever he did that made me get this memory--the same memory replays over and over and every time I see it clearer and clearer.  The worse thing though, that person in the visions, the one I feel is me... he's dead.
 
*THUD!*
I bump into a lady by accident.  Her sack falls and it's contents fall out.  I bring myself back to reality and I quickly move to gather what dropped at my fault.  She seems stunned, as if she also was in thought when we collided.  I give her back her snack and brush a head of spinach off before putting it back atop her belongings. 
"Thank you, sir knight," she says, beaming a heartfelt smile as if it were her fault.
"No need to thank me ma'am, it was my mistake and I owe you an apology," I answer with a brisk shake of my head.  That's when I notice she has two a backpack and another sack burdening her down.  I think I can help and although know it's far from what I must do for redemption, at least it's something.
"You seem to be burdened down a might, would you care for a hand?" I offer.  She weakly smiles and starts to decline but I have nothing of it, quickly removing the sack from her shoulder and hoisting it on mine.
"Where do you live?"
 
Once we arrive to her place of residence I keep my distance and allow her to make known of my company.  At first it seems as if the owner was thankful until he gets a better look at me.  I know he looks familiar, the scorn on his face further strengthens that presumption.  He snatches the sack out of my hand and pulls the lady in--she's most obviously his sister.
"Have I done something wrong?" I inquire, sheathing my sword as I had brought it out to salute the family before I was either welcomed or dismissed.  He quickly reaches in the house and then steps out, closing the door.  The look on his face, his eyes, it is then when I remember seeing him before.  In the alley, the guard's brother. 
"I'm sorry," I apologize and quickly turn away to leave.
"Stay your ground!" He demands.  My hand moves from my sword to the javelin latched on the back of my breastplate.  I pray he doesn't wish to fight me, it will only satisfy the darkness watching over me and enrage the anger that I do my hardest to keep calm.
"I-I don't wish to fight you," I say, turning around to face him.  Though those are my words, I know I feel otherwise.  He can see it, he can see that something inside me wishes to unleash itself and bring down the wrath of the heavens on him.  But that is not what I really want, it is just something I really cannot comprehend nor control right now.
"You killed my brother and now you're here to torment me and my family?  I let you live, hath I made a mistake?"
I do not answer, I cannot answer.  I am no true knight yet I try to make myself believe I am bound to some code of honor.  I wish to explain myself, but I deem not to.  I just look him in the eye and hope he would act accordingly to what he is bound to as a knight.
As time slips by I notice his grip on his sword loosen, he shakes his head and turns away--no scowl, no warning, not even an acknowledgment.  I sigh, pivot on my heel and make my way back to the city.  Has he forgiven me?  I cannot even forgive myself yet I am walking away in one piece.  Or is it the Gods are shunning down on me, forcing me to suffer.  But I can take my own life, can't I?  Is that my destiny?
As I walk in thought the vision comes back, the pain wreaks through my veins.  I gasp for breath but soon all I can see is darkness, all I can feel is cold.  I see a sword rise, a blackened sword with runes of such that pain my heart.  I feel a rage inside me that I cannot even comprehend.  The mage Talwin is there in my visions, I feel as if I know him.  I know my name, it's Cordani--but not Cordani Threshold?
There are others I can feel, there are memories that are not my own.  Skeletons charge pass me and I shiver in mind, but in this vision, I know them!  They are my men, aren't they?  Chemosh, I feel the power of Chemosh in me.  It is then I realize that in this vision--in this truth--I am dead.
As sudden as it happens it is over.  It is night and my stomach growls for some indulgence.  I look around and feel cold--as if I am still dead--but soon the warmth comes back to me and I realize where I am.
Is what I see what I am, what I used to be, or what I am to become?  And if it is so, if any, how did that mage trigger such?  And with this knowledge, will I still falter to the path in which is before me?
I close my eyes and take in a deep breath. It is not the Gods I seek forgiveness from--it is not even myself--it is the countless souls of mortal men of which I have brought suffering to.  As I have dedicated myself before--though then I did not have much a guidance as I do now--I shall dedicate myself again to challenge the heavens and step forth in the faith of the mortals to shed the light on those blinded by the Gods they follow.
My burden shall weigh me down to the abyss but I shall lift others up so that my sins will be redeemed in their eyes.

I sit in last call, drowning my sorrows with a tankard of ale.  I keep my eyes closed as I replay the events that took place behind these walls not but a week ago.  My feet impatiently tap the wooden floor and I try to keep my breathing calm, as even in thought the visions tear at my soul.
The mage Talwin and his cursed ruby unleashed upon me what not even I can explain.  I was there but I could only watch as something, whatever it was, over powered my body and mind.  I felt the uneasiness of the darkness-the slithering inside my veins-the blood upon my skin.  I couldn't control the rage, though I felt as if whatever possessed me had complete control over it.
After a while I didn't fight it--I don't know if it was the power or the complete assurance the presence had, but I liked it.  I saw my aspirations come true while the darkness embraced me.  The power I had within me I knew I would be able to challenge the Gods without the long toil that currently lay ahead.  But I also know I cannot trust that power as it held no feelings toward those I care for and it disregarded what I try to uphold in myself in being a knight.
Even now as I drown myself with aleI can feel the dark presence inside of me, and I also feel as if those dark orbs that are watching me in wait are satisfied.
I shake my head and push up from my table.  The power is tempting, but how can I give up what I've been so hard at trying to build up?  My honor.
I remember my talk with Darkahn and how most, if not all of the mortals with the immediate power to step up to the Gods do not.
But if I give up my honor then what will hold me from giving into the darkness and temptations when I do challenge the Gods?  What will hold me to my original goals?  But if I wait, how long will it take before the flame burns out?
My head is lowered as I leave the bar.  I trod down Bough street and take some time to go over my thoughts.  Is the darkness worth the time it will take for me to achieve the power naturally?  But even if it isn't, will I ever be able to achieve such power in life?
My thoughts are interrupted as I come upon a brawl between two rowdies.  A man never interrupts another man's fight, I tell myself, but still my hand nervously grips and unlatches my javelin.
"Hey!  What is going on here?" A guard yells out, rushing over to the scene.  I glance at the men who quickly separate as the guard approaches with his mace in hand.  They mutter something to each other and then quickly greet the guard.  I just stand there, wondering what's going on.  Fingers point.  The guard sends a fierce glare to me.  This is why I should've kept walking.
"Wait," I try to explain, but my arm is quickly grabbed as the guard attempts to thrust me against a wall.  I stand my ground and extend my other leg for better resistance.  "I had nothing to do with this!"
He quickly opens his mouth to speak but as quickly falls to the ground, yelping in pain.  One of the men struck a sharp dagger in his back and the other stands there with his large, muscular arms crossed.
"Get out of here, boy!"  They warn me.  My eyes widen at the act and the grip on my weapon tightens.  "What, you here for a fight as well?"
I easily defend against the smaller man with the dagger, though he tries futilely to harm me with his cheap attacks.  But the larger man, the warrior, manages to bring me down in not even four blows.
As they leave and I lie, hanging desperately onto life, I realize that no matter how much longer I train I never will be able to stand up to the Gods, not as the cursed knight, the weak mortal, that I am.  And I also realize how foolish I would be if I expect to depend upon one with the attunement to the magicks to stand aside me, or for me.  The mortal men need leaders, but ones with as powerful a step as a vision.
'Take my soul so that I may embrace the darkness,' I pray, tears stroll down my eyes.  There is nothing I have to lose in embracing the darkness, the rage.  There is none in all of Ansalon who would shed a tear for the life of just another mortal in his passing day.  At least with the power the darkness, the death has to offer, I will be able to stand before the Gods on my own.  For no mortal will follow me unless they see afore that I possess the strength to challenge the Gods, and that, I do.

The Gods WILL give way to those that are rightly entitled to all of Ansalon!  All dwarves, elves, kender, human, every race, every kin, we of mortal men shall stand our ground and take claim to what is ours.
But that will come in time, for there always has to be the one who steps first into the waters before the rest are brave enough to stand for themselves.  I am Cordani, and if anything, I will go down leaving behind a legacy for the sons of mortals to learn upon.
 
It is just another day for most people, but not for me.  I watch as the sun slowly sets, and I know it is time for me to take action.  With my loyal steed I gallivant through Solanthus in search for a lone dragonarmy officer.  The air gets cooler and the smell of rations growing stronger, but that does not stay my mind for very long as I quickly spot what I'm looking for.
This when my journey shall begin, and it shall not end until either I die, or the Gods give way.
There, adorned in his blood streaked armor and walking in full stride with his large and bloodied axe in hand is the dragonarmy officer I am looking for.  His eyes are that of a determined, yet weakened mortal.  I shake my head and tell myself it is for a better cause.  Those words reach my lips and he looks my way.  I think about reconsidering, or at least that's what I mask my fear as telling myself, but I know that I'm fighting for a cause, so I know I will win.
"For the future!" I quietly cry out, gripping my sword tightly as I rush him.  He brings his axe up to defend and as the two connect a loud clang rattles the streets. I pray to finish the fight before it draws any attention.
The axe almost immediately afterward swings low and cleaves my left thigh, forcing that leg to back-step and my right foot to pivot forward.  I manage to take advantage of the situation and quickly end the fight, using the momentum to thrust my sword into the officer's neck.  
Blood trickles down the razor sharp blade of my sword and eventually meets with my gauntlets.
I waste no time and fall to my knees, ignoring the pain that jolts through my body, quickly stripping the officer of his suit.  I breath hard and sweat pours down my forehead and palms as I hide the body in an alley for none to find, knowing I will come back to finishing the job, cover my tracks.
Wiping the sweat from my forehead I take in a deep breath and then bundle the gear up and mount my steed. 
 
Before the High Clerist Tower, on the High Knight road, I watch as a Solamnic Knight patrols the grounds.  The sun is almost fully set and though the knight seems to be walking a bit farther then the regular patrol, he is still in quite visible range of the other guards.
I take in a deep breath and whisper into my horses ear, take a good few steps toward the Knight.  My heart is racing, the burden of my armor isn't helping either.
'Well-- forgive me, for this is working toward a better cause--' I speak, approaching the knight with my head hung down.  My hand is on the hilt of my sword, and I can feel the dry wind brush through the open cracks of my armor, chilling me even more so, twitching my nerves.
'What are you talking about, sir?' The knight proudly asks, unaware that this will be the last day he brandishes the tainted steel of the Knights of the Crown.
'I will attone for my sins afterwards.  I cannot explain it to you, it will only make things harder on myself; you will die today,' I declare, quickly reaching back to smack my horse with the blunt side of my sword.
The guard glances about for reassurance of the other guards but my steed gallops forth toward the tower, grabbing the attention of the nearby guards who quickly rush to restrain it.  The guards on the tower walls also peer down to the horse, wondering what idiot could've left it out there?
'I am sorry!' I finally apologize, my sword quickly swinging forth as I push off toward the knight.
The knight cannot unsheath his weapon before I plunge my sword into his breastplate, grazing his chest and slicing his ribcage.  But that only gives me a slight advantage as he moves with the momentum of my lunge, throwing us both to the ground.
I try to free my sword but he connects two powerful blows to my face, almost knocking me out cold.
As my eyes jolt open each time his fist hits I can see my own blood being shot from my nose, but even so, all my mind sees is the greater vision, what I am working toward.  I cannot let some Solamnic Knight stand in my way.
As he regains footing and is about to call for help I kick him with my right leg with such a force I break his leg.  He falls on my left leg, which is already sore from the last fight, forcing me to yelp in pain.  But right now pain is the least thing on my mind and through determination I recover quickly and unveil a dagger hidden in my hard ankle sheath.  The metal feels smooth as it practically glides in my hand, the cool hilt bringing a warm assurance of victory.
 
My steed comes galloping back as I whistle for it.  I hoist myself and the dead Solamnic knight on the saddle, then gallops toward Solanthus.  None of the guards caught a glimpse of what happened, forcing a wry and twisted smile to my face.
As we are clear from any unwanted witnesses I cease my horse and throw the dead knight to the ground.  I rest my sore body on a tree stump as I rummage through my belongings for some paper and ink.

I sit there on the tree stump, letting my body settle down and my heart calm as well.  The wind blows by me and I can feel the hint of rain in the cool breeze.  I consider what to write, knowing the effect I want from this.  My horse walks up to me, as if searching for answers to what I have just done--or maybe that is just what I want, someone, something to arise for me explain myself.  And so I lighten the grip of my fist as I start inking the paper, and look to the horse to speak.
'How can we bring followers to our cause if there is no reason?  We need war!  With war, sorrow will be forced upon countless lives.  Pain, suffering,' I take in a deep breath, 'these are the things that make people think, really think, and actually make choices on how they're living and what they're doing.
'If I can spark a war between the two, then I will also spark the minds of the mortals who may be our only hope when I confront the Gods.  If they can think about why they are going to slaughter each other, for the interest of their God, then perhaps they will see what I see.  Through the lies that their Gods thrust upon them, through the torment and sorrow their Gods force them to suffer, and yet in return they still get nothing, not even proper respect or acknowledgment from their so-called Gods!' 
 
My steed turns his head away.  I understand, wisdom is something not for animals, which tempts me to think about the Draconian scum that may never be able to see beyond their foolish Gods.  But they are still mortals and one day I will have to accept them as I do the rest, though they may be the hardest to convince and also the race whose choices may be the fate of my campaign.
I finish writing the note and watch as the ink quickly dries.  I hear the faint noise of horse shoes and quick shove the note into the lifeless hand of the Solamnic Knight.  
After that I quickly walk over to my belongings and release the axe and dragonarmy suit that I brought with me.  Being much too large for me to wear I use my steed to help me saunter about, as if I were an actual dragonarmy officer.  One wouldn't be able to tell from a far distance that I am an imposter, but I do not expect to keep this up much longer; just an impression, that's all I need.
 
As I return to the city of Solanthus I take refuge near a local guard tower.  There I speculate interest of action towards the Solamnic Knights, hoping for the right passerby to overhear me.  It isn't long before they throw me out, but that is all right, Osiris can always use some company--and I'm dying for some jerk chicken.

*An Aesthetic runs as fast as she can, carrying a stack of books. One drops, but isnt noticed and is left there. Picking it up, you open the cover to hear a very familiar deep mumble, it says-*
{gI never thought I would see the day when a fellow dwarf, most trusted guardian, best friend, and closest ally would join together and slay someone.
Never have I thought Vengeance to be so powerful, I have a new respect for him in full now. My lifes collections and works are all gone, my body now compost for a garden; at least life is coming out of that.
Power is a great thing to all who are listening, do not be so absorbed in it that you would kill to achieve it.
Mastering insight and predictions are a valueable asset. I tried to have enough insight and predictiveness to try and save those who collect, research, and guard knowledge. Is the life of one worth the lives of hundreds, no matter how dear that one life may be to you?
I have lived a full life, even though in my death I was still very young. I have witnessed alchohol to its maximum potential, gotten at least twenty new members into the Aesthetics, who have all, for the most part, have made me as proud as anyone can be, and have written books, but all of those have been destroyed and stolen.
Its funny really, youd think the knights would do something, sense I was slain right in front of them, but they just watched. Even Crysania.
And its also funny, because I dont think my name will be mentioned in any books, or even a funeral, but thats alright.
I have been both blessed and cursed. I have been granted enough life to write the book in your hands, but not enough death to get me back to my resting place. I will forever wander, gaining knowledge, but never able to say it. The only way is for me to write these same books, but this is wasting your time, Ill get back on topic.
Betrayel is the real winner here. I always thought of it to be a trifling thing, a washback Immortal, but maybe it is the strongest thing in this episode? I cannot say Life is, no matter how much I think of it.
Just a little tidbit of something here for the death records, I know the Governor would want that-
At 5 pm, Day of Ferramis, in the month of Cold Rust, Adamant Frozenforge dies of joint conspired murder at the Temples Fountain of Paladine.
My lifes work has been stolen, my body compost, my history a forgotten memory, but I am going to write stories such as these from the sights I see, and bring knowledge into this cold, cold world.

{DBefore you is the story of a warrior, who was never much of a warrior at all. Before you is the tale of Getsu Fuhma's absence, and of her return. This tale is drawn from the library itself and states only facts no opinons.Finaly, be well aware that the person you hear of in this story is not the same person as she is today and if you happened to know her before, or read this tale and then meet her, you would quickly relize this...
  {XGetsu stood at the west gate of the great city of Palanthas looking out over the Vingaard Forest. She could see now that this was the path that she would have to take. Three chances she had and all three she had failed. She hand not only failed herself though but also the ones around her, the people she loved and cared for. First was the Goddess Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness. Getsu had betrayed her in the worst way, not only turning her back on the queen of darkness but also the whole army.
  Next she had her chance with Zivilyn and the Aesthetics, but that was a lost cause, she was a knight a warrior, she had no intrest in books or the like. After, she had saught refuge with the Solamnic army going completly full circle but this chrade was over in a matter of weeks. Finaly she tried to work a way back in to the army of Takhisis the only place she had ever really felt home, but even then she was quickly turned away. The queen disliked traitors and most did not escape with their lives.
  Getsu stared off into the forest with her sword in hand, she would die the death of a warrior she thought to herself as she walked in silence toward the forest. She had planned to march into the forest knowing that parts were infested with trolls and would fight untill they over came her, and this is exactaly what se did, fore there was no one left to turn her path. 
  She stood encircled by trolls. She had took at least twenty and was wearing down, and even now twice that many surrounded her. This was the end she thought to herself, an end well fit for a warrior. The trolls began to bear down on her. This was the end...
  Getsu lying on her back looked up to a pure white sky. This is it she thought, this is what the afterlife looks like, but that notion quickly faded as her vision slowly came into focus for her to only relize that she was looking up into a blue sky and many tree brances, she was still in the forest.. Getsu sat up with a sigh, what had happened why was she not dead? 
  She started to stand but stayed still. There was an old man about fifteen paces away that she must have overlooked and it had startled her to think anyone else would be here. 'What has happened, and Why are you not dead, you ask', said the old man. 'Well let me answer those questions for you my dear. 
  What has happened is that you have tired to kill yourself and why you are not dead is my doing.' Getsu's mouth opened and the closed again he had basicly stated what she had already knew, except for the part that it was his doing that she was still alive.  The man looked so weak and frail...The old man stared at her a moment before continuing 'To be more to the point you are not dead bescause it is not you time to die, you still have a pupose left on this would of Krynn. 
  Now what that might be I am not sure of but for the time being this is how its going to be...' He paused listening for protest before he continued 'You from now on will not carry nor weild a weapon or armor. You will live in the city of Palanthas as a normal local minding your own bunissness and not interfearing with anything.
  As long as you do this an immortal of which I do not know of yet will come to you may they be good or evil and this is the one you shall be bound to for the rest of you living life. This one will find you your purpose..and then and only then must you take up armor and sword again' The man smiled and winked before dissapearing leaving no trace that he had ever been there.
  Getsu stood starting to walk back toward the city already sheading her sword and armor with only one goal in mind...

"-   I hold a clay mug eye-level over the counter of the Last Call.  I'm slouched over another tankard which I had earlier downed, my undershirt wet in circumstance.  I refrain from taking any more ale, staring at the mug before placing it back on the counter and then having my head follow.  I moan in pain and shake my head, brushing aside the tankards.  Clenching my fist painfully, recalling the events that led me here, the events I've carefully planned and executed save for the magi, Talwin.
Matter of fact I am still recovering from the serious injuries I've suffered from confronting that magi.  Him and his Conclavian's--I spit in disgust at the thought--I would have killed him if it weren't for his being a coward, needing those other magi and all.  I can still remember the black robes they wore, the look in each of their eyes.  The woman bore an eerie resemblance to someone I've met before, I just know it, just not sure of who.
I still wonder, even this time I hadn't felt the power I did that-that horrible night.  I almost killed someone I deeply care for, possible other innocents around me.  I was overwhelmed.  But still, I want that power back.  That mage is hiding something from me.
I sigh.  The barkeep slaps me across the head with his ragged cloth, muttering something about my presence.  I snarl at him and reaching into my pouch, toss my last four steel coins on the counter.  He sends me a look, that look that says, 'You still owe me two-hundred more for all you've done!  Once you're paid, you're out!' 
What makes him think I'll pay now?
Shaking my head I brush my beardless chin and wonder how the Mercenaries are doing, and wondering how long I can rely on them?  I know that the nobles in every city I've visited has the steel to keep me providing the Mercenaries, but how long will they keep taking my steel?  As long as they can help me provoke the war between the Solamnic Knights and the Knights of Takhisis.
I quickly down the ale in front of me and close my eyes.  Sure there are some knights I would like to live through the war.  I'm doing this for all mortals, after all, but sacrifices must be made.  If everything goes as planned, I'd be more then willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the cause.
 
I leave the Last Call.  My modest steed awaits there for its master.  Smiling at my only friend, the only one I trust anyways, I grab the reigns and hoist myself to the saddle.  I get an intent glance from a cloaked figure who seemed to have tried to take my steed, blood dripping from his sleeve.  I shake my head and pull on the reins, slapping the hide of my horse.  We ride out of the port city and head North.
With the time it should take for me to get to Palanthas, everything should be nicely in place.  Impeccable--I tell myself--like my blade, this journey so far has been moving better then smooth.
 
Taking camp at nightfall I realize something keeps telling me that these mortals are not worth my effort.  From the senseless, purely evil Draconians to the awe-inspiring, powerful-in-every-way Dragons.  They too are mortals, and hopefully they will stand by me in my cause.  My eyes close, I slowly drift away, the knight I had fought with on my mind.  Maybe... I can make this... journey more... interesting.
At sunrise I am ready and mounted.  My restless steed raises its head to let me know it's been ready since before I woke up.  I smile and nod, 'To Palanthas, friend,' I direct.
 
It is many nights, but I eventually reach my destination.  My steed is tired, I myself am rider-worn.  I try to relax my tense muscles and sooth my cramps, but it would take more then a nights rest to do that.  Sighing, I look around.  Here I am, before the great headquarters of the Solamnic Knights.
I pat my warhorse and take in a deep breath to suppress the anxiety and fear growing inside me; there are only two outcomes from going in there; I come out, reveling in knowing how correct I've been in assuming the Knight's morales, weaknesses, or, I do not come out at all.  This journey has barely started and if I die this early on, shows how much of a fool I am.   -"
 
 
"And that is all you remember?" A man in a long, tattered brown robe questions.  I cannot even see his eyes, though I would swear that they were not eyes, yet red orbs that hold the fears, sorrows, and pain of Krynn with them.  I am slightly fidgeting, heavily shivering from the pain I am in.
"That is all I remember," I answer, narrowing my eyes.  "Though I do know that I got through to their leader,"
"I thought that is all you remember.  Explain,"
"I cannot.  It is like a dream, as if I know what happened yet it's fleeting!"  I retort angrily, trying to clench my fist in anger.
"I can taste the Dark Queen's hand in this.  You do know you're just an early test for what she has in store for all of Krynn?"
"That bitch has no control nor influence over me.  She too will cower once I take my stand," I insist, trying to stand in confrontation, but cannot feel my body.
"You are a fool, Cordani."
"How did you know my name?"
"I know more then your name, rest knight.  The Gods will not let you fail just yet, nor will I."  The man looks at the wound in my side which, visibly, seems all right.  Though with what the Solamnic Knight did, his prayer to Paladine, his prayer to the light, did not heal me.  If it wasn't for reasons I cannot explain, I know that the Knight's prayer would alone burn my heart with it's pure intention.
"Are you-are you a God?  Tell me!"
The darkness fades.  I lose consciousness.

It was one of those nights. The guard was thinking as the 
rain pounded around him soaking his chainmailand his 
heavy cloak. The moon was peaking out from beneath a 
cloud, lighting up the courtyard. A poorly paved stone 
walkway led through beautiful rose bushes, the once 
proud courtyard of House Tellenvard was no more. As the 
guard reminisce d abotu past glories at the behest of the
deceased master the cloud covered the moon like a soft 
blanket dimming the yard into blissful darkness. 

A loud clanking came from the left, the old soldier tensed 
and drew his short sword. Holding the sword ready he 
moved from under his meager cover into the night, spying
 a figure walking blithely across the courtyard he dashes 
towards him. The figure stumbles and falls back when he 
sees the shape of the old man rushing him, in a voice that
 squeaks of youth he calls out, 'Wh-who goes there?' With
 an angry growl the old man sheathes his sword and 
replies, 'Its me, Quil, Mi'lord Strivon. What are you doing 
out in this dreadful weather?' 

'I just wanted to go for a walk, you know how mother is. 
Never lets me do anything because she's scared I'll hurt 
myself. Dads death.. She's never recovered you know, she
 needs someone.' The boy looks meaningfully at the old 
man, 'Like you.'

'We've gone over this before... I will do no such thing. Nor 
will i explain myself to you.' With an abrubt gesture he 
points at the house, 'Go back inside before we both get 
scolded for you being out this late.' He waits for Strivon to
 start off towards the house befor returning to his post.
 After a moment he reaches the cover and gets slightly 
comfortable. Damned kid should know better then to- His 
thoughs get interrupted as twig snaps loudly mere feet 
away from him. 'Strivon I told you to go back to the house.
' he growls in an irritated voice. 

'Ah... Well sir, I'm not this Streevin fellow.' A rough voice
 responds moments before a flashing blade enters the old
 mans chest, driving up beneath the ribcage to pierce the 
heart. With a quick twist the shadow pulls the bloodied 
dirk out of the mans body making sure to get the blood off
 on the outtake. He pads quickly and silently across the 
coutyard darting from one shadow to another until he 
comes to a spot two stories below an open window. As he
 reaches his destination he moves his hands in a silent 
gesture and begins to float quietly up to the window, he 
grasps the window sill an instant before his levitation spell 
wore off, banging against the rough stone of the manor. 

With a soft curse he begins to to pull himself silently into
 the room, upon entrance the first thing he notices is it the
 beautiful woman lieing in bed. Her golden hair sprawls 
across the dark pillow, her pale white skin glowing softly in
 the brief moment the moons peaks through the clouds. 
Her small firm breasts stand firm, small pink nipples stand
 proudly in the cold air. As if knowing someone is watching
 her she turns over restlessly dislodging the blanket even 
more to reveal well rounded hips and the soft flesh of her 
buttocks. After a few moments staring at the beauty laying 
on the bed the man turns towards the mantle of the 
fireplace, a moment goes by as he locates the jewelry box.

He quickly walks over to it, taking another glance at the 
women he opens the box and begins to rummage through
 it. Grinning he pulls out a priceless diamond neckless, ten
 clear diamonds encased in gold links with ruby embedded 
in them, the thief makes a quick calculation and his grin 
broadens. He puts the necklace into a pocket of his vest 
and draws out a necklace from another pocket and places 
it into the vacated slot. He mutters a long string of words 
and it takes the appearance of the necklace he just stole.
 With another glance at the women he strides back to the 
window and jumps out. 

The remnants of his earlier spell allow him to simply roll 
and come up running to avoid injury. He ghosts silently
 through the courtyard and through the front gates, 
smiling all the way.

Night falls upon the port city...
 
 "One more soldier...wonder who will miss him eh?" the drunken gravedigger mutters, hauling himself
 out of the freshly dug grave. "Not my burden." shrugs the other man, tugging his cloak closer around
 himself to fight back the sudden chill in the air. "Bah...this place is depressing, even more so than
 the norm tonight. Lets get out of here and have a drink..." With that he dusts the dirt from his worn
 hands and climbs to his feet. Smirking to himself at his companions searching eyes, he claps his old
 friend on the shoulder. "Feelin' a chill are you?" he chuckles. His friend jumps slightly as he feels
 the hand touch him, culling another chuckle from the man. "Something feels strange tonight, like...
 like somethings watching us.......lets go, now..." "Eh? Don' be a fool Marcus, your minds just playin'
 tricks on you. Now how 'bout that drink?"
 
 The two men gather their tools and begin to walk from the graveyard, talking to one another as they
 pass the rows of gravestones. A low haunting laughter seeps from the misty night, causing the two to
 freeze suddenly. "What...was that?" the skinny man asks, his voice gone shrill with terror and a bony
 hand shaking upon the folds of his cloak. "Eh...nnothin'...jjjust keep goinn.." his friend answers,
 terror rising like a tide in his voice. He grabs his old friend by the arm and begins to rush now, the
 sounds of their boots echoing lightly in the silence of the graveyard. He sighs with relief as the
 gates materialize from the mist. "See....jjust some children havin' a laugh I'd wager..." His voice cuts
 short as he comes face to face with a rotting hulk of a man looming before the entrance. "Gods..." he
 whispers, reaching to grasp his friend by the arm. Nothing...he turns to look, finding his friend since
 childhood is running full out...leaving him here before this...thing. Sweat breaks across the mans
 body, waves of fear swelling within his heart as he meets the eyeless gaze of this nightmare...
 
 "Please....please...." he pants, arms and legs pumping in ryme as he vaults the gravestone before him.
 What was that? Oh gods, what was that thing? He stops, frozen to the spot as a scream of untold pain
 and horror rips across the silent night. "Garan..." he whispers once more, the tears already falling
 as his body begins to shake. He turns, the knowledge of death absolute now in his mind. There, walking
 from the misty dark...a hulking terror come to end his days. He closes his eyes, praying to any who
 will save him from the fate he knows is his. As the claws sink into his flesh, his own screams follow
 him down into the darkness.

As the hulking terror tears the flesh from Marcus a stone gargoyle
watches on silently, the cold crafted features of the stone minion seemingly
enjoying the spectacle playing out in front of it.  As the terror moves on
and the night draws deeper into the morning hours, something new awakens in
the graveyard.  The stone gargoyle the silent witness to the bloody horror
suddenly moves, fiery red eyes blink open, and the beast stretch's it's
wings.  The air about the creature shimmers with a dull green aura, as it
fades an emaciated draconian has replaced the stone gargoyle a thin smile
running her features.  "Oh well done, I did enjoy that.  I shall have to

I was impaled, wounded beyond mortal capability.  Not only did I have a sword thrust through my gut, but also the light of the God Paladine was scouring my very soul.  But the Gods weren't going to let me die, like Soth, I deserved worse then death.  I deserve life.
{m***{x
 
Days passed at the corner in the Portal, rolled up in a ball suffering in my own blood.  My presence was tolerated through the first night, mainly because most everyone were too disgusted to come within two meters of me.  But the second day I started getting the looks and the patrons gathered to carry me out.  Not a hand touched me as my visitor arrived.  Without having to cast a glance at the black robed mage, everyone could feel his presence.
 
When he leaves I am leaning against the wall, my thoughts racing.
My abdomen is fine now, perfect actually.  I knew beforehand it would be but still I am awe-struck.  My right hand, once flesh was ripped and hanging from my wrist, now perfectly healed.  Physically, I feel perfect.  But mentally--mentally I feel as if the wounds are still there, as if my heart is still pumping it's hardest to keep me alive--as if my hand were fragile and would rip from it's socket if it were touched a second time.  Mentally there is still the doubt.
At length my mind wanders to contemplate the hierarchies of the separate Knighthoods.  As I start thinking about those that have been involved throughout my years, I realize I can feel my  hand.  My gut is also starting to feel, human, again.  Finally, those moments of torture are over.  The holy touch and prayer of that fucking knight has been lifted from my burning heart.  The pureness that boiled my veins each time I've wronged has been alleviated. 
Looking at the pool of my spilled blood I am reminded of the heated altercation that resulted in me ultimately being impaled to the ground.  The way my veins ached in pain as soon as I struck that mage.  The way my lungs seemed to collapse each time I tried to fight, to once and for all finish off that coward.  The way I lost feeling in my legs, lost control of my body as the pain finally overpowered me.  Now that it is over, I have much-much to do.
{m***{x
 
I knew where I was headed but I wanted to enjoy the night, the cool thin air, before I went there. 
As I saunter by the fountain I hear soft footsteps to my side.  It is then I realize there is nobody else there except us two.  My eyes jolt fully open and my head turns to face the on-comer.  My right hand moves instinctually to the rough leather handle on my whip, brings a half-hearted smile to my lips as I revel in being able to feel my fingers.
"{cCordani?{x" The lady asks.  I perk a brow but immediately take a cautious step backward as my mind realizes that it isn't just us two.  There is a white beast of good size with her, a tiger, in between us.
"{yHow do you know my name?{x"  I demand.  Almost trip over a chipped cobblestone before I decide I'm a good distance from the lady's 'pet.'  Her eyes move about the area before landing on me, her gaze meeting my own though as if it's peering right through.  Even though she is blind and even though her 'pet' can only see so much for her, she seems to be well aware of her surroundings, of where I am, and something tells me of what I feel.
"{cI came to talk to you on behalf of-{x" 
"{yThat fool Paladine!{x"  I interrupt, scowling at her.  "{yHe has nothing to say that I wish to hear!{x"
There is a moment of silence, broken only by the Priestess's large tiger purring softly.  Crysania doesn't move her gaze from me though slightly leans forward to her pet, affectionately stroking her tigers hide with her delicate fingers.
"{cWhy are you so angered toward the Gods, Cordani?{x"  Crysania asks at length, her voice as soft as would allow of her.  The words easily carry through the thin air.  I don't know it it's out of sympathy or guilt but for some reason I feel compelled to explain myself.
"{yThe Gods are given up on us, on all of us!  Can't you feel their presence dwindling?  I'm doing this for all mortals, I-{x"  I start softly.  My eyes glance toward the modest Temple as I speak.
"{c-Are you sure you're not doing this for yourself?{x"  Crysania interrupts softly.  I choke on my speech, repress an unexpected tear and display of emotion.  "{cYour need to try and prove the Gods worthy-{x"
"{y-Unlike the elves who strive to prove themselves worthy of their Gods?{x"  I snarl, cutting her off.  The emotion of her face doesn't change, but she lowers her gaze.  I've been to one too many sermons to let her continue--I've been preached to enough and it was starting to just down right upset me.
 
There is another moment of silence.  As I peer off to the sky I could've sworn I caught a glimpse of the Black Moon, Nuitari, but mentally laugh at the presumption.  Heh, if only I were blessed with the attunement to the magical planes, maybe then I would be fairing better. 
My attention is brought back as I catch movement in the corner of my eye.  The tiger shakes restlessly then purrs again.  Realizing how dark it really is, I notice that Crysania seems to glow in the darkness--maybe it's just my mind running off again, misplacing the faint glow from her necklace as if it were her.
"{yHave you ever considered that us 'mortals' may want the Gods, just as they are?  Maybe we're not ready to move on?  Do you remember what happened when us 'mortals' forsook the Gods a-{x"

"{yWe have always been faithful!{x"  I interrupt, clenching my fist tightly.  "{yJust that the 'faith,' the 'loyalty' that these Gods demand of us is more then just our souls, it's our lives, our pride and our honor.  We fight for them, we die for them, we sacrifice our very souls to them..{x."  tears seem to escape my stern gaze, "{y..and they can't just let us live even moments in peace, without their influence.  Why can't we, just once, cry for ourselves?  Live for ourselves?  Love for ourselves?{x"
"{cThe Gods allow us every pleasure--they're the ones who gave us the opportunity to feel these pleasures.  Corda-{x"
"{yI will hear none of it!{x"  I yell, though break into a violent cough almost immediately.  My hands swing down to get hold of my gut, which still feels indifferent.  "{yThe Gods have not allowed us anything!  They shackle us down here and these 'pleasures' that you say they gave us, they're not; we feel for their very entertainment; they enjoy watching us break; watching us fail.  And even when they give some hope to succeed they quickly steal away that faithful soul!{x"
The anger pulsates through my veins as I speak in raised voice, though not loud enough to alert any of the citizens, or either the patrol of guards lazily making their rounds.  "{yLook at you, milady!  Tell me that your blindness is a blessing from your God!?{x"
For the first time before me I see the emotion on Crysania's face change.  She blinks back a tear and grits her teeth, holding back a harsh repute.  I lower my head shamefully; it's the Gods I'm angry at, Crysania deserves none of this.
"{cY-{x"  Crysania attempts to speak in a soft, controlled tone.  I know what she's going to say, I've heard enough and my words have hurt enough, this discussion is over.  I hold my hand up, my thumb pressing in my palm.  Crysania stops, her brows meet arched, as if she either saw or felt my gesture.
"{yW-when you can tell me how many fingers I have up, then I will speak with you.  Until then, do not preach to me about your... 'Gods,' {x"  I turn away.  My own heart is burning, she did not deserve that.  My fist clenches and I mentally swear that Paladine will pay for the false hope he continues to spread.
"{cF-four.  Four, Cordani.  When you're ready, I'll be here to talk,{x"  Crysania replies as I am three meters away.  I can hear the tears in her voice.  I spin around, astonished that she answered correctly; no one is there.
{m***{x
 
I saunter weakly down the empty streets, a cold breeze chilling my spine.  The prior conversation still on my mind, still pulling at my soul.  But I've reached my destination; no time to dwell on the past.  Inside these doors I will find the keys to the next doors in my goals; the histories of the families, individuals and heroes of Krynn.  I will find weaknesses, I will find truths, I will find strengths.  I pause, take in a deep breath.  I will find myself.

I can still smell that musky scent of all those tomes.  My hands even more calloused from the heavy sheets and leather bindings then even swordplay. But knowledge is power and right now that's the only thing that matters.  The war I'm insinuated is still a far-fetched image but it's slowly taking shape and I still need time to get everything organized.  Time seems to be flying though, days passing by my eyes where I just sit against a wall with my fists clenched and my eyes closed as I fight the darkness.
It's still watching me.  I can feel it--the desire burning in my veins.  What does it want with me?!
At least everything is slowly coming together.  I am making more acquaintances, though I am very concerned with the guilds and brotherhoods now.  Somehow I need to gain power within the ranks of these individualistic groups and though steel is a common language, I have found few who do not speak it.  And even those who do I find are held back by their own self-concern and power.  I need more control--time is all--I will succeed in time.
Even with all the thought and planning I put to this, I'm not sure how strong the alliances I build are or will stand.  I have to take better care to tend to them, I can't lose faith nor respect.  Not yet, not so early into this.  At least hopefully I can keep Hiddukel satisfied with the souls I bring to him.  Which, considering the slow progress of my man through the Knights, I should start fulfilling my part of our bargain.  I should meet with him again.
{m***{x
 
As the beggar falls lifeless to the ground, I stand there for a moment in my stiff, uncomfortable armor.  My eyes closed, both heart and mind further stained.  It didn't matter, n{yothing matters anymore{x.  My thoughts somehow slipping from my the hold of my mind and escaping in words through my lips.
Planning, I have planning to do.  People to write and steel to rob.  Those hobgoblins and that old fool of a quest master supplement my income fairly; definitely easier then raiding under-guarded manors.  At least this way I can keep calculations; whereas even the most reputable manors I've raided have had their steel in banks and forts I could never get to.
I carry myself weakly through the streets of Palanthas with the only thing keeping me from collapsing is the hopes that Hiddukel accepted that soul and that he fulfills his part of the bargain.  Heh, Hiddukel, I doubt he would--maybe next time I will let him in on what I'm doing--maybe that'll give him more incentive to deceive the Gods for me.
Then there's the darkness.
I feel the pull on me, how it laughs in satisfaction each day I progress in what I'm doing.  Every soul I reap for Hiddukel; every lie that passes my lip, it watches and weeps in satisfaction.  My blood still burns of it.  Sometimes I wish I were dead and would be if it weren't for knowing that I still have souls to seek remission from.  Somewhere I need to rest--I can't keep on my feet like this all day.
The Lord's palace is the one place in Palanthas where I can find solace--well, not maybe complete solace since it always seems to be bustling with merchants and nobles in search of the Lord Amothus, or in need of adventure (or work.. or even to snitch off of the wealthy,) but there is one place where I can find a little peace; the Lord's Quest Masters' office.
Here the few young 'uns running from their houses and the experienced traveller alike come in search of steel, and are often off for long days on their quests before returning.  I like that 'being gone for a bit' part, here is better then at that damned bar in Port O' Call.
"{cEh, boy, no tantrums this time?  'Cause last time you practically riled the entire palace guard'!{x" The old Questmaster remarks as I start loosening the straps on my armor.  "{cAnd I ain't been needing to explain why I let you aroun' here--I have enough trouble tryin' to explain why I hand out quests to Dark Knights and the like...{x" he finishes in a sly tone, winking suggestively.
"{yAs long as you don't go telling those fairy tales about me to all the young 'uns that come in here looking for an adventure,{x" I answer jokingly, resting my sheath against the wall.  "{yEspecially when you go putting in those twists of your own.{x"
The old Questmaster shrugs at my comment and comes to settle down next to me, seeing as his place is empty anyhow.
"{cI don't think I get it.  How can I trust you won't just erupt without warning?  You've done so on occasion I've heard...{x" Ye' Olde Questmaster pursues.  I spare him a glance through half-open eyes as I try to calm myself from the earlier encounter.  I can't find the right words to explain myself, don't know why I would care to--but I try to, at least to myself.
{yIt's hold over me, I-each time I do something to further this 'cause' of mine my soul gets just a drop of fulfillment--it teases me, keeps me going...{x I catch myself, my thoughts coming aloud, escaping the hold of my lips.  "{yBesides, trust that my word is as solid as steel.{x"
There is a brief moment of silence, disturbed only by my heavy breaths; my pulse still racing.
"{cAnd women--do they help alleviate this 'darkness' you keep speaking of?  Because correct me if I'm wrong but you're really all over the place...{x"
"{yYou have no idea what you're talking about.{x" I answer.  My lips twist into a wry grin and I shake my head, repeat myself, "{yYou have absolutely no idea.{x"

"{cHumor me.  I spend my time listening to tales of all y'young uns thinking the worlds burdening you down when y'all aint know what the world even has to offer.{x"
"{yYou want to know?{x" I stand, coming eye-level with the old Questmaster.  He does not move, his stern gaze meeting my own.  "{yI do what I have to do to get ahead.  People will say there's nothing stronger then love and if that's the case then I want the most powerful weapon on my side.{x"
"{cAnd what about her?  That knight...{x"
"{yWhat do you think?{x"
"{cI thought you loved her.{x"
And I thought I came here to calm down, for some silence.  Maybe I was wrong in thinking I could find any where to replace the last call.  The ale there was shit, the shrimp was stale and the bartender was an asshole, but at least I could just slump into one of the stalls, close my eyes, keep to myself and nobody would disturb me.  Well, maybe at the end of the day I'd be demanded of steel and threatened out by the barkeep, but still, that was a minor cost and I needed fresh air then anyways.
"{cDo you even know what love is?{x"
I cross my arms and utter something under my breath, my thoughts still in contention.  "{yLook old man, I know how to manipulate weapons.  Love, it's a foolish trait of mortals, a weakness the Gods believe they can control us under.  People would do anything for love, give up their lives, pride and honor for love.  Few would even give up their faith for it.  I understand what I'm working with, old man, don't ever question it.{x"
I let out a harsh sigh and start to tap my fingers impatiently on the hilt of my blade.  I don't have to explain myself-but I want to.  I want to hear myself, hear the assurance in my voice.  Know that I can keep doing this without breaking.  The Gods have to first, the Gods have to break first.
"{cYou're lying to yourself when you say you're doing this for all of us.  You want power and it's blinding you.{x"
"{yYou will never understand me, old man,{x" I swallow heavily and glance away, my hands sliding their gauntlets back on and quickly tightening the straps of my armor.  It's so much easier to run away from someone then to run away from yourself, maybe that's why I always seek these conversations--give them my all. 
"{yI am still a mortal.  I still have emotions and doubt.  I feel pain every day I do what I do--and yes, I want to stop; I want to bleed and give in; I want to fall to my knees and cry; I want to feel like a knight, like a person--not a slave.  And I can--but I won't.{x"
"{cNot for anything?{x"
I consider the question, answering myself in my mind before heading towards the stairs.
"{cWould you cease all of this for love, Cordani?{x"
My hands touch the tip of the railing though stay there for a moment, "{yIf {Yshe {yasked me to.{x"  With that I quickly make my way down back into the bustle of the Lords' Palace, hoping the noise could drown my thoughts.

It was a hot day at the Forge, Elzix Ghid, a hard working smith, 
decided that he should take a break, leaving the Forge behind for a 
few hours. He decided that the best way to rest was to look at his 
and his brother's treasures, hidden deep in the mountain.
 
   He left the Clan Hall and went to see his King, to ask him, if 
he could look at the treasures, because he was tired of working, 
and he needed something to distract him. The king nodded and 
called the guards. The guards escorted him to the hidden room where 
all the treasures of the dwarven nation were resting. He nodded to 
the guards and asked in his strong and rough voice, that he wished 
to be left alone inside, to admire the perfection of the jewelery, 
the beauty of the mithril shirts, the masterworking perfection on 
the dwarven axes, and the finesse of the long swords bearing the 
Artisans symbol.
 
 
   After quite some time, he realized that he had spent too much time 
admiring that beautiful treasure and he should be working. He called 
the guards to open him the door. They escorted him back to his king 
and he thank him with a lovely golden amulet, for the time he spent 
inside the treasure room.
 
   Well it was time to get back to work, Elzix, thanked once again to his

Several days had passed since the attack on his family estate. He had made contact with the
 man in black once again, this time to repay his promise of wealth. When the deal had been settled,
 Lorenthiel bid him well and left the Silver Dragon. Moving quietly through the streets of Palanthas
 he set out from the western gates, heading once more to the obscurity of Vingaard Forest.
 
      After a brief walk through the wood, assured that no one had followed him, Lorenthiel slips a
 shard of polished obsidian from his pouch. As he speaks the words to call the doorway, the stone
 flares brightly and vanishes as a dark {mrift{x formed like an archway rises from the forest floor. He
 pulls his robe tight around himself and steps through.
 
      The world swims back into view as he steps from the dark tear, gathering his mind a subtle gesture
 closes the {mrift{x behind him. Deep within the Silvanesti woods he now stands, the Than-Thalas roaring
 in echos from nearby and the thick canopy of the trees stretched overhead. His eyes search the horizon
 of the woodland, stopping at last as they trace the outline of a small hut hidden amongst the trees.
 If all is well, his contact should be waiting.
 
     Leaning gently against the door, he closes his eyes and listens intently. Three, maybe four...
 "Abomination, tell us your masters whereabouts and this will end quickly." the words are almost fluid,
 a delicate silvanesti accent masking the harshness of the common tongue. "If not, well..." the words
 trail off but seem to linger in the silence. They were here then, far quicker than he had planned. They 
 were here before he could ensure this ones silence himself. Cursing quietly, Lorenthiel slips back from
 door and makes a quick gesture with his hand, stepping into the air and lightly floating around the side
 of the small hut. As he alights upon the ground, he lifts his head slowly to glance inside the open air
 window.
 
      Three of the palace guard, tall and lithe their powerful build is enhanced by the chainmail robes
 that drape their forms. The one who spoke stands before the bound half elf assassin, his longsword in
 hand and resting on the wooden floor upon its tip. "An attack against a family is crime suited for death.
 The manner of that death falls very much to my discretion. Speak now and the crows will have something
 to pick at..." he speaks, voice calm and even. Spitting a mouthful of blood, the assassin rolls slowly
 to his side, looking up at the imposing figure through swollen eyes. A quiet chuckle, interupted by
 his wracking cough, as the half elf tries to grin. "Thats a poor bargain. You'll get not a word from me
 till you offer a better one." Shaking his head in disgust, the guard lifts his blade smoothly. With a
 flash of steel the bonds around the half elfs wrists drop away. "Speak now, or the next thing to be parted 
 will be your head and neck." The blade hovers inches from the assassins face. "Then we have a bargain?"
 the half elf asks quietly, his tone now serious and obviously intimidated. "His name, and you will be
 sent alive from these woods. Return and I shall end your offensive life myself." "Fine then...it was her
 son...." Laughing abruptly, the guard steps forward and sends a backhand across the half elfs face, a sharp
 blow that knocks him backwards. "Lies then? Her son was killed in the attack. Another and this ends." he
 steps back and nods to the other two guards. They bow slightly and move to the assassin, lurching him to
 his feet and securing his arms. The guard takes a few more idle paces, then turns and stares intently at
 the half elf. "It is the truth!" is the reply, the half elfs voice now shaking in fear. "It was her son
 who hired us, said he would make us wealthy for our efforts. I swear it!" The guards glare softens a bit
 as he turns to glance at another guard. "Describe him to me..." he states, lifting a brow and slowly
 moving towards the assassin. Lorenthiel snarls quietly, dropping back behind the wall silently. So much
 was coming apart, and if he were lapse any longer he may well find himself executed for his actions.
 
     A resounding peal of thunder breaks out, the guards reacting instantly with drawn blades. The rumble
 of thunder rolls across the heavens above, as a few small raindrops are seen through the window. The head
 of the detachment steps forward cautiously, moving to the window and slowly scanning the sky. Another peal
 of thunder booms across the forest, this time closer and even louder than the first. Alarmed, the guard
 turns and motions to the door quickly. The two guards releases the assassin and comply, the first lifting
 his spear and nodding, the second throwing the door open quickly and flashing a longsword from its sheath
 smoothly. The door slams against the inner walls, as the two guards lurch forward. Bursting from the hut
 they quickly turn opposite one another and scan the woodlands. Nothing, save the thick stormclouds now
 gathering over the woods. A spiderweb of lightning dances across a roiling bank of stormclouds, flashing 
 brightly. A half elf steps suddenly from the wood, midnight coloured robes flowing gently in the winds
 of the storm. His thin fingers encircle a black ashen staff of volcanic glass, which he carries gently
 in both hands. Suprised by the sudden appearance, the guards react a moment too late as Lorenthiel lifts
the staff towards them....

and speaks the word of command. The staff glows a dull {rred{x as a column of {rvolcanic flame{x tears upward
 from the forest floor, engulfing the guards in a tower of smouldering ash. The glow fades from the staff,
 and Lorenthiel raises his hand toward the entrance to the tiny hut. As he chants the words of the spell,
 Lorenthiel spreads his fingers wide apart. A wave of {rflame{x is called into existance, seeming to flow 
 out from the sorcerer towards the hut. In a moment the entire hut is engulfed, the walls already blackened
 and cracking from the fire. Lorenthiel lowers his hand, placing the end of the staff against the ground
 and waiting patiently. A moment passes, then from the cloud of smoke steps the head of the guard, the
 assassin in tow, coughing deeply from the smoke. The guard snarls and throws the half elf to the ground,
 bringing his sword to up to point at the half elf standing before him. Catching sight of the two guards
 burning away under the column of flame; the guard snarls and moves toward Lorenthiel. "I will kill you
 myself half breed." he growls, sure now that this is the one he was seeking. The half elf smirks and lifts
 the staff once more. Grinning, Lorenthiel speaks the word of command as the staff resumes its {rcrimson{x

 full brunt of the blast. Lunging forward his sword connects, driving deep into the half elfs left shoulder.
 Lorenthiel cries out, dropping the glass staff and clutching at the guards arm. The guard twists the blade
 sharply as Lorenthiel tries to cast a spell, causing his concentration to lapse and the charge building
 in his other hand to disperse. The two strugle, the half elf suprisingly strong for his build but the
 royal guard the stronger still. A swift kick to Lorenthiels knee drops the sorcerer to thre ground, the
 guard maintaining his hold on the blade and pressing downward as he falls. The sorcerer gasps as the air
 is knocked from his lungs, struggling to recapture his breath. Speaking in silvanesti, the guard sneers
 down at the wounded half elf, "And to think I expected one worth my time..." he laughs hollowly, once more
 turning the blade slightly in the wound. His sharp smile is broken as a look of disbelief passes over his
 features. His grip slips from his sword, reaching to clutch at his own back as he turns. Falling to his
 knees, Lorenthiel sees a short sword plunged into the mans back the assassin who placed it there grinning
 through bloodied lips. The guard falls forward, a dark stain spreading across the back of his armor.
 
     Lorenthiel stands, falling to his side once more as he pulls the sword free. The assassin splits into
 three images, swirling around before converging back into one, his hand outstretched to help Lorenthiel to
 feet. Accepting, the half elf rises and presses hard upon the wound, trying to stanch to flow of blood.
 "Looked like you needed some help." the assassin speaks softly, drawing the sword from the mans back and
 wiping it in the tall grasses. Lorenthiel nods, bowing slightly to show his appreciation. The assassin
 nods and turns to scan the woods, sure that more of the guards are nearby. "I knew you would be here," he
 calls over a shoulder, "I knew you wouldn't try to leave without finishing our buisness." he speaks in a
 slightly smug voice. "Oh, of course not...." Lorenthiel replies darkly, lifting his staff from the forest
 floor to point at the assassins back. "I always see my buisness finished."

-A tired man, well into his mid-sixties, rests upon a dry patch of grass by the roadside-
 
 
       He stretches his thin fingers once more over the gnarled wood of the staff, tracing the marks
 left by his travels and muttering softly. The sun dips low over the horizon, the Garnet Mountains
 thrown into sharp relief by the fading sun. The coolness of night begins to settle in as the man draws
 his worn cloak tighter.
 
       As he begins to nod off, the fire he had warmed himself by now nothing but embers, a soft snap
 of a dry twig stirs him slightly. He turns his head toward the noise and catches sight of the red
 robes he has seen so many times before. His leathery face breaks into a warm smile as he inclines his
 head slightly and gestures to the makeshift camp. His guest nods gently, his features still concealed
 within the hood of his robe. He takes a seat opposite the once scholar, dropping his hood back with a
 calm sweep of his hand. "{rMaster Garein, you honor me with your visit.{x" Talin speaks softly.
 
      "{rThe sun rises my friend, and so illuminates new paths for me to walk.{x" Talin speaks, seeming
 to be re-energized by the prospect. He gathers himself, grinning even as he winces from the creakings
 in his back. "{rSo may Sirrion illuminate the path -you- tread my friend.{x" he adds, bowing as much as
 his worn frame would allow. Smiling, Nuantho rises and returns the gesture. "{rGood luck my friend.{x"
 Nodding once more, Talin turns and begins his new journey, the gnarled staff softly marking the passage
 of each step. Nuantho watches the man leave for a moment, then with a softly spoken word is gone.

To the Towers of High Sorcery,
My name is Stilanthralis Moonwater of Qualinost, a Wizard of High Sorcery who passed the Test nigh over 200 years ago.
I am writing to recommend my daughter Cloreana to take the Test.. she has been my apprentice for years now.. and beyond surpassing even my abilities.. her desire for the secrets of the Towers' libraries burns brighter then any flame or moonlight.
I feel she is ready.. and though I fear her stubborness may attract Lunitari's attention, I find that is a decision best left up to the moons.
Both I and her await your reply,
Stilanthralis Moonwater

It was a long hard day work at the Forge, Elzix Ghid, wondered, 
where were the dwellers or the noise of pickaxes echoing through 
the tunnels and the reberberation on the halls. He knew times 
were diferent, alot diferent than the glorious days when the halls 
were crawling with all sorts of dwarfs, working hard to the same goal...
 
   After some deep though on the matter, he decided to take his anxieties 
to the King. The king was resting on his chambers, but since they knew 
each other well enough, Elzix was allowed to enter the royal chambers. 
They discussed several matters and this particular one that was troubling 
Elzix's mind. The King agreed that something was amiss. After some 
deep though about it, both agreed that must be because they weren't giving 
the correct atention to their God Reorx. Elzix offered himself to organize 
a huge festivity in favour of their God Reorx, in order to bring them joy 
and good fortune. He also requested that a small portion of the royal 
treasure should cover the festivity's costs, since the Artisans were low 
on foundings.
 
   All details being set, Elzix left the King's presence and rushed into his 
Clan hall to work on the organization of the festivity. Requesting the aid 
of the royal runners, he send word to each dwarven clan in the city and he 
also sent word to the major taverns in the outter world.
 
   The clock was ticking and there was not a second to waste, all must 
be prepared before the day of the festivity.

Easeful the forest, easeful its mansions perfected
Where we grow and decay no long, our tree ever green,
Ripe fruit never fallin, streams still and transparent
As glass, as the heart in repose this lasting day.

Beneath these brancehs the willing surrender movement,
The business of birdsong, of love, left on the borders
With all of the fevers, the failures of memory.
Easeful the forest, easeful its mansions perfected.
 
And light upon liht, light as dismissal of darkness,
Beneath these brances no shade, for shade is forgotten
In the warmth of the the light and the cool smell of the leaves
Where we grow and decay; no longer, our trees ever green.
 
Here there is quiet, where music turns in upon silence,
here at the world's imagined edge, where clarity
Completes the senses, at long last where we behold
Ripe fruit never falling, streams still and transparent.
 
Where the tears are dried from our faces, or settle
Still as a stream in accomplished countries of peace,
And the traveler opens, permitting the voyage of light
As air, as the heart in repose this lasting day.
 
Easeful the forest, easeful its mansions perfected
Where we grow and decay no longer, our trees ever green,
Ripe fruit never falling, streams still and transparent
As glass, as the heart in repose this lasting day.

Broken was how she was born, and broken was what she forever would be. The wooden planks beneath her soft cheek gave her no comfort in their splintery kiss, her pale robes, once a good representation of everything she wished to become now only showing the world what she had been turned to by no choice of her own.
 
Every name she had ever been called, every cold glance, every brush off now played through her twirling thoughts as she vainly tried to push herself away from the loving ground, but such efforts were wasted for this would be her final rest.
 
She'd survived her nightmare filled childhood of sickness and hatred, survived the remarks, the scorn she received upon her "recovery," and stumbled her way through her unofficial exhilement despite her having turned not to the dark gods.
 
She'd left everyone she'd ever cared for or loved behind just so they would be happy, they no longer having to be seen alongside one who had come, according to them, under some foul curse of the dark gods; and so she came to Palanthas, seeking sanctuary in the one thing that had never failed her.
 
Frail fingers clenched, their hold against one another weakened and barely felt, the effort sending a violent tremble through her frail arms as tears came to sting at her eyes. She was alone, as always, left alone in her final hour to fade away with evenings light. Brilliant blue eyes closed slowly on the world, her tears flowing seemingly freely now as her strength began to ebb, her world shrinking in upon itself as her thoughts began to slowly slip from her clinging grasp..
 
"Silent one," "Speechless apprentice," and all the long winded insults and foul stares she'd ever received for her silence flooded back to her thoughts, threatening to spill over the darkness which was attempting to claim her.
 
She was a mute, it was true, but she'd been blessed in that her magic had not been taken until she'd turned from Solinari in the end. He'd promised her when she was young, that her gift would not be wasted, that while she'd be unable to whisper even a breath her voice in magic wouldn't be quieted by her physical ailment. There was no crutch in his gift, no burst of godly strength, simply the promise that her magic would not wither and die within her
 
Such thoughts began to fade now, only the sound of her own shallow breathing reaching her ears. What little light that was offered from the setting sun was failing now, its warmth trickling from her porcelain skin as it sank beneath the treetops and houses which surrounded her, the shadows spilling into the back alleyway to drown her away in their cold as her last breath came and all was stilll..

Diary of an orphan assassin
A small dust covered book reveals itself as you look over the shelves of

nature.  Your curiosity finally gets the better of you.  Taking a deep
breath, preparing yourself for what is obviously a gnomish story, you
finally brush the dust off and open the book.  My name is Neoa, the acronym
for the name is not important, nore is the name any more.  You know, my
family always said if you are ever in trouble, simply surrender.  Everything
will work out better that way.  The people attacking you, or trying to take
over your land will get information, and eventually you will get a good bit
of knowledge out of the situation.  Failing that, you probably will get the
information you want to know eventually.  After all they dont consider you a
threat, so, after a while, what can it hurt.  My family, if they were alive
today would not be proud to here me write these next words.  They were
wrong.  All through my life I knew I was different.  I was bigger to name
one of quite a few differences.  The good news is, I suppose it does not
matter any more.  Soon I shall escape from here, or die trying.  This
mountain is quite different from where I grew up.  It is colder, darker, and
there are no explosions to keep me asleep.  It is much two quiet.  I have
finished painting the portrait, to the best of my memory, of my family.  It,
along with the weapons, and few devices I have invented will be the only
things that I shall take with me.  When I need strength to do what I need to
do, I will look at the painting of my family, I will draw strength from
there death and not allow it to consume me.  Soon the ones that killed my
family will pay.  They will pay for slaying them in cold blood right in
front of me.  They will pay for imprisoning me.  They will pay for not
believing me when I repeatedly told them the mission my family was on while
we were in that city of what I now realize must contain the vary essence of
evil and hatred itself.  Yes, all of them will pay for taking my life that I
loved so well from me.  But first.  I grow weary of speaking this tongue of
dwarves.  And most of all.  I grow weary of not being free.  First I must
get rid of a slight problem I have with a family of dwarves.  Then my

The lithe body dexstrously bounded through the trees of Vingaard with speed short of haste and just faster then pure glee. The myriad of colored feathers caught the light of his gleaming silver jewelry with each leap of his supple legs. Despite his appearence of reckless speed, not a sound was made aside from the woodland creatures calling out like sentries of the sylvan scenery.
The Kagonesti had been running as the sun first spread its life giving rays like so many fingers through the leaves, branchs and clouds, and it was not until both Lunitari and Solinari had risen and the bottom rim of the sun had disappeared below the horizon that he stopped near a stream to pray and refresh.
Removing the deerskin moccasins worn on his feet, the short loincloth used for propriety and his plethora of silver jewelry decorated with beads and the feathers of a thousand still living birds, the elf plunged headfirst into the frigid waters, gently scraping his chest and legs against the rocks of the riverbed.
Swimming submerged, the kagonesti silently prayed to Habbakuk for sustenance and, whether the Fisher King had heard or not, Sikandar saw through the fluid realm a large trout, dying slowly and painfully from the bite of some larger aquarian predator. With a swift grab and a prayer of gratitude to Habbakuk, Sikandar rose to the surface of the stream with the barely struggling fish in his left hand.
Pulling his sun-bronzed body that bore no traces of a tanline from the water, Sikandar walked slowly but gently to his trinkets and gently placed the fish on a log. He gathered firewood as he sang an old tribal song his mother had taught him and as the sun finally settled behind him, he had started a small fire and cooked his meal.
Satiated, Sikandar put on his deerskin and silver, plunged his head into the crystal stream and drank long and eagerly. Checking he had his daggers, he set off Eastward once more, his keen elven sight and deceptive kagonesti muscles carrying him swiftly towards Palanthas.
As he broke through the woods, the anxiety in his gut became tangible and he stopped to stare at the metropolis that was Palanthas. It had been some years since he had last left the cities behind to their own selfish and petty bickerings. Now he felt it time to return.. or rather the whispers of Habbakuk's children had convinced them it was a man in Palanthas who could help him find his sister.. if she still lived.

The Palanthian guards had given him confused looks as he entered, but no attempt was made to stop him for questioning. Either things in the city had become more peaceful, or the Solamnics had more dangerous things to worry about. Sticking to the sidestreets and alleys, Sikandar wound his way towards the center of Palanthas - towards the Temple of Paladine.
Moments after his arrival he paused behind the corner of a buidling to wretch violently. The stench of the city was oppressive, the animals within little more then slaves or toys for their self-centered masters and the multitudes of souls seemed to have forgotten they had one. His stomach empty, Sikandar finished the mile or so to the city on uneasy legs, the hard, unyielding cobblestones providing little comfort for his weary legs.
The square before the Temple of Paladine was sparcely populated, and Sikandar took note of the population here compared to the rest of the city. As his gaze reached from face to face it fell definetly on that of a large man in blackened armor. At once he realized why much of the Palanthian citizenry avoided the temple.. it had once again become (or never ceased to be?) a favorite spot of the Knights of Takhisis. 
How the population of Solamnics tolerated their presence so easily Sikandar could not guess, but as he approached the temple avoiding the Knights gaze, Sikandar caught his notice and was confronted before moving on.
"{DYou must know that I am here with a message for the Palanthian citizenry, one of death{x" the knight thundered with his hand on his weapon.
Sikandar replied in his broken Common: "{bI am no citizen of this city.. citizen of NO city.. I am Kagonesti you lapdog of Takhisis{x" he regretted his words as he had said them, but common came from his mouth.. as if he had no choice of the words.
The knight glared down at Sikandar, his eyes gleaming behind his dark helm: "{DIt matters little, but I would have you leave now if as you claim is true and you are not of this ci{x-"
The knight was interrupted as the cry of an elf maiden came across the square: "{BSikandar! Sikandar it is I, Serpintina! Where have you been for so long?{x"
Though his face was covered, Sikandar could see the knight raise his eyebrow from behind his helm and chuckle slightly. "{DNot from here eh? Well that incorrigible flirt Serpintina seems to recognize you, SIKANDAR.{x"
The beautiful magi walked quickly up and almost instantly recognized the situation. By now a small audience was paying attention from the periphery and an heated exchange began that seamlessly broke into elven, and quickly after that, violence seemed imminent.
Serpintina was attacked and Sikandar rushed to her aid. The blessings of the Dark Goddess proved strong and both elves hit the cobblestones hard. The Kagonesti awoke some time later with figures standing above him. "It is just like Palanthas for an occurance such as this to merit no alarm and only mild amusement," Sikandar thought as he looked frantically for Serpintina's corpse. He found her, still breathing but barely, and feebly pulled her close to the fountain to awaken her.
As her eyes fluttered open, Serpintina looked around quickly and in alarm: "{BWhere did that bastard go!?{x" Sikandar cupped another handful of water into her mouth and smiled, then reached behind him and pulled out a small black money purse with the symbol of the Knights of Takhisis on it.
In elven Sikandar spoke: "{bHe is gone Lady, though not with everything he came here with.. or for.{x" The magi looked at him slightly then understood with a smile that warmed Sikandar like little in a city could. "{bIt would be better for them if in the future these squires of Takhisis would learn to check their pockets as well as the pulse of their victims.{x" 
He smiled and winked at Serpintina then helped her to her feet. "{bCome!{x" he said weakly through teeth clenched in pain, "{bDinner is on Takhisis{x!"

|                                                            |
|   As we all can easily figure out, even with our modest    |
| intelligence, feudal laws and the political structure of   |
| of Solamnia has greatly changed over the ages. It is, in   |
| fact, proven.                                              |
|   We could define the "First Age" of Solamnia as the age   |
| under the Empire of Ergoth: Solamnia was a frontier land,  |
| too distant from the Imperial Palaces of Daltigoth to be   |
| well goverened. The various feudal lords complained about  |
| the heavy taxation which impared the growth of local       |
| economy and sometimes caused famine. The Imperial Prefects,|
| whose authority was was superior to that of the local land-|
| lords, were very rigid and admitted no delay in the payment|
  | of taxes. It wasn't rare that the feudal lords and their   |
| populations were unable to pay them. Failure to do so,     |
| however, caused the alienation of the feud, from which     |
| returned to the direct control of the Emperor.             |
|   Many fallen nobles united with their cousins who were    |
| still in control of their lands, and under the flag of     |
| Count Mytrandar, the eastermost counties rebelled to       |
| against the central power of Emperor Thenkalin III, whose  |
| dynasty took the throne after the death of the just Emporer|
| Quevalin XXv, last of the most revered Quevalin line. But, |
| in the year 1850, after many deaths and a cruel repression,|
| the Imperial authority was restored, and the five Counts   |
| were executed or killed in battle.                         |
|   After a few years, when the taxes had risen once more,   |
| the wrath of another revolt had been incurred as the pop-  |
| ulation was stricken by another famine. The reamining      |
| Counts of the East embraced this new revolt, called "the   |
  | Rose Rebellion," after the red rose of the blazon from the |
  | crest of Count DiCaela, who was the leader of the uprise.  |
| So generalized was the revolt, that after a few defeats,   |
| the Imperial Marshal, Grand-Duke Alyusandrus of Foghaven,  |
| deemed it necessary to order the elite troops of the       |
  | Imperial Guard into battle. These elite troops were led by |
| a young and talented commander, General Vinas Solamnus,    |
| third son of the House of Vinasserre.                      |

|   Lesson One (cont.)                                       |
|                                                            |
|   And so, the war began during the winter. The flags of the|
| Kingfisher, and banner of Vinas Solamnus blanketed the     |
| Eastern counties and the Imperial Palace Guards faced the  |
| guerrilla of the rebels in the lands of Vingaard. The      |
| guerrilla of the rebels suffered some, and won only one    |
| battle. It was on the Glade of Jansburg that General       |
| Solamnus captured two of the Rebel Leaders. The son of     |
| Count William DiCaela, and Sir Gerald, the old and virtuous|
| Count of Jansburg. Just the year before, the Count of      |
| Jansburg had abdicated to his son. After that, he donned   |
| white tunic, bearing the crest of the Priest of Paladine.  |
|   After that battle, General Solamnus advanced and besieged|
| Vingaard. It was here, at the beginning of spring, that the|
| last Count of Vingaard (Lord Harris) died in battle.       |
| Vingaard was taken at the price of so many lives. General  |
  | Solamnus, who, during the seige, enjoyed the company of two|
| captives, was greived by the cost of his victory. His      |
| conviction and faith in the Empire was rapidly failing, and|
| after the Year of Waiting, in which he occupied Vingaard   |
| without any offensive action, was the time from which he   |
| decided to join the revolt. But not until after much inner |
| struggle and meditation. On that cold winter morning,      |
| General Vinas Solamnus spoke to his troops, and his tears  |
| froze on his stern and noble face. He offered his soldiers |
| the choice. Join the revolt, or return home. Very few      |
| returned to Daltigoth.                                     |
|   General Solamnus battle against the decadant Ergothian   |
| Empire for two solid years after that. This war was called |
| "the War of the Ice Tears," and was eventually won. Vinas  |
| Solamnus entered Daltigoth after the war and accepted it in|
| a manner befitting that of a Conquering Hero, to accept the|
| Emperor's embarrassed surrender.                           |
  |   All of the Eastern Counties of the Rose Rebellion, as    |
| well as the Northern Wastes and many other minor lands,    |
| swore fealty to him that day. Thus making him the King of a|
| new-born state, Solamnia.                                  |

|   Solamnus was not a power-hungry man, and he had no heirs.|
| And it was after this revelation that he went on a pilgri- |
| mage, a Quest of Honour. He asked the Gods for wisdom and  |
| guidance, for he well knew that the shadow of violence and |
| misery would return to the land he had freed after he had  |
| lain to the eternal rest. And it was on this Quest that the|
| Gods spoke to him. They intructed him in the creation of a |
| Knightly Order, the Knights of Solamnia.                   |
|   After the Kings Quest of Honour, he returned home and    |
| gave life to three Knightly Orders. At the time, every     |
| ranking member within these new Orders (having been his    |;| long standing and loyal military officers) received the    |
| charge to be the feudal government of a territory. Each    |
| with it's own degree of importance. Simple villages were   |
| held by simple Noblemen or Patrices, groups of towns by    |
| Barons. And finally, the larger territories were held by   |
  | Counts, Marquises, and Dukes.                              |
|   Some of these dukedoms, which contained historical places|
| or key-point fortresses were held by Princes. These Princes|
| were always the greatest of Heroes from the War of the Ice |
| Tears, like the Lord of Justice, Lord Angus Markennin - the|
| first Prince of Thelgaard. It was by this process of infeu-|
| dation that the whole of Solamnia had been divided into the|
| Provinces of today. Each one governed by a King with       |
| with authority extended to "lesser" feudataries (the       |;| Princes, Dukes, Marquises, Counts and Barons). Every land- |
| lord, regardless of title, can have, as valvassors, Noble- |
| men of Patrice rank, who rule one or more little villages  |
| and one castle or keep.                                    |
|   After this impressive and grand-scale reform (henceforth |;| called "the Feudal Reform"), the Council of the Knighthood |
| was established. From that time forth, as the higher autho-|
| rity to which every landlord, even Kings, had to pay       |
| obedience, and his permanent head was "the Grand Master."  |
  |   The Grand Master of the Knights of Solamnia who, as Lord |
| of Knights, holds the supreme and permanent power (both    |;| militarily and civil) over all the Kingdoms and lesser     |
| feudal states. The Grand Master is elected by the Grand    |
| Council of the Knights of Solamnia, so the supreme author- |
| ity is not hereditary like any other political position.   |
| Futhermore, the Feudataries are not automatically elected. |
| Why? Simply because they must be a ranking Knight from one |
| of the Three Orders.                                       |

After many nights spent in Neraka, deep in both thought, and prayer, I knew what I had to do.. I lead myself to the Stronghold, to the temple, to find just who I needed, Lord Razel. He was there, kneeling before the altar, with his head bowed, a soft mutter leaving his lips, prayers. I simply stood at the entrance, knowing what needed to be said, my mind strong.. guided.
 
"{DLord Razel..{x" I said, the words leaving my lips calmly and quietly; my head still lowered a bit, as I spoke, out of respect for the temple. I slowly lifted my head, and straightened myself, to face Razel fully, and crossed my arms; deeming it necessary. "{DWe need to speak..{x" I forced myself to add, only to specify his reaction more to my liking.
 
Razel unexpectedly stops at the first sound of my voice, though finishes his quiet prayer before slowly rising, and still facing the altar, he bows to it, a gesture of reverence, supposedly, before he faces me. "{DYes, my Lord..?{x" He says, the words evenly spoken, with a humble tone.
 
I exhaled slowly, even deeply, to see the reaction of Razel, to try to show an emotion, even if grief. "{DI have put much thought into this decision,{x" I said, my expression hardening a bit before I continued, "{Dand I have done much planning, to find a solution to any possible problem that could arise..{x" Stating quite plainly, I hoped for a more.. positive reaction.. though I still expected a harsh one.
 
Showing no facial expression, Razel nods slowly, the only response vague, with his eyes staring blankly into mine, as if in thought, of anything.. contemplation, or otherwise.
 
I nodded once, leveled, and measured perfectly, graceful even, as far as a nod goes. Though the odd expression of my own, even if hardly visible, unchanging. "{DI will be stepping down, as Lord of Night, Lord Razel..{x" Razel's interest seemingly perked with such simple words, though he chose to hide it. "{DThe position will be passed down to you; and I will be posted in Neraka.. the Queen wishes for me to revive her armies..{x" I said surely, my tone quite smooth, and convincing.
 
Taking a while for a descent response to formulate, Razel appeared to be quite confused, "{DLord?{x" He asked respectfully, though I'm sure he meant pardon, for lack of better words.. "{DThis is very.. unexpected...{x" Pausing for a few moments before a smile begins to work its way upon his face. "{DI will work with you in any, -any- way you want; and the Queen will flourish above all else.{x" He said, apparently, concealing as much enthusiasm as he could.
 
A slight, involuntary smile of my own began to form on my lips, and I began to nod, as expected. "{DShe shall..{x" The words left my lips slowly, before I continued, "{DI know that you have potential, Lord Razel, which is why I expect everything. Lead well, Razel, and show your might to the Queen.{x" I stated firmly, my eyes carefully drifting to the corner of the room; I could've sworn I felt a presence.
 
"{DExpect several visits from me, Lord.{x" Razel says, his smile broadening, as he extends his hand towards me. "{DIts been a pleasure serving under you, Lord Roivas.{x"
 
Hardly hearing his words, I began to focus on the corner of the temple, and the shadows that shrouded it. I had lost my sense of reality. I knew something was there. I felt it.
 
Seemingly out of the shadows in the corner of which I was focused, a beautiful woman with pale skin and long black hair slowly faded into existence, my eyes slowly widening with each moment, and my expression falling blank.
 
The pale skinned beauty swished her long black hair, and it fell seductively about her face.. I'll never forget the sight.. as she slowly, and gracefully made her way towards the both of us.
 
Razel's hand dropped immediately as my expression was noticed, and he to turned himself around slightly, to cock his head to the side and find what I was seeing himself, though as his eyes fell upon her, his head dropped instantly in reverence.
 
Making her way intricately towards us, she stops in between us both, at which point, my head finally drops, in the near presence of the woman. Paying no mind to me, she turned directly to Razel, and bent over, placing a gentle finger beneath his chin.. Oh, how I envied him.. as she slowly lifted his head, her voice so perfectly lustful, as she whispered "{bStand..{x"
 
Razel, shaking lightly at her touch, even, forces himself to lift his head, and straighten himself; though he is unable to look her in the eye, for whatever reason, his trembling proceeding to worsen as he stands.
 
The pale skinned woman slowly stands straight up, and turns to me, yet my head remained lowered.. I felt like it needed to be, so that I couldn't see her face, instead, my eyes were fixed upon her chest. She then took me with both hands, by my hips, and pulls herself in, close to me, leaned in a bit, and lowered her head; to place her chin just below my shoulder.
She then inhaled deeply.. so deeply.. as she ran her nose, which was lightly pressed against my shoulder, along my neck, and up the side of my face, until it reached my ear.
 
I kept my head lowered.. faced with a combination of honor, awe, and nervousness as she acted. Choosing to simply await further action, I held my stance, firmly, though couldn't help but to bite my bottom lip out of anxiousness..

Her lips almost seemed to nibble at my ear and her whisper sounding like quiet music.. "{bYou have chosen the path which I have always planned for you, the knights will be left for Razel; and you will find glory in Neraka.. I have watched you walk longingly in that place and I bless your path.{x" I simply stood, words unable to reach my lips..
 
She pushed herself away from me after a few silent moments, to turn and face Razel once more. She looked back her and offered me a smile.. which I hardly noticed.. still awestruck.. before she whipped her head around to look at Razel, and she beckoned him towards her single, tempting finger.
 
Razel took the few steps required to close the space between him and the woman, though he does it so quickly.. with such desire.. it would seem as if she drew him near her..
 
The pale woman spoke to Razel, though her voice still quiet, "{bYou will continue to lead my Knights; as Roivas has said, though until the ranks of the Lily swell, there shall be no Lord of Night, no one needs the role, at this point in time..{x" She tilted her head to the side, a playful expression haunting her now. "{bDo you understand my wishes..?{x"
 
"{DI do, my Queen.{x" Razel said, a humble tone finding its way to his voice, as he speaks, then lowering his head, he stands, his entire body still shaking slightly in her presence.

She smiled, before twisting herself around, to face me once more. "{bAre you now ready to continue your path..?{x" She asked, a strange, indescribable tone to her voice.
 
I only nodded once, though it was very firmly. "{DI've always been ready, my Queen.{x" I stated, yet sadly, it was too plain for my liking.
 
She tilts her head to the side once more, her seductive smile growing. "{bI look forward to seeing the shadows of Neraka stirring again..{x" She said quietly, before turning around, and heading for the shadows that she appeared from, a gentle hand placed on Razel's shoulder as she walks by; directly into the shadows disappearing with that, leaving the room silent.

After many nights spent in Neraka, deep in both thought, and prayer, I knew what I had to do.. I lead myself to the Stronghold, to the temple, to find just who I needed, Lord Razel. He was there, kneeling before the altar, with his head bowed, a soft mutter leaving his lips, prayers. I simply stood at the entrance, knowing what needed to be said, my mind strong.. guided.
 
"{DLord Razel..{x" I said, the words leaving my lips calmly and quietly; my head still lowered a bit, as I spoke, out of respect for the temple. I slowly lifted my head, and straightened myself, to face Razel fully, and crossed my arms; deeming it necessary. "{DWe need to speak..{x" I forced myself to add, only to specify his reaction more to my liking.
 
Razel unexpectedly stops at the first sound of my voice, though finishes his quiet prayer before slowly rising, and still facing the altar, he bows to it, a gesture of reverence, supposedly, before he faces me. "{DYes, my Lord..?{x" He says, the words evenly spoken, with a humble tone.
 
I exhaled slowly, even deeply, to see the reaction of Razel, to try to show an emotion, even if grief. "{DI have put much thought into this decision,{x" I said, my expression hardening a bit before I continued, "{Dand I have done much planning, to find a solution to any possible problem that could arise..{x" Stating quite plainly, I hoped for a more.. positive reaction.. though I still expected a harsh one.

Her lips almost seemed to nibble at my ear and her whisper sounding like quiet music.. "{bYou have chosen the path which I have always planned for you, the knights will be left for Razel; and you will find glory in Neraka.. I have watched you walk longingly in that place and I bless your path.{x" I simply stood, words unable to reach my lips..
 
She pushed herself away from me after a few silent moments, to turn and face Razel once more. She looked back her and offered me a smile.. which I hardly noticed.. still awestruck.. before she whipped her head around to look at Razel, and she beckoned him towards her single, tempting finger.
 
Razel took the few steps required to close the space between him and the woman, though he does it so quickly.. with such desire.. it would seem as if she drew him near her..
 
The pale woman spoke to Razel, though her voice still quiet, "{bYou will continue to lead my Knights; as Roivas has said, though until the ranks of the Lily swell, there shall be no Lord of Night, no one needs the role, at this point in time..{x" She tilted her head to the side, a playful expression haunting her now.

"{bI look forward to seeing the shadows of Neraka stirring again..{x" She said quietly, before turning around, and heading for the shadows that she appeared from, a gentle hand placed on Razel's shoulder as she walks by; directly into the shadows disappearing with that, leaving the room silent.

Word spreads about the order of the recent intrusions into the private sections of  
the great library.  A holy order Knight whom is believed to be called Relik duped our
guardians into believing he had permission and came on behest of Oromis - leader of the
holy order.  It wasn't till he was seen coping notes from an ancient tomb in the private
section of the library that guards got suspect of him and asked him to leave, which he
was more than happy to do his notes in hand.

This one event may have not caused alarm but for the most recent of intrusion which
involved injury to a guard.  A magic user believed to be an Undead Lord! intruded into
the same section.  He was fended off but he escaped with one our ancient tombs, and
worst of all, the tomb was the same one which Relik was caught copying from.  It is one
of our older artifacts and is the works of Jezulah Elro, titled {D'Dark Weaponry of the Ages.'{X

Vivienne: She Would Die Alone
Sat Jun 23 01:31:50 2007
To: Conclave Roman
Broken was how she was born, and broken was what she forever would be. The wooden planks beneath her soft cheek gave her no comfort in their splintery kiss, her pale robes, once a good representation of everything she wished to become now only showing the world what she had been turned to by no choice of her own.
 
Every name she had ever been called, every cold glance, every brush off now played through her twirling thoughts as she vainly tried to push herself away from the loving ground, but such efforts were wasted for this would be her final rest.
 
She'd survived her nightmare filled childhood of sickness and hatred, survived the remarks, the scorn she received upon her "recovery," and stumbled her way through her unofficial exhilement despite her having turned not to the dark gods.
 
She'd left everyone she'd ever cared for or loved behind just so they would be happy, they no longer having to be seen alongside one who had come, according to them, under some foul curse of the dark gods; and so she came to Palanthas, seeking sanctuary in the one thing that had never failed her.
 
Frail fingers clenched, their hold against one another weakened and barely felt, the effort sending a violent tremble through her frail arms as tears came to sting at her eyes. She was alone, as always, left alone in her final hour to fade away with evenings light. Brilliant blue eyes closed slowly on the world, her tears flowing seemingly freely now as her strength began to ebb, her world shrinking in upon itself as her thoughts began to slowly slip from her clinging grasp..
 
"Silent one," "Speechless apprentice," and all the long winded insults and foul stares she'd ever received for her silence flooded back to her thoughts, threatening to spill over the darkness which was attempting to claim her.
 
She was a mute, it was true, but she'd been blessed in that her magic had not been taken until she'd turned from Solinari in the end. He'd promised her when she was young, that her gift would not be wasted, that while she'd be unable to whisper even a breath her voice in magic wouldn't be quieted by her physical ailment. There was no crutch in his gift, no burst of godly strength, simply the promise that her magic would not wither and die within her
 
Such thoughts began to fade now, only the sound of her own shallow breathing reaching her ears. What little light that was offered from the setting sun was failing now, its warmth trickling from her porcelain skin as it sank beneath the treetops and houses which surrounded her, the shadows spilling into the back alleyway to drown her away in their cold as her last breath came and all was stilll..
 
 
 
 
(OOC: I left this short. No one really bothered all that much to know Vivienne, and so I won't tell you all what you don't wish to know. :P I'd like to thank though, Yerthorn, Dietrich, and Roman (who this story will be forwarded to also since he took the time to roleplay with Vivienne and isn't in this clan I don't think) for making my time here fun (both ICly and OOCly), and giving me an actual reason to log on in the hopes of getting some roleplay.
 
It's been fun, but with the death of my character and countless hours logged in with me doing nothing but sitting - I don't really think I'm cut out for MUD roleplaying, so no hard feelings. Farewell and I apologize for the OOC at the end of this story)

shiny.  No, today was a grey day.  The weather was slightly cold, but even
a strong willed child could endure it.  A slight breeze came in from the
south on the city of Palanthas.
 
Riding in from the south, breeze blowing to his back and cloak gusting in
the wind was Archimaad.  He rode upon a skeletal horse up the path towards
the white city.  His mind was set in determination as he gripped the reigns
of the skeletal horse he rode.  'Get Nilat,' Archimaad thought, 'And I will
proove myself as Aeleth's most devoted warrior.'
 
As he neared the south city gates, the guards on the defended walls began
to stir and shout.  The rushed to close the gate, but were too late.  The
skeletal horse prooved its unearthly speed, graced by the magic of undeath.
One foolish guard at the base inside of the gates tried rush in and stop
Archimaad.  The guard drew sword and shield and yelled, "Halt, fiend!  You
will not inva-..," it ended there.  Archimaad had taken up lance and impaled
it on the head of the guard.  Archimaad kept moving with no incident as the
head slid off of the lance and rolled to the side of the road.
 
By this point the citizens of the city were in alarm, or at the vert least
confused.  Those who frighten easily ran home to bar their windows at the
sight of an undead.  Those who could claim to have stomachs were baffled
because of the fact it truly was just an undead.  Archimaad didn't stop to
impress, or rather terrify.  He had a goal in mind, one that would make him
great in the eyes of his God.
 
He rushed to the end of the High Knight's Road and past the Central Plaza.
He had made it to Temple Row and could see Paladine's temple in sight.  The
presence of it lowered his moral, but no more.  After all, he was no undead
yet.  The usual crowd at the hour of the day began to scatter as people would
cry, "Undead!"  This made things a whole lot easier for Archimaad.  He eased
his horse into the temple square.  He pulled on the reigns of his horse and
it came to a stop.  He scanned the crowd and saw who he was looking for; the
holy man, Relik.  He had Nilat, and he would get it from him...

It was an akward sight; a man that advocated such evil in a crowd of those
who followed the light.  People immediatly began to gather, ready to fight
against the common threat.  That was the one thing that kept them strong
against Archimaad.  Seperated and he could rip any one of the limb from limb.
Together, and they could overwhelm him in a matter of time.
 
Archimaad leveled his lance at Relik and cried out, "Relik of the Holy Order!
you have something that I want, and I want it."  Relik had already drawn his
weapon and replied, "Leave, beast.  You have no place here."  Archimaad had
urged his mount closer, to seperate distance and said, "I am here for Nilat.
Give it to me and I will leave.  Peacefully."
 
That was his mistake.  Closing distance allowed them enough room to
get the initative.  Once whom he had delt with easily before, Verac,
had lunged himself at Archimaad, plunging his blade into his abdomen.
Such a blow knocked him off of his horse and, honestly, had surprised
him.  With a swift kick he knocked Verac off and several feet back.
He got to his feet to see Relik, and two others he had never even met
before, charging at him.  His moral sank for a moment, as he knew he
was about to be rushed four to one.
 
They all took him on from seperate sides, each one of them plunging
their blades into Archimaad.  Pain surged through him as he suddenly
found three blades sticking through his torso, and seeing Verac get
up and ready himself to attack again.  With a swift motion, he bashed
his shield against the two he knew none of, sending them flying back.
He then swept Relik off of his feet with his lance.  When all three
around him were down, he lunged into the air.  He flew high up and
circled around, plunging down at his target, Relik.  In turn, he had
stabbed the man through his side.  He quickly pulled his weapon out
and backed up as Relik yelled and swung at him, whilst ducking when
Verac tried to lunge at him.  Spreading out his wings, he lunged into
the air for the same manuver.
 
Archimaad could see the look in their eyes as he flew away in great
distances and closed them in seconds.  He knew that look all to well.
It was the one that spelled coward.  Let them think what they would.
Archimaad had his tactics, and so far he could claim to still be alive
after so many battles.
 
When he dove down, he went for one of Relik's assisstors, a female.  He
heard someone yell, "Liseveta, duck!"  She tried to anticipate Archimaad
and dodge out of the way, but unlike Relik, he landed in akwardly for
someone trying to estimate him and delt his blow, dealing the same damage
to Liseveta as well.  At that percise moment, Verac and Relik flanked
Archimaad on either side, hacking away at his body.  He yelled out and
turned to deal a retribution blow to both; again, another mistake.
Liseveta had thrown her weapon into Archimaad's back, dealing yet more
damage to the draconian.  He drew himself out of Liseveta's blade and
continued to fight.  As blade and lance clashed with the three united
he could understand the thoughts on their mind.  Blood sprayed every
where and gashs of many pierced through Archimaad's body.  Warriors of
any kind would question life itself as to how Archimaad could still be
standing.  It was simple; war was his life.  This is all he knew.  He
could not lose so easily.
 
The battle went well, and Archimaad had enjoyed himself as the others
toiled.  But then it hit him, and literally.  Someone dealt a fierce
blow to his head that he would never forget.  He went sprawling to a
side, falling limp for just a moment.  His eyes could not adjust, no
matter how much he willed them to.  He tried to stand, but it was very
difficult.  He could hear someone say the name "Quinlin..."  He shook
his head and focused to see a powerfully built man smirking at him.  He
stood there as the others rushed at him.
 
Archimaad stood strong and continued to fight while they continued to
barrage him.  Weapons of all kinds began to pierce through his body.
He could even feel that which he worshipped so much; Death.  Could this
happen to him so soon?  It's a question one finally begins to realize
the very moment their life begins to slip away.  Then fear engulfed him
He scampered to his feet and tried to run.  He had no idea where he was
going or which way.  All he knew is that he still felt the slicing of
blades at his back.
 
Finally Archimaad collapsed.  He could no longer physically move.  He
saw, just above him, the man he had hunted.  Relik.  As a strange
phenomina, tears came to his eyes.  Tears of rage.  This is what he
would see in his final hour?  Knowing that this man could walk home
with the gift of victory over him had drove the fire in his heart.
Still, he could not move, and the final blow would come as Relik raised
his blade.  With a jabbing motion, he could feel the steel pierce his
heart.
 
Relik drew the blade out of his body and turned, walking away.  That was
it.  It was the end.  Archimaad, with the last of his breath, yelled "Lord
Aeleth!  Use my shell... take my form..."  And as his life left him he
could feel something new.  A feeling of eternity, as he moved on and his
body replaced with something else... Death itself.

Death.  Some people believe that with the good deeds they do, they
go to a heavenly utopia and forever rejoice with their God.  Others
believe for their acts of evil, they go to the deepest depths of the
Abyss and face Takhisis herself.  However, Death was not as all it
had been expected to be.
 
Well... For Archimaad at least it was different.  He felt limp and
unable to move.  There was nothing but darkness.  He knew he could
see, because he could see himself.  However, there was nothing there
to look at.  He couldn't move, and he couldn't feel.  It was as if
though he were floating as light as a feather.  Something seemed
amiss to him here...
 
Was this Death?  Why had he not stood up again to serve Aeleth in the
undying Legion?  Archimaad began to panic.  Had he displeased Aeleth
because he had failed?  This couldn't be it!  It wasen't fair... he
had fought his hardest and then some.
 
He felt a sinking motion.  He could feel that he was slowly floating
down.  Where down lead to, he didn't know.  For all he knew he could
really be on his stomach and being somehow dragged upward.  However, a
scene unfolded infront of him.  It was a graveyard.  He knew this place.
It was the graveyard in Palanthas.  Yet, everything was grey and slightly
blurred.  He was the only thing solid in this mess.
 
"Archimaad..."  He could hear in a faint whisper.  He whirled around to
see a black mass behind him.  He jumped and took a few steps back.  The
thing, whatever it was, hissed a strange laugh and said, "You fear your
own kind?"  Archimaad let himself untense.  He saw that though the mass
had no definate shape, it had two solid, glowing blue eyes in its center.
 
Archimaad tilted his head and asked, "Who are you?"  The creature looked
at Archimaad thoroughly, and seemingly through him.  The creature spoke
again to say, "I am the Dread Wraith of the Deep.  You know nothing of me,
and do not even ask.  I am before your time.."  The thing, this Wraith,
had paused for a moment before continuing.  "What you see is real.  It
is how you will see for eternity.  In Undeath.  Being what you are, you
could be no corporeal soldier of the Legion... but a disembodied spirit
has done you wonders.  What you see yourself as now only represents what
you were in life.  Mere illusions."  Archimaad looked down at himself.  He
looked solid, and everything on him was so as well.  The undead continued
to say, "You exsist in the ethereal plane at this moment.  You are half
real and half... well, not.  You see yourself as what you were.  Others
will too... but only as a ghostly visage."
 
Anger would have been the responce of choice.  His body was gone, and
he was merely a shadow of his proud self.  Anger didn't come.  He felt
nothing.  No emotion.  He looked down and said, "I want to feel.. hate.
But I can't..."  Laughter rung as the Wraith said, "Undead don't feel!
Have you never realized that!?"  Archimaad merely nodded, unable to
quiet understand yet.  The Wraith hovered around Archimaad and said,
"You will need time... time to understand what you are now.  Time to
adjust.  You are a Wraith.  You have no need to spill blood anymore.
You simply take life from another."  Archimaad merely bore his gaze
down at the ground.  The Wraith hovered there for a moment, before it
turned and floated away.  It said back, "You are still powerful.  Your
will is all you need anymore."

Darkness has fallen over the town of Solanthus, and the bright moon of
Solinari begins to rise into the pitch black sky, surrounded by a sea of
stars.  Passersby walk hurriedly through the streets, not even bothering to
glance up at the beautiful scene overheard; they are just eager to get to
bed so they can live out the next day.  Eventually, as the night wans, the
local drunks are heard making their way back to their homes, singing in
harsh, loud voices.  These, too, fade, and a deep and heavy silence fills
the city, save for the occasional gust of cold, winter wind.  
 
The Cleft Spires.  Right in the middle of the town, this natural formation of crumbled rock juts out into a large V, pointing southwards. There is a tiny path cut into the rock, just wide enough for a man on horseback to get through comfortably. As the first watch begins, a sudden flare of light is seen high up on the eastern side of the Spires, which eventually fades in time.
There have been recent reports of ghosts within the hills, men reporting the sound of wings rushing over their heads, then looking up to see nothing. It's said mysterious bones lay about, seemingly chewed clean of their flesh. And, worst of all, a strange feeling...almost like you're being watched.
 
 
 
The Baaz draconian Geitz sits on his haunches high atop a large boulder within the Cleft Spires, a small lantern burning bright next to him. His large, dragon-like wings are slouching over his shoulders as he keeps a close eye on the trail, leaning back on his long, club-like tail for balance.  The scales on his face are smeared with grime, the cheeks sunken in slightly.  His body, too, is oddly thin and frail-looking, his long, black robes tattered
and stained, the armor he wears underneath them dented and worn. Thoughts are racing through his mind, all spoken in his native, Draconian tongue, as he stares up at the stars overhead.
 
"{D"They seek to end me. Already Xane has dealt me a deadly blow...how I survived, I know not. But Lady Life...what is She planning? Avenger? And what of this Mohto Fortimange...{w"
 
He makes a deep grunt in his throat, and spits out a long, sticky strain of saliva which splatters against a nearby stone. The draconian exhales a deep sigh.
 
"{DSo many years as General of the Eternal Legion...and for what? I suppose I should consider myself lucky that I even exist at all, what with all the hands my soul has passed through. But still, here I am, forced to live off of the local farmers...stealing their livestock, hunting for rats and mice...and the occasional, rather unlucky, rabbit.{w"
 
A thin, chuckling sort of hiss escapes his thin, scaly lips, but it is quickly stifled. The baaz peers about himself wildly, then slowly shakes his head.
 
"{DThey seek to end me...but it will not be so. I must survive....I will survive.......{w"
 
With that, the draconian lays on his back, peering up at the starry sky overhead. Eventually, he closes his red eyes and sinks into a uneasy sleep, awakened every hour by nightmares that leave him shaken.

The morning had dawned as usual... For some, bright and warming.  For others, just another shade of grey in which they were surrounded.  Archimaad was now such a being, coldness seeming to radiate from his wraith-like form.  With a mission in mind, he had made his way back into Palanthas, the citizens repeating their actions of the day before, instantly barring their windows and doors, fearful glances cast in his direction before demurely lowered and the curtains shut quickly.
 
Liseveta, during this time, was between her rounds of training, the woman then resting in the courtyard of Paladine's temple.  It was there that she was sought out, at first, the woman leisurely relaxing upon the edge of the fountain.  Soon, a voice began to whisper into her head, turning her blood icy as it coursed through her veins.  'You are one that took my life...'  Those words rang in her head, causing the woman to instantly tense with wariness and unease.  
 
Pulling out her parchment and the stick of charcoal, the mute woman had written quickly, 'Who are you?'  In answer, Archimaad's wraith-like form had appeared, words spoken hurriedly before he lunged at Liseveta, intent on doing her harm.  Narrowly missing the powerful lunge, she was on her feet in an instant, quick, surefooted steps taking her into Paladine's temple.
 
Catching her breath, quickly pondering her choices of attack, she was startled to find the wraith had followed her, the sinuous form slithering into the temple.  Knowing it's intent, and with very few words spoken between them, Liseveta had crooked a finger and drifted off to the south, her intent being that of getting such a being out of the sacred place, the other only she would know.  
 
 
Being followed further south, she stopped once she had cleared the Temple courtyard.  Turning to face Archimaad, she removed her weapon, tucking it away before lifting her chin, revealing the still-healing scar that runs across her neck.  'What is this?' Archimaad had demanded, the woman quickly pulling out a parchment and her charcoal with which to answer.  'I have met death before, and I have survived.  I do not stand a chance alone against a powerful being such as yourself.'
 
Archimaad took this news with a bit of glee, thinking he wouldn't have to fight to get what he wants.  Within moments, Liseveta's form had been pinned up against the brick of the music shop, the woman now struggling as he voices the pain that shall ensue.  Blackish tendrils of mist reach for her, encompassing the woman's smaller form before a pair, seemingly the wraith's hands, dive straight into her chest.
Feeling the icy grip around her heart, Liseveta had tried, in vain, to push the creature away from her, her mouth open in a silent scream.  
 
A bluish glow emanating from her chest, Liseveta had watched almost helplessly as a replica of her was beginning to be torn from her chest.  Feeling a numbness creeping into her, one of those replica arms slipping free from her body before her actual arm would turn numb, she tried the impossible.  Reaching into her cloak, she pulled forward a dirk, though Archimaad was too quick for her.  
Her weaponed hand grasped, a yell was given by the wraith as he pulled with a violent, brutish force, ripping Liseveta's soul from her body.
 
Her body continued to watch for a mere second before crumpling to the ground in a dainy, lifeless mass, her soul now staring at Archimaad as she tried so hard to conceive what was happening.  Finding a voice in death that she no longer had in life, a tortured, inhuman scream soon filled the otherwise quiet city's walls, ripped from her throat as anguish tore through her soul.
 
Her world was grey now, the only thing hinting at color being the man before her, Archimaad appearing to her as he did in life.  'You will help me,' he demanded.  Stubbornly, the woman growled after him.  'I will not!  I won't have any part in harming those I consider my friends!'  This said, Archimaad seemed to laugh.  'Think you it would be that easy?  I no longer need your friends, as I am content now that one of you has to live like I do.  Welcome to my world.'
 
Unable to accept this, Liseveta stood hovering near her lifeless form before she moved closer to Archimaad.  'How do I get my body back?' she asked, though almost timidly.  The answer, though, was one that would haunt her for the rest of her days.  'We need the blood of life.'  Though not fully understanding at once, it took a moment for it to dawn upon her.
 
Refusing to even think further upon such a vile act after words were clarified, she watched as Archimaad left her, the woman-wraith now staring down at her own corpse.  'The blood of life.  The sap of the Tree.  It will never come to be,' she whispered to herself, dooming herself to an eternity of romaing the world as Archimaad does.

The barbarian nods to Nuantho as he exits 'The Portal'. He then heads north through the tower district to Temple Row. He starts walking east on Temple Row to the stables. He silently purchases and mounts a horse from the stable boy.
The horse trots east down Temple Row and out of Palanthas. The man guides the horse through the winding path in the coming mountains, making his way north. He gets to a relatively straight road and the horse trots steadily north. He sees a man coming up ahead on the road and stops his horse about 25 feet away from him and waits for him to get to him. When the man gets close enough the barbarian begins to speak.
'{CExcuse me, do you know of a dark marsh up further north?{X'
The man doesn't respond. The barbarian raises an eyebrow at the man and inquires,
'{CI have been sent here to retrieve something from the marsh, do you know how much further it is?{X'
The man gasps and lowers his head and continues onward down the road. The barbarian, clearly confused, simply continues further up the road. The trees begin to thicken around the path and the barbarian thinks, 'I must be close.' As he proceeds further, he reaches a dank and dark swamp.
He scans the area, and upon seeing no-one, proceeds further into the swamp. He comes upon a decaying tree trunk and dismounts his horse, tethering it to it. He proceeds even further into the marsh, where the trees are so thick that little penetrates their cover and the ground is so soft it envelops almost his whole foot with each step.
He hears some murmering off in the distance and announces himself.
'{CWho is there?! Show yourself!{X'
He heres some shuffling and then all is silent once more.
He walks back to his horse, untethering it and mounting it. He heads south out of the swamp, realizing he may become outnumbered if he continues alone. He guides the horse back down the winding path into Palanthas. He heads down Temple Row to Vingaard Road and into Myrtal's Roost, where he is greeted by his ranger friend, Talbadar. Talbadar speaks.
'{GGreetings again Luther.{X' He examines the barbarian, '{GYou look a bit... well... filthy.{X'
'{CI have been traveling through a marsh, I am in search of a Book for someone. Would you mind joining me?{X'
'{GWho is the book for?{X' Talbadar inquires.
'{CHe never told me his name, but he gave me half the money up front, so I asked no questions.{X' Luther responds.
Talbadar thinks for a moment, then replies, '{GI've got nothing better to do, so I'll help you.{X'
Luther beckons for Talbadar to follow and leaves the roost, tailed closely by Talbadar. He stops back at the stables and buys a second horse for Talbadar, who mounts it and follows Luther down Temple Row out of Palanthas.
As Talbadar follows Luther, he watches him, thinking, 'Luther is never this quiet. I wonder what's wrong.'.
 
The truth is, Luther despises magic, and knowing he is going to be facing a renegade wizard has him on edge. He is confident in his abilities in armed combat, but when it comes to magic, he is close to clueless.
 
Luther leads on, occasionally looking back to make sure Talbadar is following. They get to the point where the trees begin to thicken up again, and Luther slows his horse and leads in.
He reaches the decaying stump from before and stops his horse, tethering it once more. Talbadar does the same and they continue further inside.
They walk side by side, Luther occasionally looking to Talbadar to see if he has noticed anything peculiar. Luther then stops, sniffing the air and snarling.
'{GWhat is it Luther?{X' Asks Talbadar as he looks back to Luther.
Luther's eyes narrow as he looks ahead, '{CThe stench of magic.{X'

To: all
After many nights spent in Neraka, deep in both thought, and prayer, I knew what I had to do.. I lead myself to the Stronghold, to the temple, to find just who I needed, Lord Razel. He was there, kneeling before the altar, with his head bowed, a soft mutter leaving his lips. Prayers. I simply stood at the entrance, knowing what needed to be said, my mind strong.. guided.
 
"{DLord Razel..{x" I said, the words leaving my lips calmly and quietly; my head still lowered a bit, as I spoke, out of respect for the temple. I slowly lifted my head, and straightened myself, to face Razel fully, and crossed my arms; deeming it necessary. "{DWe need to speak..{x" I forced myself to add, only to specify his reaction more to my liking.
 
Razel unexpectedly stops at the first sound of my voice, though finishes his quiet prayer before slowly rising, and still facing the altar, he bows to it, a gesture of reverence, supposedly, before he faces me. "{DYes, my Lord..?{x" He says, the words evenly spoken, with a humble tone.
 
I exhaled slowly, even deeply, to see the reaction of Razel, to try to show an emotion, even if grief. "{DI have put much thought into this decision,{x" I said, my expression hardening a bit before I continued, "{Dand I have done much planning, to find a solution to any possible problem that could arise..{x" Stating such quite plainly, I hoped for a more.. positive reaction.. though I still expected a harsh one.
 
Showing no facial expression, Razel nods slowly, the only response vague, with his eyes staring blankly into mine, as if in thought, of anything.. contemplation, or otherwise.
 
I nodded once, leveled, and measured perfectly, graceful even, as far as a nod goes. Though the odd expression of my own, even if hardly visible, unchanging. "{DI will be stepping down, as Lord of Night, Lord Razel..{x" Razel's interest seemingly perked with such simple words, though he chose to hide it. "{DThe position will be passed down to you; and I will be posted in Neraka.. the Queen wishes for me to revive her armies..{x" I said surely, my tone quite smooth, and convincing.
 
Taking a while for a descent response to formulate, Razel appeared to be quite confused, "{DLord?{x" He asked respectfully, though I'm sure he meant pardon, for lack of better words.. "{DThis is very.. unexpected...{x" Pausing for a few moments before a smile begins to work its way upon his face. "{DI will work with you in any, -any- way you want; and the Queen will flourish above all else.{x" He said, apparently, concealing as much enthusiasm as he could.
 
A slight, involuntary smile of my own began to form on my lips, and I began to nod, as expected. "{DShe shall..{x" The words left my lips slowly, before I continued, "{DI know that you have potential, Lord Razel, which is why I expect everything. Lead well, Razel, and show your might to the Queen.{x" I stated firmly, my eyes carefully drifting to the corner of the room; I could've sworn I felt a presence.
 
"{DExpect several visits from me, Lord.{x" Razel says, his smile broadening, as he extends his hand towards me. "{DIts been a pleasure serving under you, Lord Roivas.{x"
 
Hardly hearing his words, I began to focus on the corner of the temple, and the shadows that shrouded it. I had lost my sense of reality. I knew something was there. I felt it.
 
Seemingly out of the shadows in the corner of which I was focused, a beautiful woman with pale skin and long black hair slowly faded into existence, my eyes slowly widening with each moment, and my expression falling blank.

The pale skinned beauty swished her long black hair, and it fell seductively about her face.. I'll never forget the sight.. as she slowly.. gracefully made her way towards the both of us.
 
Razel's hand dropped immediately as my expression was noticed, and he to turned himself around slightly, to cock his head to the side and find what I was seeing himself, though as his eyes fell upon her, his head dropped instantly in reverence.
 
Making her way intricately towards us, she stops in between us both, at which point, my head finally drops, in the near presence of the woman. Paying no mind to me, she turned directly to Razel, and bent over, placing a gentle finger beneath his chin.. Oh, how I envied him.. as she slowly lifted his head, her voice so perfectly lustful, as she whispered "{bStand..{x"
 
Razel, shaking lightly at her touch, even, forces himself to lift his head, and straighten himself; though he is unable to look her in the eye, for whatever reason, his trembling proceeding to worsen as he stands.
 
The pale skinned woman slowly stands straight up, and turns to me, yet my head remained lowered.. I felt like it needed to be, so that I couldn't see her face, instead, my eyes were fixed upon her chest. She then took me with both hands, by my hips, and pulls herself in, close to me, leaned in a bit, and lowered her head; to place her chin just below my shoulder.
She then inhaled deeply.. so deeply.. as she ran her nose, which was lightly pressed against my shoulder, along my neck, and up the side of my face, until it reached my ear.
 
I kept my head lowered.. faced with a combination of honor, awe, and nervousness as she acted. Choosing to simply await further action, I held my stance, firmly, though couldn't help but to bite my bottom lip out of anxiousness..
 
Her lips almost seemed to nibble at my ear and her whisper sounded almost like soft music.. "{bYou have chosen the path which I have always planned for you, the knights will be left for Razel; and you will find glory in Neraka.. I have watched you walk longingly in that place and I bless your path.{x" I simply stood, words unable to reach my lips..
 
She pushed herself away from me after a few silent moments, to turn and face Razel once more. She looked back her and offered me a smile.. which I hardly noticed.. still awestruck.. before she whipped her head around to look at Razel, and she beckoned him towards her single, tempting finger.
 
Razel took the few steps required to close the space between him and the woman, though he does it so quickly.. with such desire.. it would seem as if she drew him near her..
 
The pale woman spoke to Razel, though her voice still quiet, "{bYou will continue to lead my Knights; as Roivas has said, though until the ranks of the Lily swell, there shall be no Lord of Night, no one needs the role, at this point in time..{x" She tilted her head to the side, a playful expression haunting her now. "{bDo you understand my wishes..?{x"
 
"{DI do, my Queen.{x" Razel said, a humble tone finding its way to his voice, as he speaks, then lowering his head, he stands, his entire body still shaking slightly in her presence.
She smiled, before twisting herself around, to face me once more. "{bAre you now ready to continue your path..?{x" She asked me, a strange, indescribable tone to her voice.
 
I only nodded once, though it was very firmly. "{DI've always been ready, my Queen.{x" I stated, yet sadly, it was too plain for my liking.
 
She tilts her head to the side once more, her seductive smile growing. "{bI look forward to seeing the shadows of Neraka stirring again..{x" She said quietly, before turning around, and heading for the shadows that she appeared from, a gentle hand placed on Razel's shoulder as she walks by; directly into the shadows disappearing with that, leaving the room silent.

And so it continues.
 
Another glimpse of reality pulls me into conciousness and a very
familiar state of druken stupor as my eyes flash open and my hands
flail about aimlessly.  I can feel the eyes bore on me, I know what
they're thinking... I always know what they think of me.
"{yDon't..{x" the words escape my mouth on their own as I realise
a hand reaching for the pouch dwindling from my waist.  The glint
of a few steel pieces and a handful of gold peeking out to the
weary.
 
"{cLike you can do much,{x" the man answers my warning after a
moment of hesistation.  He reaches for the pouch again, but this
time his hand is held back by a figure I cannot yet make out, though
whose aura is god-awful familiar.
 
"{dThe man said 'Dont.'  If I were you I'd respect his wishes, if only
based upon one's seniority.{x"
I recognise that voice... someone I know, or maybe someone who knows
me?  Someone I paid?  Someone I owe?  A grude... a friend?  Who?  My
thoughts play foolery on me again, as they always do... as they enjoy.
 
"{dCordani, look at the shape you're in.  I remember when I first met
you.  So much potential... I actually thought you were going to make
some changes--I actually believed you had it in you to be somebody.{x"
So did I.
"{dI guess I was wrong, ne?{x" The voice pauses a moment.  I have no
idea what happened to the man who had reached for my pouch a few
sentences, convictions ago... did he leave?
 
"{yI never gave up.{x"
 
"{dNo?{x"
 
I didn't give up?!  Than what the hell do I call vanishing to God-knows
where while the world revolved without me!  What was throwing all these
plans into motion though never paying any heed as to what was needed
to be done afterwards?  Never gave up!?  Who the hell do I think I am
even coming back?!
 
"{dThere are always new faces, new memories... I didn't realise you want
to be just that... another memory.  I was looking forward to that legacy.{x"
He didn't even have to reply directly for me to feel his tone indicate
that he felt every thought going through my troubled mind.
"{dThe Gods are not to blame, Cordani.  You are.  You took a step but as
soon as you felt the water was cold, and not warming to your touch, you
fled.  Didn't you?{x"
He was not asking me a question, he was forcing me to admit.  He was...
trying to break me.
 
"{yI... I tried.  I am trying... there are so many things, so many factors
in this... in life... in everything!  How can you try to put the blame on
me?  What control do I have when the Gods pull the strings?{x"
 
"{dThey pull the strings, but not yours.  Am I right, Cordani?{x"
No... please, I cannot be broken.
"{dYou've always had this anger, this determination... but not against the
Gods because they pull all the strings, but against yourself and even the
Gods because they do not pull your strings.  Because you have the power of
control, of choice... of... great.. great potential.  Yet you feel you have
no control over it.  You pray it were someone else.  Don't you?{x"
What does he mean?  I am no different... everyone I've met.. potential...
"{dEveryone is different though.  Who besides you have the vision?  Not just
opinion like those around you, but vision.  Vision of the Gods, Cordani.
Even I can only fade into a memory.. even in all my power and glory I cannot
do what it is you set out to do... as even my strings are pulled by the Gods.{x"
I realise I am completely sober, though I still cannot see this figure.
"{dI am not trying to break you, Cordani.  I am trying to bring you back.{X"
 
"{yBut I tried.. I could've--but there are so many things pulling down on me!
Not just the people around me, the Gods in the heavens, but even myself!  How
can I possibly find the time to find myself again, let alone change the world?!{x"
 
"{dBecause I know what this is all about.  When you first set out in determination
it was all for her.  You captured her attention a moment but it slipped away
as you did.  Re-capture it, Cordani.  {DBecome a Legacy.{x"
 
And so I take the empty takard of ale and look at it in disgust.  My slobber
from last night staining the rim.  No more of this drink.  No more of these
excuses.  I am Cordani.
 
I am Cordani, you will remember me... because if anything...
I will become a legacy.  I will.

I take in a deep breath and sweep her into my arms, her lithe frame

the stars are starting to blur, the fastest I get this done the best.
 
She squeals happily and wraps her arms around my neck as I run.
She is married to a Solamnic Knight.  Why does this feel good?
I am coming back.

|   For countless generations, the Knights of Solamnia were drawn only from the|
| youth of Solamnic nobility. Often times, their families were tied closely    |
| to the Knighthood, with such names as Brightblade, Crownguard and Tallbow.   |
| This was especially true during the Age of Despair, when the Knights were    |
| largely despised. Few young people in those days wanted to become Knights and|
| those who did were most likely coming from families where joining the Knigts |
| was a long standing family tradition. During, and after, the War of the Lance|
| the Knights opened their ranks to non-Solamnics and allowed those not of the |
| "blue blood" to ascend to their highest ranks. This accounting is nothing    |
| short of such things being proven. In my travels, I came across a young      |
| cleric by the name of Kaeliwen Mirknai. He was a young man that was quiet,   |
| yet humbled and honourable. His descendance coming from the Mirknai family   |
| name, a well known Solamnic family. It is within these following scrolls that|
| I shall write the accounts of our travels together across Krynn.             |
|   To begin, it was nothing less than a fateful day in Solace, at the Inn of  |
| the Last home. I was sitting there, having a nice little meal when this young|
| man came through the door. I had a chair available at my table where there   |
| were no others. He asked if he might sit for a moment or two. I offered him  |
| the seat. Gladly I agreed and he sat down without a word. He was a quiet as  |
| he sat there. He ate a small bite, drank a small bib, paid and then left. He |
| intrigued me. I paid my fare and got up, following him out several paces back|
|   For twelve days, we traversed from Solace out into the plains of the       |
| Que'shu. There, we stumbled across a woman laying in the fields, sobbing.    |
| The young man stopped, a look of compassion upon his face as he knelt down   |
| and helped her to her feet. She told of a Draconian from the far city of Xak |
| Tsaroth that came into their village, mounted upon a warhorse with almost an |
| entire company behind him. She informed the young cleric that the Draconians |
| stole their months worth of food supplies and a very special ring to her. A  |
| ring given to her by her grandmother. Without a word, the young man helped   |
| her a several miles north to her village. There, he removed a ring bearing   |

| the family crest of the Mirknai family. Without another word, he set out     | 
| across the plains, heading straight for Xak Tsaroth. We travelled for at     |
| two more days time. Before we reached the city, we came across the draconians|
| lounging lazily at a half-heartedly created camp.                            |
|   Without a word, he strode into their camp, straight to the leader. His     |
| were steady and his demeanor calm, but complex. He stood their quietly, the  |
| draconians caught in a state of shock and awe. He seemed to be searching for |
| something, and then found it. His hand reached out and gently lifted a small |
| golden ring on a chain from around the draconians neck and put it in one of  |
| his pouches. He turned without another word and strode away. I stared in awe.|
| The draconians snapped from their own personal state and stood, drawing their|
| weapons. Ther cleric stopped and turned then. He gazed at them for several   |
| long moments. He knew he was outnumbered. He attempted, then, to strike a    |
| deal with them. To let him walk away without a scratch, or to have the leader|
| duel him in honorable combat.                                                |
|   Their gutteral laughter brought pain to my ears as their leader stepped    |
| forward and remarked about how easy it would be. The young cleric, weapon    |
| still at his side, stood with his hands folded in his robes and ammended the |
| bargain. If he were to win, the draconians were to take the food back to the |
| village without a word. In return, he would replace the food lost to the     |
| draconians. The draconian leader thought of this for a moment and then nodded|
| his agreement. I could only assume that the young cleric knew better than to |
| believe that a draconian, or his posse, would actually keep true to their    |
| word. What happened next was purely astounding.                              |
|   The young cleric opened his mouth and roared a fierce battlecry as he leapt|
| at the draconian, battering him to the ground with one fell swing. The downed|
| draconians companions leapt quickly to the aid of their leader and with a    |
| swift fray and series of movements taught only to the Knighthood, the young  |
| cleric swiftly smashed his way through them. Barely had the battle begun and |
| it was over. The young man stood there for several long moments, catching his|

| breath. After several long moments of silence, he reattached his weapon to   |
| his belt and sat down in the grass, cross-legged. His eyes closed. I thought |
| it only to be but a mere state of short transcendance, but I was wrong. For  |
| five days, we sat there in the fields, I to myself and my writings and the   |
| cleric to his meditations. On the sixth day, he rose and uttered a prayer to |
| Habbakuk. By the pendant he wore proudly upon his chest, I could only assume |
| that this young cleric was a true cleric of the Blue Phoenix.                |
|   He spent the entire day hitching the horses and the wagons together, never |
| once asking me for my help. On the seventh day, we rested for the journey    |
| back to the village. And it was on that day that we rode into the village    |
| the horses, wagons, and more than enough food for the village. It appeared   |
| that the draconians had been raiding villages all across the plains for food.|
| The village elders stared in awe at their new found assets. The cleric leapt |
| from the lead horse and handed the reigns to a young man who'd come running  |
| to see what all the commotion was about.                                     |
|   The cleric strode across the village to the hut where he knew the woman was|
| and it was there that he found her. He found the woman kneeling over her     |
| grandmother who had apparently fallen ill at the news of the lost heirloom.  |
| The young woman looked up at the cleric once more with tears in her eyes and |
| the same look of compassion crossed his face. He knelt down next to the woman|
| then and attempted to heal her. His faith could not heal her. The pain and   |
| sickness was not a pain and sickness of her health, but of her heart. The    |
| young cleric was at a loss as to what to do. He, too, then began to cry. He  |
| could tell that the older womans health was failing rapidly.                 |
|   And then with a look of wisdom crossing his face, he smiled. He reached    |
| into his pouch and withdrew the ring. He handed it to the young woman whose  |
| face brightened immediately. She held the ring out to her grandmother with an|
| exciting reverberance of hope. The grandmothers eyes befell the ring and she |
| smiled. Her smile was wise and calm, no longer pained. She was still ill, but|
| her health would fail no more. The young cleric rose without another word and|

| rose without a word. We left the village that day and headed out. We crossed | 
| the plains and then the threshold into Xak Tsaroth within twelve days time.  |
|   The city was filthy. Dirt and mud and darkness everywhere. The cleric      | 
| seemed to be the only lighting hope within the city. Within the middle of the|
| city, we came across the Captain of the Guard. The man was bedecked in armor |
| of titaniu, bearing the a blade of flame. The young cleric stopped then and  |
| gazed at him. The Captain seemed fierce and thirsty for blood. The cleric had|
| spoken with the Captain then, resurrecting memories within the Captains mind |
| of a time when the Captain was a Captain within the ranks of the Solamnic    |
| Knights. It was with this man that the young cleric knew he would find even  |
| the smallest bit of honour left. The young cleric stood before the Captain   |
| and then challenged him. The Captain was allowed to ask him two riddles. If  |
| the young cleric answered correctly, the Captain would escort him through the|
| city and to the Port to Port o' Call.                                        |
|   The Captain, having been a man of his word, agreed to the arrangement. He  |
| began asking the riddles. Now, while I cannot clearly remember them all, I   |
| do understand the gist of them. The Captain asked the young cleric about a   |
| "treasure chest" and it turned out to be an uncultivated dragon egg. The     |
| young cleric achieved his first correct answer. The second riddle was along  |
| the lines of a growing tree that never dies. Unfortunately the young cleric  |
| was unable to answer this question. The Captain grined with glee, but offered|
| a third chance. The young cleric, the honourable man that he was shook his   |
| head and remarked that that was not necessary. He would return the way he    |
| came and find another passage to Port o' Call. A wise decision I had called. |
|   The Captain, on the other hand, did not feel it such a move. With a snap of|
| his fingers, the young cleric and I were completely surrounded by the Captain|
| and his men. The young cleric continued to be a man of calm demeanour. He    |
| stood there with his hands calmly folded in his robes and pardoned himself.  |
| He stepped right, then left but found no exit.He stood tall, then, in the    |
| face of his enemies and asked them what it was that they desired.            |

| The answer was not a very good one. They desired his downfall. They drew     | 
| their weapons and closed in. The young cleric reached out and took hold of my| 
| arm. The weapons raised and began to fall upon us. The young cleric uttered a| 
| quick word of prayer and there was a bright flash of white light.            |
|   I blinked once, then twice, then all became clear. I gazed around and found|
| myself back in Palanthas with the young cleric next to me. The young cleric  |
| turned to me then and asked me if I had any steel. It was unfortunate, but I |
| had to tell him that I had none. Without a word, which had seemed to be the  |
| way our entire journey had become, he reached into his coin purse and handed |
| it to me. He told me that it was for the Library of Palanthas and the        |
| Aesthetics Order. I was astounded. I had never seen such a generous offer in |
| the entirety of my life. He turned, and left me then. Immediately, I went    |

| adversities and bring hope and happiness back to the once sad and hopeless.  |

Subject A History of Dart~
Text
Located to the west of the great city of Palanthas, through the Vingaard Forest, is a small
town by the name of Dart. Although it is quite small, and the population of it has
has diminished over the years, it still has quiet a history, and here it is recorded.
 
Founded sometime during the Age of Despair by a small group of families. It slowly grew 
into a larger town. No one still living in the city today is certain of the year it was
established, but it was a ways before the War of the Lance. During its slow progression, a
wonderful, but small temple was constructed to Majere. It was the only one in the village,
and was a place of worship for many. As word of the completion of the temple spread 
from mouth to mouth, occasionally at first, but becoming more frequent, thieves began to
visit the temple for thier own ill gain. In order to combat this, the citizens of Dart decided
decided that a wall around their town was necessary, and so construction began. The old men of
the city, many whom served as guards in Palanthas, began to train the young men and
boys of the city in hopes of providing a proper defense, which worked for many years.
 
Now this style of life went on for many a year, until one day, at the height of their power,
the Seekers came to pay a visit to the city. Many of the inhabitants were oblivious to the
ongoings throughout the lands, and as such, treated the Seekers as they would anyone
else, and denied them access to the city. This proved to be a costly mistake for the
citizens of Dart, and within a few months time, they noticed a small army at their gate.
Instead of surrendering to the army before them, the men of the city chose to stand their
ground and fight, which subsequently most were killed in the battle.
 
Once the Seekers overwhelmed the forces before them, they proceeded to drive the
monks from the Temple, and left it a hollowed shell compared to what it used to be. The
army drove the inhabitants from the city, except the young and the old, many of whom
were unable to travel. Before they left, the army tore down the walls of the city, then
threatened to slaughter any citizens attempting to rebuild. So, the citizens fearful of their
lives decided to obey the Seekers words, and left the city as it was.
 
Now that the War of the Lance is over, the small number of inhabitants have gone back to 
visiting the small Temple of Majere, but it has been mostly left alone. Only the old
remember what it used to be like in their glory years. The kids seem to find it as just
another area to play. I suppose the city would have continued this way for years, if it were
not for a new proprietor of the city, one who calls himself Lord Kotoasa Sahaluin.
 
Just recently has Lord Kotoasa taken to rebuilding the city now that the fear of the
Seekers has long passed. The walls of the city has been rebuilt to its former strength, and
a large gate now stands in place where an open hole once was. Typically, the proprietor 
charges an entrance fee to the city, in hopes of gathering more funds to assist in the
rebuilding project.
 
One day, not long ago, while in a meeting with the proprietor, there seemed to be an odd
attack upon the city by a large Troll named, Bolgar. At the initial onslaught, the guards
fired wildly at the beast, and it appeared to be slain before the Lords eyes. Having noticed
this, Lord Kotoasa was furious. Not only did his wrath extend to verbal abuse of the
guards, but his strength was enough to raise the slain troll back to life. Whether Lord
Kotoasa has some deep hidden power, and this was a mere display, or some sort of
trickery, it is yet to be seen.  The young men who guard the city appear to do so more out
of fear of Kotoasa then anything else. Though, it is hard to say without further
monitoring. Believe this though, the city of Dart is being rebuilt, and there is something at
work there. Dart will once again be a place for people to come and see in the near future
if the proprietor can keep up at the pace he is going.

Atanate slowly raises his palm to let his lithe fingers gently frisk the
new, rough stubble on his otherwise smooth face.  How long it has been since
he's had a proper shower and grooming is long past his memory, how long
since he fled from the towers, his responsibilities as a father and a mage,
only a nightmare he fears he will one day, eventually have to face.  His
finger pause and abruptly follow his arm as it falls to the side, a
resounding *snap* breaking the silence in the thin, damp air.  Facial hair
has never been his forte, he's always been a man of cleanliness and
perfection--just look at him now.  {rI've almost forgotten who I am,
Goddess.  How could I ever show my face again?  My wife and child, who knows
what has come of them and what they will regard me as!  The Conclave will
probably shun me and cast me from their towers..  For I am in shambles and
will be a blemish within their ranks.  {x It's been a long time since
Atanate has called upon his Goddess, his eyes now stained with tears and
grief.  The room, his hideout for the last several months does little to
help the mood in his heart, in his soul.  Even on the brightest days it is
dark, damp, and strong with the smell of mold, mildue, disease.  There are
no windows and it is difficult to see even a foot infront of yourself--one
can easily go mad just sitting there for a few minutes.  Atanate, though,
has managed to find comfort in the nothing-ness around him.  He knows it's
the most, the only solitude he can find in his convoluted excuse of life,
existence.  And with his magick he can look out onto the plains around him,
onto the world that still revolves without him--longing to be one with
nature and emotion again.  As if he's already dead.  {RAtanate...  {x His
eyes widen and he almost jumps to his feet to get up--his knees wobble and
shudder from the sudden movement, as they have been used very scarcely in
the past few months.  "{rLunitari!  {x" Atanate calls as he mentally recites
spells to lighten the area and enhance his mental vision--in all the time
he's been in this 'seclusion' all he would do would be repeat and remember
every spell he was taught, and even a few he was told never to practice.  He
would starve himself daily until he knew he could go no longer, and even
then he would only let the most miniscule amount of magical rations suffice.
Self-inflicted torture, a cleric would say, if only there were one here to
pull the frail man out from this.  If only one would be able to. 
"{rLunitari, is that you!?  {x" Atanate cries again, his eyes swelling up
with tears.  He's always been a gentle man, one to show and embrace his
emotions.  But now, after all this time he is so easily brought to his knees
and his heart wrenches with pain on the slightest memory of happiness.  He
is so emotionally distraught that in his condition he could easily do a
mental and emotional switch of personallity with the slightest set-off or
empowerment.  All mortals yearn for control of themselves, do they not? 
"{rHave I been gone so long that you dareth not answer me?  Am I that much
of a shame to even my own Goddess?  {x" Atanate sinks back to his knee's,
ready to curl up into the fetal position and resume his secluded life,
return to the depths of his mind and push his heart even further into
darkness.  {rNo, Atanate.  Remember who you are and what robes you wear... 
You took the test, Atanate, you!  So very few are given the opportunity, and
even fewer are willing to take it!  Not only did you take the test but you
passed it...  You were given these robes and you...  {x Swallowing loudly he
shuts his conscious up.  He raises his hand to make sure he is still alive
and human, and as he does so he realises his robes are now stained and
filthy.  Shaking his head in disgust at himself he finally pushes his fears
aside and rises to his feet, a man.  With a word of magick the room
brightens and one can now see the distance to the fields around.  He is not
a man of greatness, not one in pursuit of greatness, but he is a man, and he
will strive to be accepted in his own likeness if no one else.

Subject The Legendary Blade Balancekeeper Pt.1~
Text
I had recently begun my travels to do my duty as the Knight of the Aesthetic Order, to seek and protect knowledge from those who would attempt to destroy it, when I came upon a library in a small town east of Solanthus. I had heard rumors that this town, known as Lemish, had become a foothold near to Palanthas for Takhisis.
When I arrived the rumors were confirmed, though this was not my focus on coming here. I had heard early in my travels of a library, ages old, deep below the city. When I arrived at where the entrance of the library was supposed to be, I found a group of goblins and what appeared to be a Knight of Takhisis unsheathing weapons in a group around an elderly man in a red robe typical of those that a librarian would wear.
I heard the Knight demand information of the Librarian, knowledge of an ancient sword dating back to before the cataclysm. The Librarian, as followers of Gilean are instructed to do, gave the information freely, however the Knight was displeased with the answer and ordered the goblins to attack. As was befitting of my station I rushed in to protect the Librarian, slaying the goblins and coming face to face with the knight. He turned and fled.
Having no quarrel with him, I did not follow, my mission was to protect the Librarian, not slay Knights. As a matter of curiosity, I asked the Librarian about the Sword the Knight had inquiried about. He told me it was called Balancekeeper, and that it was said to be blessed by Gilean himself. The wielder was charged with protecting the Aesthetic clan, and all who sought knowledge.
As it was growing late at this point, the Librarian led me down into the ancient library where, after perusing several volumes, I discovered more about the sword. Like the fact that the Legendary Guardian had a brother who also wielded a weapon blessed by Gilean. A "Lance of the Void" as it was called. In an old tattered book in a corner of an old bookcase I found a loose description of where the tomb of the Legendary Guardian was.
In fact, The tomb was at the back of this very library, concealed behind what is now a temple to Gilean, built to protect the sword. I made my way back to the temple, where I was greeted by another elderly Librarian. He told me that the two of them had been guarding the library, temple, and tomb by themselves for as long as either of them could remember.
That the attacks on them and their library had been growing more frequent and more violent as of late. I pledged to him that no longer would they have to do this alone, that from that day forward, I would assist them. I knew I could assist them better if I could get my hands on Balancekeeper, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. I kept reading the old book, but it had more to do with the Lance of the Void than it did with Balancekeeper.
The only way I could figure to get to the sword was to go through the temple, but I could not destroy the altar simply to get a sword, nor could I allow the violence necessary to break through a wall to occur in a library. I removed my sheath and placed it in front of the altar and I prayed to Gilean, keeping a constant vigil at the altar for a week defore I passed out.
When I awoke, I heard voices, three voices. I moved back into the library, away from the altar. I followed the voices as they grew in volume as though they were shouting. As I came around a corner I saw the Knight from the week before, he had returned with a fellow knight and know they were threatening the Librarian I had met that first day. They demanded he open the tomb and get them the sword or they would kill him.
None can open it but Gilean himself he informed them. This drove them into a rage and before I could reach them they both plunged their swords deep into his chest. Unable and unwilling to stop myself, I charged headlong into one of them, driving him into the wall and knocking the breath out of him. Before I could turn to the other, he had his sword raised and was alreasy swinging it at me.
I heard a loud clang and as I turned around, I saw the second Librarian standing there holding a quarterstaff, having just knocked out the second knight with it. The knight I tackled began to stir and I put my hand to my waist to get my sword. At that point I realised it wasn't there, I had left it on the altar!
I told the second librarian to run, to go with me back to the altar, but he didn't move, he just stood there, smiling sadly, as a blade was thrust through him, back to front, from the soldier I had knocked into the wall. I cried out, but there was nothing I could do. I ran back to the altar to get my sword, but as soon as I grabbed the hilt I knew something was different.
The Knight was close behind me so I didn't have time to look into it, I just grabbed the sheath, ripped it off and swung my sword in an arc that no trained swordwoman should ever have made, it shouldntve worked, I should have missed by a mile and been stabbed right then and there.
But it did work. The blade swung into the knight's neck, seperating his head from his shoulders. It was then that I saw it. The blade of this sword was not my own, this blade was crimson, this was Balancekeeper!
The knight the elderly Librarian had knocked out was stirring by the time I got back to where the old men had met their deaths. With a swift swing of my new sword I ended him. I laid the elderly Librarians to rest at the altar they had given their lives to protect and I began to make my way back to the town of Lemish, taking the little old book with me.

As I neared the exit it occured to me that it was odd that the two knights had come alone, and thats when I saw it. A draconian mage, standing there by the exit, waiting for me.
Though I had no quarrel with it, it sought to impede my exit, so I began to run forward drawing Balancekeeper as I went. When I was almost upon it, I could hear it chanting and I knew I had to destroy it before it could kill me. With a great lunge I thrust Balancekeeper deep within its body, which began to smoke.
I ran for the exit, as the consequences of interrupting the spell came. A great explosion occured, collapsing the entrance to the library of Lemish, and forever resealing the tomb of the Legendary Guardian. Form that day forward, I knew it was now up to me to uphold the title of Guardian, a title I would carry with Honor.

{C * It was later noted in the great chronicles of Astinus that a Silvanesti elf dressed in grey robes was seen in the town of Dart but one night before the wretched outbreak that would come to be known as the{x {y'Wrath of Morgion'{x{Cbegan to take Ansalon by suprise.'*

{x {y It was quite late in the evening as Ickaram, a kender known more for his blade than his pick locking skills, strolled into the town of Dart to see his old friend Lawrence McGreedy. Lawrence was a local street cleaner and a casual man. Thinking about old gatherings the two had in the past, Ickaram smiled. He had so many new adventures to tell his old companion about! 
Quickening his pace the kender rushed down the path only to stop in his tracks suddenly when he finally approached the small cottage. Whispering to himself, ' Odd, I've never known a fire not to be lit in the McGreedy fireplace at this hour. The man should be cooking by now, with all those children to feed. ' 
Stepping slowly toward the house, Ickaram noticed the front door stood open. Entering the door the kender saw small muddy foot prints leading into the tree line into town. Slowly edging into the house now, he almost trips over several rotting carcasses lying in the living room floor. ' Blessed be Jolly! ' , Ickaram exclaims. Rushing into the bedroom against the far wall, he sees his dear friend struggling to breathe. ' What has happened Lawrence!? ' , the kender blurts out. 
The sickened man replies in a whisper, ' There dogs went mad Ickaram.... they began to feed on my children! ' The kender looks away from the man lying at his feet , noticing several unmoving bodies on the bed. The children are dead. Looking back to Lawrence in time to see him take his last breath, the kender shakes his head. For the first time in his short life, the kender was speechless. 
Later while leaving the small cottage, there was not a sound to be heard in the streets. They were abandoned. The tragedy could be seen. The thought never once crossed the kender's mind. Was he to become sick?

Her eyes fluttered for as long as she could muster as rapidly as she
could muster until her head was finally severed from her body, her mouth
aghast in horror and pain and her lips twitching wildly.  It was her only
way of trying to tell the city dwellers that they had made the worst mistake
of their lives when they hunted her down and splayed her.  She had stood
before them reformed of her evil ways for she had seen the noble lady
Chislev and it had changed her life forever.  A pity it was not soon enough.
An irony that she had come before them to make amends and met her death for
her ill past.  In the meeting-hall of the gods the lady of nature pleaded on
her behalf.  Spare this druid.  She was on the right path before they found
her and mistook her for the evil she was.  She needs a chance to live and
follow the path to which she dedicated herself.  She possesses great
potential now that she has rejuvenated motivation and Im sure her skills
will be a blessing to those of Krynn if wielded for better purposes.  If she
strays from the past this second time around, then you may do with her what
you see fit.  It was lucky for the lady of nature that at the current
meeting of the gods, all the gods of the light were there to here her pleas.
The only problem was that the villagers had buried the pieces of the druids
mutilated body in separate graves, a hindrance for her possible salvation. 
The noble lady Chislev did the only thing she could and placed the soul of
the Elven druid inside of a creature of her own creation.  Perhaps it is
better this way my dear.  You loved me, were devoted to me, and so wished to
do right by my cause, but you were too cocky, too drunk with the powers you
chose to abuse for so long.  For now, you are demoted to this life form to
serve the will of others.  Perhaps only now you will understand the
selflessness and nobility of my cause.  A small tear slipped from Chislevs
eye as she finished weaving her simultaneous curse and blessing upon the
golem of plants.  Here it stands and here it shall stand.  It will only be
by the powers of a powerful conjuror that the golem will form and gain
movement once more.  Until then, the plants in the area still have the soul
of the distraught elf.  As she sits and weights, gathers and learns.  For
now, she is truly one with the nature she so loved.

I stand here, cowering as I kneel meekly before the god of the thieving
ones.  All my life I was considered lucky yet unlucky at the same time. 
Right when my life went right, something would always go wrong to change
everything back to the way it was.  I spent most of my life a gambler after
my parents death until I drained all of my inheritance.  I at first devoted
to Shinner, and the riches were finally more than enough to sustain me.  I
married a half-ling, fell in love, and even had children.  Where they are
now, I do not know.  At that time halflings were not liked by most anyway. 
I do hope they are safe.  My children I mean.  Where my wife is I do not
know.  It is my fault I guess.  We each exchanged harsh words the night she
ran from our mansion, swearing to all the dark gods and gods of the light
alike that I was no different than the rest.  Yes, it is true I did have a
mistress, but so help me, I did not expect her to find out, not so soon
anyway.  Afterwards I drank heavily.  I returned to my previous lifestyle. 
I guess even the might of shinner couldnt save me from the band of thieves
that robbed me one night.  Not simply robbed me, but followed me home.  A
rock-like being was waiting for me at the door of my prestigious house. 
Every time I attempted to enter, it would pick me up and throw me out of the
place -quite literally.  Having no home and no money, I quickly became a
beggar on the streets.  If only I could have gotten to my home to pawn a few
of my possessions once more just for a small taste of the exhilaration of
that sweet sweet gambling thrill.  Looking back on my death I now see the
error of my ways.  I now see that cursing shinner to the high heavens was a
bad idea.  Devoting to the god of the thieves was probably the worst step I
could make.  But here he is telling me I have served him well.  Its a pity
you had to die like that.  The good news is you were over do for a promotion
anyway I have done well by you my lord?  Yes, you have.  I am quite pleased.
I do apologize for the things I had to do to get you with me Elven, but in a
way, you saved me the trouble when you were thrown from that wagon into the
tree.  I am glad you are pleased my lord.  Lets see if we can make a deal
here.  You dont want to pay off your debt to me right now, right?  What can
you give me in return?  I have served you well my lord, all I ask is to
continue to do so however you see fit.  And continue you shall.  Well just
call this little favor I do for you a loan.  A loan that you shall pay back,
with interest.  Everything goes dark as a cold chill seeps into me.  Fear
grips my heart, mind, and nearly overpowers me.  Just when I think I can not
be any more frightened, I hear the most chilling words Ive ever heard.  They
do not ring to my ears as they did on the second plain, but instead are
piped through my head as if water through plumbing.  I need a spy, Elven,
one that will do as it is told.  One that remembers, thinks, and breathes,
but cannot be discovered.  I think your series of unfortunate events that
led you to me, most of which I caused, shall serve its purpose after all. 
Despite this minor set back, something can be worked out after all.  Be at
home with the water once more Elven.  See your mistress again.  Its the
cackle at the end that did it to me.  The last words I heard werent chilling
enough, he had to throw that cackle in there that grates against my nerve
endings.  The cackle that chilled me down to my very soul itself.  Gods have
mercy on me.  I should know by now, with the lord of the thieves, you dont
get something for nothing.  I have no doubt what he told me is true.  I
shall see my beloved once more.  I will feel the water of my homeland yet
again.  Possibly be embraced by my kind, but good gods, at wh at price?

Its true, its all true.  Your life does flash before your eyes right
before your death.  In the well over two centuries of my existence that I
lived, I only really have two comments about it.  The first and most obvious
one was, I spent way too much time in my own solitude.  The second one,
well, lets just say I slept way too much.  As my spirit left my body, I
watched.  I watched as the note that I wrote fluttered to the ground as my
body was consumed by the fire and dark energy that was raveled into my
existence quickly burnt my malformed body in to nothing but a pile of black
ash.  Sadly it did not, as I hoped, end there.  As I previously stated, its
true.  The dark queen was not pleased with me and the life I chose to live. 
Maybe, just maybe, if I followed my darker side I would not be in what is
possibly a position thats worse than my previous one.  From creation, I was
an outcast.  My scales were none of the colors of my usual brethren.  I was
not the size of the brothers that fly, yet I had wings that allowed me to
glide along the currents of the wind.  Looking back, I cant help but think,
maybe its right that it ends this way.  The only ones that understood me are
now dead.  I saw my new friend, my brother, and even the one that I wished
to pair with die and turn to stone.  Maybe if I went there before he made
the fatal decision things would be different.  Maybe he was Lucky.  Maybe
Takhisis herself will choose him to guard her in his next incarnation.  My
previous friend, a dark assassin devoted to Chemosh, took his own life years
ago.  Perhaps now, in death, he found the Solace he was looking for.  Now I
am finding out, like my brother did, that, apparently we are not allowed to
leave this plain of existence.  I will not be rocked in Takhisiss arms in
the darkness of the abyss like I hoped.  I will not be brought up to bow
before the gods of light for my good deeds.  Instead, it would appear that I
am being punished.  Punished for what, sadly, I am not aware, but punished
nonetheless.  As my eyes caught the note lying beside the pile of ash that
was once my now outcast form, I quickly glanced at it, wondering what my
next would be.  To who finds me: My name was Nicka, I was a cleric.  I was a
draconian.  Those that I assisted I wish you well.  Those of you that
despised me, may the gods have mercy on your souls and grant you a
punishment fit for your insolence.  The darkness has come, and I cannot join
it, nor can I fight against it.  For me, this was the best decision that I
could make.  Since I could do neither both because of the dark magic that
bonded me, and my heart that did not feel as my brothers did.  I decided to
choose to do neither.  It is both my fault, and the fault of the gods that
my life has came to an end here.  Myself, because I did not follow the
obvious instincts that were weaved into the black magic that was my soul and
existence and the gods, because not a one has showed themselves to me.  Not
even the dark queen herself, who, correct me if I am wrong, but, I was
created to serve anyways?  Do you know what its like to have power - immense
power.  The power to harm, the power to heal, and not have a god to follow? 
For a clerical being like myself, it is, insanity.  And I I choose to end my
madness.  
May the dark gods and the gods of the light do with me as they see fit.
My name was Nicka.
And I was, a cleric.

As you try to cast your next spell, you sense that the magic begins to flow in your vains and then, shockingly, fades away. You wonder what is going on, what might be happening. You try again to cast another necromantic spell, but now not even magic flows.... You hear a voice, a strong, powerful voice, a voice filled with power, a voice of a god.
 
"{DYou are to be given a choice, mortal. Such spells are controlled by me and me alone...and I do not see you worshiping my but instead my red cousin. I gave you time to re-consider your options, but you force me to take action. IF you want to continue casting the spells you already know of and already have in your spellbook, you will abandon the cause of Lunitari and join my own. If not, I will strip you of all the knowledge of magic you possess.
You have untill tonight, when the dark moon is high in the sky, to decide."{x
 
 
OOC: This means the following: necromantic spells only work if your allignment is evil. If you are evil, you are not a red robe. You can either join the Black Robes or re-create your character to one of the non-alligned based mage classes (enchanter, conjuror, illusionist). You won't be tested again, as it would be like learning a whole new area of magic and not learning ALL from the start, since your skill with magic and mental skills have been tested. Send me a note when you decide.
You have till the end of the 2nd of June to decide.
 

 
Yours truely, 
Nuantho Garein - Headmaster of the Conclave

Text
The night was peaceful, the silence of the hour relaxing in it's inherent simplicity.
Isaac lay against the board of his elegantly carved wooden bed and perused the large leather tome he had found on his fathers dresser.
Lately Issac had learned of his fathers meetings with the Lady Corillyn of house mystic. 
Issac had been carefuul to avoid any noticeable behavior that would arouse the ire of his father Pathos of House Servitor.
When the light of morning came Issac crept out of bed, tome in hand and headed for the kitchens for something to eat before he was forced to clean his masters quarters.
The role of his family as servants was to serve, so it was in the royal kitchens that Issac began scrubbing pots with a fervor.
Totally immersing himself in the menial labor to distract from the wierd behavior he had witnessed between his father and the Lady Corillyn.
It wasnt until later that that morning that Issac felt the gentle hand of Lady Corillyn and her voice quietly say "follow me young one" Turning to the leader of house mystic he trailed her to the gardens behind the speakers residence.
Stopping as commanded he watched the attractive face and was surprised when she said "Issac, your father has told me of your interest in magic, and has commended your habits to me, it is my wish that you be trained in the arts of wizardry.
Issac only nodded and asked "when do i begin my studies?" Corillyn smiled and replied "you shall learn the alphabet of the magi tomorrow, and from then on, i shall teach what little i know.

Subject {rFarewell Krynn (Consistency) - II{x~
Text
Consistency.
 
Atanate learned in the early stages of his training that consistency
was a good thing.  You had to be disciplined - memorize every syllable
and the correct pronounciation.  When you were skilled at your basic
magicks, you were to try and repeat the original formula over and over
again, never going off the edge, never making a mistake.  When you made
a mistake, you learned from it.  Maybe the spell was even stronger, and
you tried to repeat it.  Consistency was a way of life.
 
Atanate knew consistency.  Everyone knew what he was an expert at as
well.  There was one thing that Atanate could do that was better than
everyone else on the face of Krynn, and even the Gods out of it.  His
mastered art, one of a diamond clear consistency was that of failure.
Yes, failure.
 
Have you ever been too afraid to be right?  So sure that you were the
best, and could do what you set out to do with accuracy and efficiency?
Atanate thought so.  He was the best.  So good in fact, that he always
set himself up to fail.  Consistency.  He always failed, never made it.
 
Why?
 
Love.  Pain.  Life.  Magic.
When he fell in love, he soon fell out of love and experienced pain.
Overwhelmed by life and soon captivated by magic, Atanate unknowingly
started to plot in his head the perfect formula to keep him from ever
getting a broken heart again - do his hardest at wanting to be the best
but always take a step away as soon as it looks as if things might be
going his way.  It doesn't break his heart, it's the type of failure
and pain that he can easily get accustomed to.  Consistency.
Failure.
 
"{rI am sorry, Lunitari.{x"
 
The one reason Atanate did this was for a longer, better life.  But
again, as always, when you set yourself up to fail, you fail.
Atanate holds the jewel encrusted blade in his hand for a moment, what
a shame his life has been.  His goal was to become one of the Conclave
and now that he was on the right track, he had to step back.  Step away.
No more heartbreak.
 
Consistency.
 
No more.  The emotion surging through Atanate's veins as he holds the
dagger up high to end this consistent line of failure, is too much for
one to take in, through merely reading the texts of an old book.
How can this book be different than all of the others on the shelves.
Why, only because of its consistency.  Everyone knew what was going to
happen, and frankly nobody cares.  Especially Atanate.
 
"{rI do not deserve this magic.  I do not deserve this at all.{x"
 
Goodbye, Krynn.
-Atanate

Rays of Lunitari shone down this night, flashing through the windows with it's red brilliance, the sight of blood being hidden within it's mass.  Though hidden it's bitter smell still remained, letting a nauseous feeling cloud over the half-elf sitting here.  At the table before him was a meal fully prepared, candle lights still burning bright, a shame it all went to waste he thought.
 
Trudging down the stairs to his right came a rather large man, fat bursting out of his suit of plate mail.  With a wry grin he asks, "Tinassil, what shall we do with the bodies?"
 
"Hang them from the tree outside and burn the house.  Let it be lesson to all among Solace, submit to the Queen or fall to death."
 
The large man nods and begins to turn, but stops abruplty, "Do we loot the house?  These people have no need for there wealth in the afterlife."
 
"We take nothing, we are not thieves!  Lord Theriss ordered us to kill all who stood in the way, not ransack the place!"
 
With a frown the large man nodded and trudged back up the stairs.  Returning moments later two men followed behind, all three holding a corpse in hand.  The first held a man, the second a woman and the third a small child, looking to be only 14 summers old.
 
Standing from his seat Tinassil began walking to the front door, speaking as he walked.  "Do the same with any who stand in our way."
 
An hour later he sat on his mount, the house infront of him blazing wildly.  The three bodies hung from the tree near the house, swaying in the wind...-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Arngrim woke abruptly and sat up, sweat dripping from his face.  He lay near the Altar of Paladine, clerics running back and forth healing those in need.  "Strange dream" were the only words he spoke.

Within the vast moonlit forests of Solace there is drumming. Its distant cadence is like a sleeping heartbeat in the darkness. Slowly, it begins to grow louder, as if awakened.

A warm breeze shakes the leaves as lanterns flash signals through the branches. One by one, the dancing lights too spread through the trees, flickering in the windows of houses. From a distance, it's as if the forest is alive with a thousand fireflies. 

A single voice shouts out, and like a stone thrown into a pond it ripples outward until it has become a cacophony of joyful cries, singing songs of Solace's liberation.

Up comes the anchor, covered in barnacles. The pristine white sails are unfurled and cast long billowing shadows along the sunny deck. Osseus ponders the crew: an abrasive minotaur and a strange-speaking ranger. He thought he had detected the diminutive shadow of another passenger, but had been too preoccupied with the rambling anecdotes of the drunken captain to investigate. 

"Damn Miven! I told em' we was leavin'", Talfor mutters. Wrinkles spread around his eyes as he winces in the sunlight, scanning the docks below. "Oh well! Tighten the bowlines!" he growls. The flapping sails suddenly become taut and calm, and a warm wind carries the ship out to sea. 

Soon there's only the sound of the waves, the screeching gulls overhead, and the hooves of the minotaur stomping about on the wooden deck. Talfor casts the fishing nets out with a shrug. "Can't hurt!" he grunts, taking a swing from his silver flask. 

When the nets are raised a few hours later, they are like sad empty bellies, holding only a few bits of rusted garbage. The contents are dumped on deck. Suddenly, a tiny voice babbles, "allo!" Within the garbage there lies a single fish, blood red in color. 

"It's a bela fish," Osseus says, his blue skin now a sickly tinge of aquamarine. "Toss it back-- no good to eat, bad luck to kill, and they'll talk your ear off."

"Back!" says the bela fish. "Back, back, back, back, back..." The yammering fish flounders about, awaiting its fate.

As the crew gaze on, the ship's sails begin to droop lifelessly against the mast. The sound of the wind dies away, leaving only the rhythmic creaking of the ship. The sun sinks below the horizon, casting unsettling shades of crimson across the sky. 

The captain speaks up, his gravely voice reeking of rum. "I'll take first watch t'night. You lads get yourselves some sleep. That wind'll pick back up by mornin'" 

If the others linger on deck, Osseus does not notice. He descends into the hull, lost in thought. The last thing he hears is the captain's voice. "Fetch th' map and le's guess where we are."

After a long unexplained absence, Roivas searches for a ship, to return from his journey to Ergoth. Feeling almost drawn back to his home in Ansalon, he sails to the shores of Abanasinia. His searching driven only by hope, he walks, on foot, to the stronghold located east of Solace. Though no longer a Knight of Takhisis, he remains a High Priest, and knows he shall be welcomed to the temple within the stronghold -- even if for nothing but prayer.
 
Not quite as he expected, Roivas arrives at the stronghold to find it seemingly desolate, except for the guard and a few knights, which look distraught. One of them, an ogre, even steps forward, to speak. "Welcome, High Priest," the ogre says, respectfully. "Roivas, it is, correct?"
 
"Aye," replies Roivas, with a nod, although it seems to surprise him a bit. "I am only here to visit my Queen," he tells the men. The knights, seeming to ignore all else by the confirmation, continue speak again. This time, it is a human.
 
"You were once the Lord of Night, if I'm not mistaken?" he inquires, though obviously he was sure of the answer. 
 
"Many years ago," the High Priest recalls, speaking softly. "Does Lord Razel remain your leader?"
 
The knights look at each other with a bit of awkwardness, and the human says "Lord Razel is no longer Lord of Night, I'm afraid.. in fact, we no longer have one." This is the information that catches the interest of the man. Roivas ponders: could this be why I have been feeling drawn to this place?
 
It would be better to pray before assuming such a thing, he decides, and simply nods at the knights, turns on his heels, and begins to walk to the temple. "Wait, High Priest!" one of the knights calls, before he reaches the end of the hallway. "We have something to ask you." The ogre booms, saving the human from yelling again.
 
Roivas turns back around, and watches the knights jog up to him. "Will you take the place of our Lord, if only temporarily?"  the human inquires, and before he can reply, (seeing the expression on Roivas' face) the man continues, "the knighthood is in dire need of leadership. If for no one else, do it in the name of Takhisis."
 
That was enough for him, undoubtedly, it is Takhisis' will, he decides. Roivas, after praying, agrees to honor the knights' requests.

Following the wet footprints through the tilting bowels of the ship, he spots a black shape slinking into his companions' cabin ahead. A tangled mass of hair slowly drags behind the hunched figure, and the sour odor of swamp-rot and dead fish lingers in the air. Whatever foul manner of beast is creeping about in the night, he must warn the others. He reaches for his flute, but it's gone.

The sound of heavy boots upon the ship's deck awakens Talorin, the halfling groggily rubbing his eyes. He wrinkles his nose, the strange odor settling into the darkened corner that he had chosen for his nap.

Outside he can hear more and more feet making their way across the ship, moving in quick strides. Silently, he moves to the set of stairs leading to the deck, poking his head out to see the commotion. It is then that he sees the same wizard backing toward the side of the ship and fumbling through pockets.
 
"Hey, it's you!" he exclaims, small hand pointing toward the man. "You disappeared in the tavern before I could introd-" A dirty hand grasps Talorin by the topknot, pulling him to the ground. With a squeal of surprise, he clutches the pirate's arm, digging his nails into flesh. With the grasp loosed just enough, Talorin slips from the grip and scrambles to his feet, producing what to most would be a pen-knife. He holds it securely, eyes darting fervently as he moves to stand nearer the wizard.
 
"Of all the ships, why did THIS one need to be attacked by a bunch of boot-licking, centaur-dung-smelling, greasy-haired pirates!"
 
Retreating quickly and allowing himself enough room, the kender places the knife in a pocket and quickly reaches to his back, loosening his hoopak and holding it firmly. He begins twirling forked stick, a shrill wail emitting from the weapon.

The ruins of Mycaisa are precariously balanced upon the jagged edge of a black fissure. It cuts deep into the darkness of the sea, and as the dilapidated buildings succumb to age and neglect, they tumble one by one into the hungry abyss and are swallowed up.

The village was once the resting place of weary travelers and tradesmen, especially during the days when the gods were silent and Dimernesti feared voyaging by way of the Defiler's Breath. But, the volcanic vapors that now ooze from the gaping gash in the earth have poisoned the waters around Mycaisa, rendering it dark and silent. Now, elves shun the wretched ruins and whisper of its curse.

Osseus had passed near Mycaisa many times, and always the ash had burned his gills and spurred him away. But, as he navigated around its tainted waters on a night in mid-summer, he thought he heard voices singing in the distance. Pausing a moment, he listened.

Holding his breath and gathering his courage, the sea-elf flipperkicked into the stale, stagnant waters, unstirred for years. Drawing closer, the voices became more distinct, and he found himself braving the stinging waters till he arrived a very old building, teetering upon the doomed edge of the gaping pit.

The foolish elf's head reeled with toxins and his skin felt on fire, but he was transfixed by the tranquil voices, singing like sirens in the shadows. Their words were elven and honey.

"We sang for the Kingpriests in the golden times, and we sing for them still. But, we are soon lost." In a corner of the crooked room, something shimmered beneath a broken pillar of coral. It was a crown.

Wrapped in entwining patterns, the crown seemed wrought of solid gold. It was bejeweled in flawless rubies as red as blood. Without thinking, the sea-elf placed the crown upon his head, and in that instant the voices burst forth with startling intensity, ringing in his skull. The darkness had also grown so overwhelming that the low-hanging passage through which he had entered had now completely vanished. His eyes burned with acid, and unable to see, Osseus groped along the walls till he was free.

Cursing his curiosity, Osseus sped from the forgotten ruins until his muscles ached. The water became breathable, but the darkness of Mycaisa still surrounded him. He held out a webbed hand before his face, and a wave of despair fell over him. Osseus had lingered too long in the shunned city. The poison had blinded him.

"Though you cannot see," sang the elven voices, "we shall lead you."

Lights shone in Istar as the Great Temple glowed crimson, heralding its new Kingpriest. And from Istar now comes the strange message upon the lips of traders.

"The Crown of Power has been found. The Holy Empire is reborn."

Leorxes: Lights Over Wayreth [I]
Wed Feb 11 02:27:20 2009
To: Conclave
A strange array of lights hovers over Wayreth for all mages approaching 
to see. As you first enter the courtyard, the lights reflect magnificently 
off of any and all surfaces surrounding you. The source is unseen, but not 
unheard; a dull hum is heard in the distance. The volume gets louder as 
elevation increases and the White Tower grows closer. The stairs up the 
Tower of Solinari glow the brightest, as if the sun itself is above each 
step. At the top stands a lone mage, his white robes open and his arms 
spread. His eyes are wide open and completely glazed over crystal blue. 
The sound does not stem from his lips, but illuminates from his body; 
he appears to be in a state of trance, perhaps harmony.

Rain.  The sky was dark, and rain fell from the skies.  The cold pattering
of raindrops was soothing to me.  It almost felt as if though the water
would wash away the anxiety I had felt.
 
I found myself dragging a boat across the sands of an island off of the
coast near Palanthas.  I bought it from a local fisherman for a decent
price.  I intended to go out for some sailing on the ocean.  I decided
that it was the best way to calm my nerves after what had happened to
me not to long ago.
 
You see, I had taken a great responcibility on my shoulders.  Call it the
will of the gods, or call it a knight's ambition to ensure that no harm
comes to innocents.  I call it a curse, now.  I'm not going to go into
much detail here, but there are things that I must safeguard.  Things that
by this curse must never leave my side.  Not too long ago, they had
almost done so, and a black plague would have spread once more.
 
I moved away from the shore, dragging the boat with me and going waist
deep into the water.  I then climbed into the wooden vessel as best I
could without getting much water in it.  I picked up the oars inside
and began to row out to sea, closing my eyes and letting my heart take
me where it would.
 
Hours passed.  The sun set over the horizon and the moon had raised well
into the sky.  The rain still lightly poured, giving me a strange sense
of security.  I finally opened my eyes to take a look around.  From any
direction I stared to, all I could see was ocean.  This would be perfect
for me.
 
I removed a backpack from my shoulders and placed it infront of me.  I
began to search through the enchanted backpack, whose size was a lot
larger on the inside then it was on the outside.  I pulled from within
it three things; a halberd, a sword, and some rope.  I then closed the
backpack and placed it on my shoulders, tightening it so it would stay
close.
 
I took the halberd in my left hand and the rope in my right.  I began
to tie the item firmly to me, using several knots and looping the rope
around my hand several times.  Once I felt confident in the stability
of the rope, I picked up the sword.  I could lightly see my reflection
in the clean blade from what little light there was.  The importance
of these two things was so grave, it almost seemed unreal to me.  How
stupid it was that such things boiled things down to this.
 
I slowly stood up to the best of my ability, trying not to cause the
boat to tip over.  Once I had found my balance, I looked up at the dark
night sky.  I closed my eyes and allowed the water to hit my face.  Rain.
I loved the rain.  Rain was always my favorite part of the natural world.
 
I knew it had to be done.  I wispered, "Est Sularas oth Mithas," to the
night sky.  Knowing my duty, I punctured the sword through my chest.  I
almost immediatly felt the metallic tang of blood in my mouth.  I smiled.
I remembered one time telling a young boy looking to be a knight that I
had been looking for an escape as a knight for a long time.  Of course then,
I was joking.  I could never predict that something so important would boil
it down to this.
 
I felt my body fall from the boat and crash into the water.  The weight of
my armor began to drag me down into the clutches of the ocean.  I could
still hear the rain pattering on the surface of the water for a while.
Soon enough, however, there was nothing.  Conciousness faded.  My mind
slipped away.  I could only guess that soon after my soul passed on; that,
or it was bound eternally to protect the weapons that had been so dangerous
to the bottom of the sea.  Whatever works, I suppose.  I never did like
endings like this.  Figures that would be mine.

Silent footsteps carried him up the stone steps of the Temple Altar. 
Shading his eyes from the bright light before him, a soft sigh escaped his
barely parted crimson lips as he offered the attending Clerica nod of his
head in greeting.  "{mCome to pray, Child?  {x" Came the question from the
Cleric, a smile gracing his lips.  - "{DI do not know how.  {x" Was his
simple answer.  "{DI have long since forgotten how.  {x" He made his way
over to stand before the statue of the God Paladine, and bowed his head
respectfully, unsure of how to act.  Shuffling his feet, he stared up into
the great eyes of the God, and, looking back to make sure the Cleric was out
of earshot, opened his mouth to utter soft words.  "{DThe path that I am
expected to travel is a hard one.  The role of a blumbering idiot that I
have assumed suits me well, for I feel that I am fumbling in the darkness. 
{x" He sighed heavily, and raised a clenched fist to his heart.  "{DI do not
wish to harm others, I do not wish to end the lives of innocent men, woman
and children...  I am destined for such a life, but...  Can a man truly
change the words written in the book of fate?  {x" He asked, staring up at
the Statue.  He waited long minutes before sighing yet again, and turning on
heel before walking away.  Paladine would be no help in his moral dilema -
the Goddess in his dreams had assured him of such.

Staring out from the northern gate of Thorbardin, Simo thought back on the last two years. He thought of his time beneath the mountain, staying with Hamar Steelforge and his wife. Holding the dual short swords Hamar had forged for him, Hamars final works, he stepped out into the cool night and headed down the mountainside making his way to Qualinesti.
Two days later, as he approached the edge of the forest, a quiet voice, a voice that carried despite its volume, rang out from just behind the trees in elven, "{GTurn back human. Your kind are not welcome in this forest.{x"
Not one for volume, Simo whispered, also in elven, "{bI am no human, and by your accent, you are not of the Qualinesti, so you are as unwelcome as I. Stand aside.{x"
A lithe elf dropped from the trees, clad only in a loincloth and holding a thick stick, carved with images of an elven woman and a unicorn. "{GI protect the forest, not the inhabitants. Humans bring destruction, Ill not have you in this forest.{x"
Simo, straightening, sheathed his dual swords into their single sheath, "{bIve no intention to harm this forest or any of its inhabitants, again I say, stand aside.{x"
"{GI am Sillva Aspenbranch, protector of this forest. You shame your elven blood. Prepare to die.{x"
************************************************************
As Simo cleaned Sillvas blood off his blades, he marveled at Hamars ability in the forge. He passed through the forest without further incident, staying close to the eastern edge, making his way to Solace. -{bI should visit Kaitlin, It has been two years since I last saw her,{x- he thought as he snuck through the borders of the forest.
Four days later, as he cleared the forest, he came upon a man lying on a rock, apparently asleep. Having no quarrel with the man, he snuck past, only to freeze at the words, "{dFor an elf, you sure make a lot of noise.{x"
Simo whirled around to face the man, swords drawn, sizing up his opponent. The man stood near 6 feet tall, and his mohawk must have added another foot on top of that. The swords strapped all over his body glinted in the sunlight, no two the same. His heavily muscled torso was bare, save a buckler on his right shoulder, and a tattoo of an intertwining rose and lily around an axe on his left.
"{dSay now, those are pretty fancy swords you got there, custom job? I dont suppose youd part with them?{x" the man said, holding out a sack of coins.
Simo, silent, shook his head and tightened his grip on the blades.
"{dNo matter, Im taking the swords either way, I was just giving you a sporting chance to walk out of here,{x" said the man, drawing an incredibly long, almost spear-like sword from behind his back.
Simo crouched into a battle stance, prepared for the coming fight. The man yelled, "{dJust remember, I gave you a chance elf!{x" With that, he lunged forward, thrusting the long blade directly at Simo. But Simo saw It coming, he deftly slipped to the left to avoid the long blade and raised his own sword, preparing to attack. Before he had a chance, the man dropped his left hand from the sword, reached up, and plunged a knife, concealed in the buckler, into Simos abdomen.
Simo fell to the ground, dropped his blades, and clutched his wound, trying to stem the flow of blood. The fight was over as quickly as it had begun. The strange man picked up the swords, looking at them fondly, "{dYoure not worthy of beauties like these. Here I wouldnt want to leave you weaponless, even if you are a deadman.{x"
With that, he dropped the knife he had just stabbed Simo with in the dirt in front of him. He crouched down, grinning cruelly in the face of the defeated half-elf, "{dNames Mariek. If you survive this and want your swords back, come find me, prove your worth.{x" As Simo lapsed into unconsciousness, the last thing he remembered was the grinning face of the man.

Along a cliff next to a sea hides a small cave; growth from the wilderness reigns supreme. Down in the cave, man-made objects have been erected; a cheap looking altar and a platform to sit at. On the platform lies sprawled out, Rylinthai. Seemingly carefree, the woman seems to not be paying any attentiong to her surroundings.
 "{cYeah. It has been a while since I came here. Sorry.{x" Rylinthai's words resonate off the walls in the small cave. Swiftly rising from her position into a sitting position, Rylinthai says "{cBut I'm already doing the best I can.{x" A hint of disappointment and anger linger in her voice. After long moments of the silence except for the lapping of the waves ever ravaging the rocks far below.
Uncerntaintly leaves Rylinthai's face in a moment, a bit of a smile cracks open on her face. "{cAnd I assume you need me for something?{x" After a long period time passes with only the sea giving off any signs of life, Rylinthai asks with a confused tone "{cSo, I'm suppose to find for you a being that may or may not exist that you can't locate yourself and prevent this being from using a force that is beyond your comprehension?
I'm sorry, you put too much faith in me.{x" Rylinthai's attempt to hide herself behind such words comes out weak and feebish. Sour looks bubble up to the surface as Rylinthai seems to burdened with a task outside of her hands. "{cAlright, I'll use them. They arn't worthy of serving you though. Ungrateful and bli...{x" Cutting off in mid-sentence, Rylinthai stares blankly at the make-shift altar.
Breathing in deep, Rylinthai lets out a deep sigh. "{cI guess I should go figure this out.{x" Gathering some random things that lie next to the platform, Rylinthai leaves the small cave; rythmatic waves forever continue to pound the cliff wall.

Not yet consumed by dark

draped in the purest of white turned and said nothing.  A young man
materialized then, strong and powerful.  He wore the aura of righteous
warfare.  Beside him, a younger man materialized.  This young man was hale
and hearty.  He looked carefree and boisterous.  {WWe have a conundrum
before us my sons.  {y The two young men looked upon each other.  {W Our
Knighthood has fallen lax and into disarray.  There is no more law.  There
is no more honor.  There is no more justice.  There is no more loyalty. 
What we have bore from the very boosum of our chest is no more.  What shall
we do?  {y The older man fell quiet now, waiting for an answer.  {YIs there
no one to stand for what is just and right father?  {y the older looking
young man said.  {WNo more.  {y The first fell silent.  {CNone shall hold to
the Oath and Measure?  {y The older man turned then and looked at his second
youngest child.  His eyes filled with sadness.  {WNot since the reign of
Kaillen Darkwinde.  {y All were quiet now.  All turned now and gazed down
into the darkness as images of the dirty, unkept Solamnic Knight training
grounds came to light.  {WThere is one of my own I would see walk the lands
once.  But I will not return him without a consensus.  {y And now all
turned, looking upon the older man in concern and confusion.  {WHe was a man
of great honor, fallen into dishonor and then reborn once more under Kaillen
Darkwinde.  {y All seemed even more confused now as they gazed upon him. 
{YWhat was his name?  {y asked the first oldest.  {WSebastian Quickblade. 
{y Now all turned.  {YNo father.  {C He has not set foot on that plane for
too long.  Too much has changed.  {Y You could not expect him to remember
everything.  {WBut we could give him back what he has lost!  {y the older
man boomed now.  The two younger men shrank before their father.  {YIs this
wise?  {W Do we have a choice?  The Knights must rise once more and reclaim
their former glory!  {C How shall we do it?  The Dark Queen and her minions
would not fear his might.  {YDo we expect that?  {W No, none need fear him. 
I can give him his corporeal body back.  The two of you can offer his
memories to him.  {Y Is this wise?  {C We have no choice.  I will do what I
must.  {W And will you, eldest of mine?  {y There was a long pause in the
discussion now.  The eldest of the young considered his options and finally
nodded.  {YAll of his memories?  {y There was silence once more.  {BThat is
the moral decission we must make my child.  {y came a soft and pleasant
voice.  The woman - quiet until now - stood and gently caressed her sons
cheek.  {BIf it be what this man needs, then this man must remember the pain
he felt at death.  He learned from his mistakes, and from this your father
was able to reclaim him proudly from the Dark Queen.  {y The eldest of the
young became silent once more.  A solemn nod.  The armored man stood and
clapped his hands together.  A blinding flash of light errupted from the
heavens and spread down over the lands.  {x

His eyes open upon complete darkness. He does not breath. A flash of
light and his lungs fill with a gasping and painful air.  He sits up
straight and looks around.  His eyes pierce through the darkness as specs of
light cascade throughout his mind.  He shakes his head and lifts his hands
hazily to rub away something from his face that is not there.  Slowly he
crawls from something, his breathing still laboured and painful.  Another
flash of light and he falls to his knees, grasping his head in agony.  {YDo
not be afraid.  {x He looks up, his eyes buldging and tearing in pain. 
{cWhat is this?  {x {YThis is the pain of your life returning to you.  This
is your reawakening.  {x A whoosh of air and explosion of flame fill the
room as torches errupt into light.  He looks around now and recognition
comes to him.  The Quickblade family mausoleum.  {cNo!  No!  This can't be! 
{x He screamed into the cavernous room.  {CCalm yourself child.  {x
Something new in his head.  {cThis cannot be!  I am not supposed to be!  {x
He becomes angry now and draws his fist into the air, shaking it, {cDo not
play your petty tricks on me Chemosh!  {x He roars.  {YThis is no trick,
Sebastian Quickblade.  {C This is a reawakening for you are needed once
more.  {Y Yes, once more you are needed to be a Knight.  {x He calms now,
peering around the empty room.  {cI am always a Knight.  {CYes, and now it
is time you serve once more within the material plane.  {c Why me?  {Y Do
you question our judgement?  {c Not without respect.  {Y Then be fair to
know that what we have decided shall be done.  You are needed once more. 
The Knights are not in good array.  {C Yes, there is much disarray.  {c Who
bears the signet of the Grandmaster?  {Y None for one after your time took
the reigns and was then stolen by Chemosh.  {c Can he be redeemed?  {Y
Anyone can be redeemed.  {CYou of all people should understand redemption. 
{c I do.  {Y Go now, into the realm and seek out the Knighthood.  Return as
you once were and teach those without.  {C Show honor and mercy where none
had been before.  {Y Remember your past.  Your child is gone now. 
{CRemember your dishonor.  Remember your fall and the lessons learned on
your path to redemption.  {Y Remember your oath.  Remember our oath.  {C Do
not fail the Measure.  Balance must be restored.  A new danger threatens the
safety and peace of what once was.  {c Est Sularus oth Mithas.  {Y We should
hope so.  {C It is time, Sebastian Quickblade.  Bear the proud mantle of who
you were in life and in death.  {Y Return the glory of righteousness to the
Knighthood.  Return the glory of righteous warfare to the children of the
Knighthood.  {c I will.  {BThen it is time for you, Sebastian Quickblade. 
My sons have said all that they could have said.  Take my blessing and
return to who you once were.  {x All was peaceful in his mind then.  A soft
and warm feeling carressed his cheek and then the doors to the mausoleum
were thrown open with a loud and thunderous roar.  He stood quietly for
several long and quiet moments.  With shaking hands and unsteady feet, he
took his first steps back into the world.  {x

  |   I put pen to parchment in this eleventh watch, during the Day of       |
  | Nuindai, sixteenth month of Reorxmont to inform you of a sad tiding.     |
  | Gone are the heraldries of old. The Archives seem to have lost their     |
  | flair and touch. For this reason, I scribe to you the description of the |
  | Quickblade family crest.                                                 |

  |   The Quickblade Family Crest is born on a bi-parted tower shield. The   |
  | shield rests upon a midnight blue background, coloured silver showing    |
  | purity. The line quartering the shield is of the same midnight blue      |
  | colour. It draws diagonally from top right to bottom left. Upon the upper|
  | half of the shield is a longsword with the swirls of speed, the crest    |
  | of the Quickblade family. Upon the bottom half of the shield is a golden |
  | heart wreathed in flame and crowned. The wreathed heart shows the faith  |
  | we burn into our hearts for the Oath and Measure. The crown signifies the|
  | nobility from which we strive to maintain.                               |
  |                                                                          |
  |   As for the standards, I have placed two swords - point down - crossed  |
  | and behind the shield to signify my rank as Lord of Swords. And from this|

  | family crest as well. I wish you good tidings and easy reading.          |

{yThe smell of death filled the area, it was strong and would overtake any normal being. Most gruesome sights of bloodied corpses and zombified creatures walking alongside skeletal warriors and mages. Blood covered almost all parts of every figure, with some gruesome, horrific look to them, each having a unique story to share. But silence gripped the mountain known as Dargaard, and the warriors of Undeath remained calm, unafraid...they did not know, what lurked within the shadows of their sanctuary.
A grey figure stalked through the mountains, his footsteps unheard by the minions of Aeleth. The wind was blowing furiously, muffling the silent shadow's steps through the muddy, blood stained mountain. Rain began to sweep across the mountain, it began to pour harder than the mountain has ever received before. The combination of rain and wind was beginning to cause an uproar within the sanctuary of Undeath.
Moans and cries of anger erupted from the Army of Slaves, their obvious unwant for the storm befalling them.
"{rWhy must the Maelstrom choose to exact her fury at a time like this.{y" The grey figure whispered to himself as rain and harsh winds seemed to furiously attack him. He no longer chose to keep his voice silenced, considering the storms muffling powers. "{rAlthough, maybe the Dark Divine does such for a reason, to guide me perhaps.{y" A sinister chuckle soon follows the last set of words as the grey figure realizes no such thing would happen to the likes of him.
The grey figure snuck onward, pausing at random intervals as troupes of skeletal warriors patrolled the area. His caution was great while he walked among the army of the dead, for he knew the massive numbers against only he would be his downfall. He did not fear the army, but he wasn't dumb either, he refused to try and do something he knew he couldn't accomplish. He continued onward until his journey finally led him to the entrance to the Caverns of the Undead.
He waited at the entrance behind a large dead tree that stood before the entrance, swaying heavily to the side due to the extreme winds, it's massive shape blocking the entrance. The grey figure thought for moments as to how would would get through this entrance, and without being noticed. He couldn't easily sneak in even by cover of darkness, and the caves intense shadows. The tree posed an obstacle, one he had to overcome if he was to ever accomplish his goal.
The grey figure decided he would take a chance, and risk everything on a simple loud crack. He pulled out his form of a whip. A bloodied, human intestine that seemed to have random specs of black upon it, obviously some sort of disease. The intestine reeked heavily of the smell of death, and disease as the grey figures hand tightened around the end of it, blood dripping from the pressure, onto the cold, wet mountain.
The grey figure swung the whip around one of the smaller branches of the swaying tree, and watches as the intestine curled around it with ease. He soon gave the bloodied whip a hard tug and watched as the branch snapped with a loud CRACK and a pathway was made. He paused...His eyes flickered from the tree to his surrounding, seeking for enemies that could have heard the tree's explosive noise, even through the tempestuous storm.
Once he knew for sure that he was safe, he made his way through the open pathway, into the Caverns of Death.He climbed over the sideways tree, and pushed twigs and branches from his path as he shimmied through the created pathway, onward into the caverns. But when he fell to the ground, his feet landing gracefully, and without a sound, his eyes fell upon a skeletal warrior, standing before him, sword in hand, an evil grin upon his face.
A dark, cold whisper emanated from the skeletal beings mouth, barely detectable because of the echo of the winds from the storm outside. "{DWhhhyyyy, do you come here Wretch, of the living{y?" The skeleton cried as his skull moved upward and downward as he inspected the grey figure before him.
"{rI bear a message, it is from H'rar{y." The grey figure replied, his own sinister voice reverberating off the damp, dripping walls of the cavern. Even the skeletal being, upon hearing the voice, had a chill course through it, even with his workings of death, and pure evil, fear gripped him when the figure spoke. Although fear gripped the skeleton, it served Aeleth to the fullest, "{DWhat, messsssssssage is that{y?"
The grey figure did not utter a word, he merely once more flicked his hand and the intestine reacted to his bidding. It shot forward, and wrapped itself around the skeletal warrior's neck. Upon doing so, the figure refused to allow the warrior to act, and he yanked the intestine with a burst of strength flowing through his muscles, allowing the skeletal being to dismember easily.
The skeletal figure fell to the cavern floors with a loud thud that reverberated through the caverns, and a loud clang as it's sword landed upon one of the bones. The skull still spoke, even in it's current form, "{DYou think you can stop ussssss?{y" The skull now grew louder as anger flowed through it, "{DWE ARE DEATH'S ARMY, WE CANNOT BE DEFEATED!!!{y"

{yThe laughter kept going and going, the intensity of it amplified because of the reverberation effect of the caverns, the laughter trailing deeper inward. A yell erupts just before the laughter stops, and a patrol of warriors arrive to see the commotion, swords and spears in hands. "{RYou shall all see!{y" One final set of laughter fills the area before the grey figure can no longer be detected, and silence grips the caverns.
 The skeletal warriors look around, in hopes of finding the intruder, but to no avail. All they could find was a message, scribed in blood upon the walls of the cavern. "{ROur eyes are upon you!{y" The crimson message was sloppily, and rushed, but was still eligible enough that the message could be made out. "{DGO FIND THE DREAD LORD...NOW!!!{y"

A young male was walking down a dirt path, admiring the beauty of the woodlands, allowing himself to become one with the peace and quiet surrounding him. He had been walking for hours, embracing the sun, enjoying it's light, it's warmth, it's flames. He continued onward undistrubed by anything except the creatures that inhabited the forest.
A sudden disturbance sickened him. He had allowed himself to close his eyes, the path straight, knowing he wouldn't stray off from his walkway. When the strong, overpowering stench of smoke met with his nostrils his eyes shot open, his deep green eyes scanning the area, trying to find the source of the smell.
He increased his pace to a jog, and continued toward a black gas that had risen to view over the canopy of trees. His mind began to race with thoughts, "{rWhat's happened? Who could have let something like this happen? This only proves that people shouldn't play with something they know nothing about.{x" Numerous thoughts echoed within his head as he hurriedly continued towards the smoke.
The problem grew as he neared the smoke. He began to get to a point where the trees overtook his sight of the grey and black horror. Another thought raced through his mind, "{rOh my, Which way do I go?{x" He had to leave the path he was previously on and in doing so he had gotten himself lost. "{rPlease let this be a small campfire. Please be under control.{x" The man's thoughts began to bombard him, he knew that the amount and color of the smoke meant that it wasn't under control, but he still hoped.
"{GYou! Come help!{x" A loud voice erupted, breaking the man's thoughts. As he turned around his eyes fell upon a small elven male. He was covered in leather armor and a bow adorned his back alongside a quiver of what seemed to be perfectly made arrows. "{GYes, you!!{x" The voice came again as the ranger grew impatient. "{RMe? What is it?{x" The man asked, confused. His mind was racing about the smoke and he wasn't entirely focused.
"{GThere is a disaster near our encampment, we are in need of assistance. Will you please help us?{x" The elf exclaimed hurriedly as he wanted to get back to the fire. "{RLead the way!{x" The man said as he realized his hopes were false. More thoughts raced through his head as the elf led him through thickets of brush and bushes, "{rIt can't be, they couldn't have let it get out of control...Surely the elves would have better care than this.{x"
As the pair entered a small clearing the man's eyes fell upon a small group of ten or eleven Foresters attending to a raging forest fire. The flames were crawling across the trees, pullin everything near into it's desolating grasp. "{ROh my...{x" The man was unable to finish his own sentence as a bucket was thrust into his hands. "{GHelp put the flames out, and hurry! There's water over there!{x"
The elven ranger said as his hand shot up and his finger pointed  to a a geyser of water that was erupting into the air, causing water to flood a small area, creating a pond. Many of the other elves were pouring water onto various areas of the flame, returning to the created pond to refill their makeshift buckets and pails
The man joined in the work and began filling his bucket and running to the flames, pouring the liquid at the base of the fire. He saw a large barbarian throwing water, spraying it wide, it's effect on the flame miniscule. His thoughts were, "{rWhat is he doing? He knows nothing of fire.{x" He yelled to the gargantuan elf as they were runnning back to the pool of water, "{RPour the water on the base of the flame. It's not helping if you just toss it anywhere!{x" The barbarian wordlessly acknowledged him.
The elven ranger yelled aloud to everyone as he returned to the pond, "{GWe have to move faster, the flames are going to reach the village if we don't hurry!!{x" As the words reached the human, he began to worry. He knew that their tiny group would not be enough to control this raging fury of flames. "{rI must do something...I have to stop this.{x" He thought as he dropped his bucket and slowly walked towards the raging flames.
"{GWhat are you doing?! Get back here!!!{x" The ranger yelled at the man as he drew closer to the flames. As the ranger yelled, all of the others seemed to stop working and turned to look at the man walking towards the furious flames. "{rI must stop this.{x" He thought to himself as he grew closer to the intense heat of the fire. Sweat began to form heavily, and fall all about his skin as he continued, closer and closer towards the flames. He began to pray, to his deity...Sirrion, The Flowing Flame.
"{bFlowing Flame of creation and passion. I call upon you, as your pupil, your cleric, in hopes you will aid me in my time of need. My path to becoming your High Priest has set a task upon me I cannot complete without your guidance, and without your help. These elves have set loose a flame, an uncontrolled flame that will kill many if not stopped. They are ignorant of the disastrous effects a fire can have. Please aid me, and I will teach them of the respect for fire, and all it's capabilities{x"
The prayer finished, the cleric opened his eyes and looked into the flames, hoping that the massive heat would die down, and the onslaught of fire would come to an end. Time passed, seconds felt like minutes, and minutes felt like years, but eventually they were answered. A section of the flames seemed to form what looked like the face of a bald man. The cleric gasped in complete shock, his god had answered his prayers.

"{YMy child, my devout cleric. Your prayers have reached me. What is it you seek?{x" The flaming figure spoke, a sense of calm, and control was about it's voice. The flaming figure stared at the cleric, awaiting the answer. But the answer took long to form, for the cleric was utterly shocked that he was graced with the presence of his deity.
"{RThese elves know not of your teachings, and have unleashed a flame that will destroy many, and kill more if not contained. I need your guidance, your assistance in calming these flames.{x"
"{RI will teach these elves of your ways, and teach them the respect for fire. And they shall learn that fire is not just an instrument of warmth and light, but it is creation, it is devastation and they will learn to treat it as more than a simple thing they believe it is. I will spread your word, and in turn all I ask is for aid.{x"
The figure nods slowly, and speaks in his calm voice, "{YMy child, teach these elves of fire. It's capabilities, it's strength, it's purpose. And I shall aid your path and calm these flames. They shall learn to respect the flame, and to learn it can be used for good. Teach them, to be fearless of fire, and to control it always...and let them know, every flame has a purpose.{x"
The figure faded into the flames as the final set of words was finished. Time was not given for a reply from the cleric, for as soon as the figure disappeared the heat wave of the flames seemed to end. And the air thickened, returning to normal. Flames decreased, a wind blew, and the flames slowly, but surely died to nothing but ashes and embers.
"{bThank you my lord. Your teachings shall reach these elves. Their second chance shall not be wasted.{x" The cleric prayed as he watched the raging fury die to nothingness. He turned to face the group of elves who were all covered with shock, and a sense of dumbness. The calm voice of Sirrion echoed throughout the cleric's mind, "{YYou have done well my child...Soon, you shall be rewarded for your faith.{x"
The voice faded, and the cleric began to walk towards the elves who were now cheering and dancing, running to the cleric praising him. He called out to them all, "{RListen, for I bear words, you must hear. Knowledge you must gain, it is vital, and it begins now.{x" With these last words, the cleric set about the teachings of Sirrion, and sharing them with the elves, making sure they learned every aspect that was instructed.
And to this day, a fire has not raged in the woodlands of Qualinesti.

Text
The trees of the forest rustle in the gentle wind, the leaves falling all around.  The small creatures of the forest scamper upon the forest floor, avoiding the kagonesti that slowy strolls though the dense forest.
"{YWear is that damn place, all I see are trees.{x"
His eyes dart back and forth, from tree to tree, bush to bush. He continues to examine everything, as if he is searching for something. His sword clangs inside it's sheath with every step. The bard continues to survey the land, his bright blue eyes roaming over every bit of the forest he can see. His eyes stop moving, focused on something, He pick up the pace and runs towards the object.
"{YIs this really it?{x"
He runs over to the area of focus and stops suddenly, a look of achievment on his face.
"{YI think I finally found it. The entrance into my family's tomb.{x"
The bard looks up to see a thick branch hanging overhead, and jumps up to grab it. He swings his body back and forth and begins to swing on the branch. He lets go of the branch tossing himself over the thick brush and almost face first into a large boulder. A faint, cool breeze escapes the boulder, as if there is an entrance behind it. Linx attempts to push the boulder oput of the way, but fails to even budge the tramendously heavy object.
"{YHoly shit, this thing is heavy.{x"
He begins to rumage through his pack, hoping to find something useful. He pulls out a thick peice of rope.
"{YThis might work...{x" 
He ties the rope around the boulder, and tosses the other end over a thick branch. He pulls on the rope, but the boulder doesn't budge. He continues to pull on the rope, but the branch snaps, and falls down on the bard. He lets out a small sigh and examines the boulder to find that there is some kind of inscription carved into it.
"{DOnly those who have orven themselves to the family may enter this sacred tomb.{x"
Linx studies the inscription carefully, and places his hand on the boulder.
"{YSo, I have proven myself, so why can I not still move this damn thing?{x"
Linx stands up and with a slight shrug begins to push on the boulder as hard as he can. His face going bloodshot, and his feet digging into the ground, the boulder finally budges. It slowly creeps out of the way, Linx's blood vessels seemingly about to explode in his face. 
"{YBy...the gods....{x"
Linx stops pushing the boulder and falls to the ground, exausted. He looks up at the boulder and looks past into the tight squeeze of an opning.
"{YI should be able to fit through there.{x"
Linx takes a deep breath and climbs to his feet. He slowly stumbles into the gap, obviously exausted, and almost falls flat to his face.
"{YI think I might have to take a nap, I can't move my arms...{x" 
His words fall short as he falls asleep. 
 
Linx awakes to the sound of the trees flailing back and forth in the wind. He peek outside the entrance to see that the sky is black and a heavy rain falls from the clouds. Lighting flashes in the sky and the thunder echoes loudly through the small tomb. Linx gathers himself and climbs to his feet. He looks around and begins to walk deeper into the tomb. His eyes look around at the many caskets that line the halls.
"{YI'm curious as to how long my family has actually been around, and I am curious as to who the first person was that started us.{x"
Linx continues to walk, down the never ending hall of the tomb. The cobblestones at his feet worn away form hundreds years of erosion and decay. A light seems to glowe faintly frmo the end of the hall, and the bard picks up his pace and begins to run towards the light. His sword clangs at his side as he comes to a quick stop at the end of the hallway, the door in front of him left slighty ajar. He slowly opens the door and peeks inside to see a tall sarcophagus, made from gold.
 Hanging at it's side is a small golden harp. Linx slowly walks over to the wall and picks the harp off the wall, only to see an inscription carved into the wall;
"{DBrave young music lover, protect what you hold close, and use the power if this instrument to help guide you in your journies. Bring the harp back, and rest it upon the pedastal when the time comes for you to lay in your eternal resting place.{x"
Linx holds the harp in his hands and lightly strums the string, a soothing hum begins to eminate from the harp, and echo through the room. He lowers the harp, turns and walks out the door only to return back to the library he holds close.

  |   I put pen to parchment in this eleventh watch, during the Day of       |
  | Nuindai, sixteenth month of Reorxmont to inform you of a sad tiding.     |
  | Gone are the heraldries of old. The Archives seem to have lost their     |
  | flair and touch. For this reason, I scribe to you the description of the |
  | Quickblade family crest.                                                 |

  |   The Quickblade Family Crest is born on a bi-parted tower shield. The   |
  | shield rests upon a midnight blue background, coloured silver showing    |
  | purity. The line quartering the shield is of the same midnight blue      |
  | colour. It draws diagonally from top right to bottom left. Upon the upper|
  | half of the shield is a longsword with the swirls of speed, the crest    |
  | of the Quickblade family. Upon the bottom half of the shield is a golden |
  | heart wreathed in flame and crowned. The wreathed heart shows the faith  |
  | we burn into our hearts for the Oath and Measure. The crown signifies the|
  | nobility from which we strive to maintain.                               |

  | and behind the shield to signify my rank as Lord of Swords. And from this|
  | parchment, I hope that you will restore my families crest into the       |

The evening {Ysun{  set gently over the horizon. The last rays of light retreating from the winding rows of buildings that make up the great city of Palanthas. The bakery was just emptying of its final customers of the day. Bags filled with pot pies and loaves of bread being brought home to fill the bellies of waiting families.
The Baker milled about performing his final chores of the day: cleaning the oven, scrubbing the granite countertops, and emptying the display case of its stale contents. The Baker pauses and glances worriedly at the door as the last patron exits. Alone. The part of the day he dreaded most. It hasn't always been this way he remembered.
 Only a month before he thanked Paladine when the day of work was concluded. But since the day the young man approached him about the offer for usage of a spare storage cellar, things had changed. A simple deal. Fifty steel a week and you can come and go as you please. There is only an entrance in the back, so it wouldn't even disturb his place of business.
Easy money. He let out a chuckle at the thought. Then his mind snapped back to the moment he walked back to the cellar entrance. The meeting he interrupted. The things he shouldn't have seen. "I know to much..." He whispered to himself. Losing his concentration he dropped a hard dinner roll off of a tray. It falls to the floor with a thud and rolls beneath the counter coming to rest under the crawlspace.
Cursing under his breath he debates leaving it. Then thinks of the rats thanking him for the feast he left them and reconsiders. The Baker, a very portly man, squats down to his hands and knees to accomodate the cramped space and begins squeezing forward. The roll came to rest at the very back of the enclosure. His outstretched hand still out of reach, he inches forward to grasp the baked good.
Suddenly the silence of the room is broken. The bells affixed above the entrance that alert him that customers have arrived when he is tending the oven or, on a slow day, taking a nap ring loudly. The Baker freezes up in fear and remains motionless, deafened by the pounding pulse of blood in his head. "I'm sorry we're closed!" the Baker managed to yell.
Even muffled from underneath the counter, the terror in his voice was clearly audible. No answer. The Baker's mind was racing and sweat poured from every pore.He began slowly inching backwards to free himself from the cramped prison. The sound of footsteps made him freeze again. But these were not steps from feet. More like steps from a horse. And from the sounds of the floorboards creaking, a very large one. With his last ounce of strength the Baker pushed back hard.
Flinging himself free and falling onto his back into the gaze of two figures. "Please! I know nothing!" the Baker stammered. "From your death. We profit." The voice was harmonic almost. That night the rats thanked the baker for the feast he left them.

Blood trickled down into her red eyes, forming a pool welling up and spilling over her
coarse and rough skin, dribbling down her cheeks to cradle in the corner of her mouth, bringing
the taste of blood to her senses, arousing the stupor from which the Minotaur dwelled. Her mind reeled
bringing back reality as sharp as the sensation pounding in her skull, her thoughts and motion slowly
forming a cohesive reality.
 
"By Sargas I'll kill them all!" Emmalene roared, disoriented and dazed, still not sure of reality or
what she faced. As her eyes slowly focused, she shook her head and instantly regretted the action, 
it felt like an army had trodden on her skull on the way to battle.... and then the way back.
 
She didn't mind the taste of blood, it was bringing back more memories than the pain was, and
Emmalene quickly found herself ready to eject the bile from her stomach and the sensation of spinning
would not subside.  Poison was playing a part in this no doubt, but it isn't what put her in this situation to start.
No. It was all returning now, too quickly for comfort as once again she was forced to purge her gut until
nothing remained.
The wager had been a simple one.  Too simple, and she had been winning... such a fool. 
Her travels often took her far, and she had, if any Minotaur would call it that, a weakness for gambling.
A puny bunch of humans too rich for their own good, from Neraka, spent many hours priming her for this, their goal.
 
Amongst her people, Emmalene's bloodline was well known for its fine craftsmanship.  There were a fair share whom 
were warriors, and even a champion amongst them in recent generations, but Ss'ssinring bloodline shone
when it came to Smithing.  Many a moon had been spent negotating with outsiders keen to own a weapon
or breastplate bearing their family seal. Legend had it that Mentarn the Great, legendary forefather of their bloodline
had perfected his craftsmanship to make weapons that could face the harshest of conditions, and remain
true to their construction and quality. Unbreakable, it was said. Not so the will of the youngest of their
legacy, it would seem.
Many told Emmalene it was folly to mix business with pleasure, when it came to dealing with the humans, even
those who served the Dark Queen... Now she would come to believe that not all humans were as stupid as
she wanted to believe.
 
The drinks flowed as the wagers increased, Emmalene's luck never running on dry, like the dark meads and spirits
that flowed like winter rains. She could'nt believe her luck, or shouldnt have.  Twenty drinks later, and
a fat pile of steel in front of her, she was ready to end this victory over human stupidity.... And the world
crashed around engulfing her in darkness and pain as blow after blow rained down as she fell under the stupor 
of the chemicals.
"You, cow! Behave or I'll throw you overboard before we reach Palanthas" A surprisingly weak looking human 
yelled.
 
"P..Palanthas?? What is this!? 
Emmalene tried to comprehend just what fate would bring... The holy city!
"I warned you" the frail man said, and with that the world crashed down once more. gulls cried their greedy
moans as waves stuck time and again over the bow. She could not resist the black.

OOC part one is post 173
 
Whispers entered into her dreams, the long fingers of magic rousing her memories and consciousness.
Emmalene became aware that she was far from reality, yet active within this dream world she languished. 
Sand appeared all around her, with a bleakish red sky washing everything with a blood tinged glow, the vacant landscape seemingly endless,  it was a truly bleak and foreboding image that struck the Minotaur with a sense of dread, and hopelessness.
 
"Where...what is this place?"  Emmalene felt lost and the instant urge to move, which was a fruitless task as heavy manacles shackled her fast to the spot in which she rest. 
"Have I finally died? Is this the Abyss?" the thought sending shivers down her spine.
a voice replied "No, although the image is of your own doing, not mine"
Emmalene turned every direction she could, trying to pinpoint the location of this voice.
 
A Dark robed figure made its way from the shadows in her mind, midnight coloured emblems adorning the silken cloth, holding a key made of gemstone, its craftsmanship ancient and beautiful, held in a skeletal hand. The cowl covering its face allowed no light to illuminate what lay beneath, and she wasn't quite sure that she wanted to see it anyway.
 
"Well, One of Sargas' and so far from home... destined for  the holy city no less! Oh how fate has a sense of humor...and irony" the voice was raspy and all around her.
 
"What manner of trickery is this? Who are you?" Emmalene boomed, "Have I gone completely mad?" 
 
"Far from it" It replied "Though if you reach your destination you may just wish you had...or worse" The figure glided over the blood stained sands and was almost within reach.
 
"Who are you? Where am I?" The Minotaur knew she was nowhere on Krynn, and wondered if this was just a dream.
 
Although she could not see his face, somehow she knew the figure was smiling 
"Where we are is far from everything, deep in your mind. It is prudent to say that this is our only chance to speak whilst you remain...where you are. Who I am you will come to know in due course..."
 
 
The sound of the ocean flushed all around her, and the sands beneath her feet changed into wooden boards beginning to take the familiar form of a ship.
 
"Hold still, there is not much time " the figure reached out and touched her forehead, a finger burning into her flesh, reaching inside.
 
Emmalene roared in pain and tried to move, but the chains tightened as walls began to construct themselves around her. She tried to wrench herself away from the hand, feeling it moving inside her skull.
 
"Be still fool if you want to live!" The figure hissed "Either they can kill you, or I kill you now if you waste any more of  my time! The finger pushed the key deep inside her skull.
The pain was unbearable, even for one such as a Minotaur, the blood curdling scream she let out in concert with the ever increasing sound of wood creaking and groaning against the booming thud and hiss of the ocean waves striking the ever forming planks around her, slowly reforming what she knew was reality, the hull of the ship she was in, destined to bring her to certain doom. 
She dare not move now, having no choice but to trust there was something to all of this.
 
Within a moment the finger withdrew and all pain instantly ended. "There, it is done!  Now listen my bovine friend and listen well, when you reach the bay you must free yourself before you reach the docks! Do you understand? For if you reach there all is for naught, and you will surely perish!"
Emmalene's head rolled, dizzy from the pain still, she managed to nod bluntly unable still to form words. She wanted to ask how, and it seemed the magi  could read her mind.
 
"You will know when the time comes, be careful those first few moments not to choke, it...."
The dark figure paused and seemed to sense something "Our time is up" 
 
The imagery around her quickly sharpened, and the magi vanished, leaving her falling into darkness once again, but knowing that soon the moment of reality would come, and then it would be time to {r act. {x.

Much time had passed in the cleric's bar since Aiyre had finished her last 
drink. The bar was empty, save for the waiter that was milling about the 
place as if he were expecting all of the inhabitants of Krynn to come by 
that night. She paid the waiter little attention however; as her focus was 
on a different matter.
 
Leaving some coins behind for the busy bodied waiter, Aiyre collected 
herself and left the bar. It was no longer day light out, the night swept in 
quickly, and with it, a cool eastwardly breeze. She strolled the streets of 
Palanthas alone that night; her body exhausted, her mind on over drive. 
 
An over abundance of Evil in the land is what had Quen Illumni's devout 
vexed. "Where are all of the followers of good, and light?" she thought to 
herself.  "The evil in Krynn will surely consume it, if it remains to be this 
way."
 
Aiyre paused briefly to assess her surroundings, when at that moment- 
something unexpected happened. A blinding white explosion of light 
nearly sent her sprawling backwards! 
 
When the light subsided, and Aiyre regained her composure, it was clear 
to her that she was no longer in Palanthas. She was now standing in a 
light colored marble courtyard peppered with light blue flowers, "The 
birthplace of all pleasant dreams," Aiyre thought.
 
Then, from behind her, came a soft, sweet and gentle voice, "Greetings, 
my little one."  She turned to see who the beautiful voice belonged to and 
to her suprise and awe, there stood the ever lovely Blue Lady.
 
"Mishakal!" Aiyre gasped, and quickly genuflected out of respect and 
devotion.  Mishakal smiled warmly and placed her hand upon Aiyre's 
shoulder.
 
"I know what troubles you, and you need not worry," said the beautiful 
Goddess as she guided Aiyre to her feet. "You must journey to the town of 
Solanthus, and seek out The Holy Order, from there you will know what to 
do."
 
And then, it was all gone- she was back, alone on the moon lit streets of 
Palanthas. A single tear danced down her cheek, a reminant from the 
Light Bringer's sheer beauty. 
 
"Solanthus it is, to seek out the Holy Order." Aiyre pondered deeply, 
perhaps from there she would be able to find others of  light to join in the
fight against evil, and the preservation of all that is good.

Dusk settles in on a quiet night on the Plains of Throt.  A small deer
scrounges through the dead shrubbery in a small clearing for something,
anything to eat in this lifeless land.  As the deer nibbles at a dead leaf,
suddenly the forest behind it springs to life.  A massive Ogre comes rushing
toward the deer from the brush followed closely by another and a primal
roar.  The deer with its quick wits dashes off like a coiled spring in the
blink of an eye, escaping the clutches of the small Ogre hunting party.  The
massive beasts let out a discouraging sigh as they watch this latest attempt
at food escape their clutches again.  One of the beasts, who has a wild scar
running from his face all the way down his chest, turns to his companion and
grunts in their savage tongue, "{RIt seems we go hungry again this night
Murklar, the Shaman will not be pleased{ ."  The other Ogre, whose name
appears to be Murklar turns to his much smaller companion and grunts back,
"{DYes, Mogrin, the Shaman will not be pleased, let us return to camp and
dwell on our next meal{ ."  The massive duo waddle slowly through the forest
dragging their massive weapons behind them like a child would drag his
blanky when he is pouting.  They approach the camp a short time later just
as the sun begins to settle behind the jagged peaks of Dargaard.  They
settle around the fire roaring in the camp center in preparation to bring
the bad news of another failure.  The Shaman, a much shorter and
equivilantly fat ogre with many strange marking and small bones piercing his
face at random intervals it would seem, slinks out of his tent, already
aware of the hunting party's failure.  He approaches the fire slowely and
just before he opens his mouth to speak a pair of dark armor clad soldiers
approach the perimeter of the camp and hesitantly the dismount and walk
toward the gathering ogre party.  The man riding in front, who appears to be
a middlish ranking officer, approaches the gathering, fear dripping from him
like the sweat dripping off his heavily armored back.  The man's voice
shakes as he speaks, "{WI have come to recruit Ogres for the Dark Queens
Army, who of you shall wield their axe in her service{ ?"  He looks around
at the silent Ogres and nods to his companion, speaking again he says
"{WLook at you bunch, you will not survive in this barren land without food.
I can give you this and much more if you would follow me into battle{ !" 
The Ogres look at each other confused and grunt to each other in their
savage language The two men look at each other and smile, feeling they have
achieved their purpose and may now return to the city for a well deserved
meal, but just as that thought crosses the lesser officers mind, his eyes
light up in surprise as a massive axe comes swooping down on the neck of his
companion, lopping it clean off.  Before he can even turn to run in fear a
second Ogre swings a massive tree trunk, hitting him square in the chest,
shattering his ribs and sending him flying for several yards into a small
patch of bushes.  As he lay there, life slipping form his grasp, he can hear
the Ogre camp yelling and fighting as they rip his companions corpse apart,
tearing his arms and legs off and slinging the stump of a corpse around in a
frenzy of hunger.  He whispers a silent prayer to Takhisis to save him from
this most gruesome of fates and opens his eyes.  Just in time to see a
massive hand reach down and engulf his entire head in its grasp, it grunts
"{DIt seems we shall eat after all{ ."  Then he closes his fist, crushing
the man's skull effortlessly and letting the brain matter ooze in between
his fingers.  Murklar shuffles back to the camp with the second corpse and
tosses it straight into the frenzy, where it is also ripped apart limb by
limb.  The Ogres settle down to grub when the Shaman stands and grunts,
"{dBrothers, we cannot continue to live this way, there is no food here and
one of us must go forth into the land and fight for the Dark Queen and find
us a new place to live.  A place where there is plenty of meat and bones to
chew and water for us to drink.  Who shall do this{ ?"  One of the Ogres
slowly stands form his place by the fire and grunts, "{RMurklar shall go, he
is the biggest and strongest of us and he will crush many humans heads and
drink in their blood{ ."  A little ways from the fire Murklar the alpha Ogre
stands and grasping the shaft of his bloody axe grunts, "{DYes,Murklar shall
go and I will make weapons from their bones{ !"  The sun sets over the
jagged peaks of Dargaard and the plains of Throt descend into darkness. 
Murklar strides off swiftly and brings the darkness with him.  Murklar
comes......

Sitting at a large desk made of vallenwood, the sorcerer sits, examining a map of Solamnic Lands and other various sketches. '{DI should slay you for not stating your name and your purpose for being here.{x'

Intimidation slowly creeping over the young man, he quickly answers. "{rI beg to differ my lord, but if you see fit to do so, I will not argue.{x" A wide grin spreads across the face of the dark elf. "{DVery well then, state your resons for intruding upon my work.{x"

Lowering his head in shame the apprentice says. "{rI did not mean to overstep my boundaries.{x" Snapping quickly in anger Theriss retorts. "{DYou seem to have lost your faith in the Queen's Vision, let me show you once again!{x"

Allowing the arcane words to quickly fall off his tongue, Theriss focuses his enegry, blasting a ball of emense flame upon the apprentice, sending the invidual flying into the hallway, leaving nothing but a charred corpse in its wake. "{DOur Queen has little use for those whom do not trust in her every whim.{x"

The blast of energy shakes the very foundation of the Tower, sending paintings and other treasures tumbling from the walls of the structure to the floor below. Theriss exits the study, carrying a spellbook. He utters but one sentence.

Arlanthis quickly swings the blade to remove the acid like blood, this hes learned from his past experiences.
He looks up as the creature dissolves to see fire and destruction all around him.
The streets are littered with the corpses of Solamnics and Dragonarmy soldiers alike.
The body of his company captain lay twisted and mangled by his side,wearing the face of anguish even in death.
Several of the structures burn as he looks down the Grand March and suddenly he realizes the entire
city of Solanthus is burning before his eyes.
Arlanthis screams and runs down the street, dodging corpses along the way.
He stops as he comes across a crying man outside a ransacked store clutching two small children in his arms.
He rushes to the man only to stop short realizing the children are dead.
"{rWhy have you forsaken us{?" the man yells with tears in his eyes.

he can hear men and beast yelling together in a twisted chorus.Firestorms rain down from the sky
and turn the night to day.He turns the corner to see Sinjin and the High Priestess backed up
against the southern building. Corpses and blood from all manner of creature surround Sinjin like a small wall.
Blood showers through the air as he hacks into foes.He turns to see Arlanthis enter the square and cackles
as his hacking is givin new vigor.The High Priestess goes to make for a smile but
before she can an arrow pierces through her head.Her eyes roll back and she slumps to the ground, lifeless.
Sinjin roars like a wild animal and throughs himself into his foes.
Dancing with his blade as only a master could.Suddenly a massive multi-headed dragon comes crashing down

shaking the very foundation of the earth.He says a silent prayer to Kiri-Jolith and raises his blade

"{WNo silly, far from it.You must have dosed off on your rest from the watch.Come, the mercenaries wish
to speak with us.Let us hear what they have to say{." Arlanthis nods and stands.
Giving one last boggled look at the stars he says a silent prayer and collects himself.

As the air outside grows hotter, the air inside a large, dwarven made
market stall standing at the very front of the entrance to the Freelancers
Market grows even hotter still.  Inside this stall, a dwarf by the name of
Delacom is seen leaning on the large smithy hammer he keeps by his side at
all times.  With a heavy sigh, expertly concealing his excitement, he
adresses the very large crowd of men that is gathering before him. 
"{RAlright men!  I have very simple instructions for you.  Do what I say and
there will be no trouble.  Complain, and I will send you away.  Its as
simple as that.  I am here to help you...  Mind that I do not have to if I
wish it.  {w" The dwarf pauses for a second and then continues, "{RSo for
starters...  Everyone gather in a single file line so it will be easier for
me to keep up with everything.  When you step forward, give me your name and
age and that is it on your part.  {w" Letting out another sigh, the dwarf
walks over a finely crafted desk that stands in the farthest most corner in
the back of the stall and opens the dottom drawer and pulls out some things.
Wondering what the smith is up to, the person at the head of the line asks,
"{CWhat are you getting?  {w" and cranes his neck to see.  Letting out a
slight chuckle Delacom turns around with a clipboard, parchment, pencil, and
a measuring apparatus in his hands and quickly walks to the exact spot he
was standing earlier.  Still curious, the same man asks "{CWhats all that
for?  {w".  Setting the stuff gently on the ground, Delacom finally replies,
"{RYou are a curious one arent you?  Are you sure your not part Kender? 
{w".  With a look of shock the man quickly closes his mouth and the smith
continues, "{RWell anyway, as you will soon find out, the stuff I have
gathered is for my use.  I can not remember all your names so I will right
them on this parchment here.  {w" he picks up the parchment and clipboard,
waves it around, and sets it back down.  "{RThis measuring apparatus I have
here is...  Well...  For your measurments to put it plainly{w".  "{GWhy do
you need our measurements for?  {w" a man somewhere int he middle of the
line asks.  "{RI need them because armor and weapons are best suited for the
individual.  People are different...  As is equipment.  They are crafted for
the indivdual and are best used by that indivdual.  {w" Delacom starts to
pace around the room as he explains further, "{RThink of it as an extension
to your body.  A sword that is fluid and deadly in your hands might feel
like a block of lead in anothers.  Armor that is close fitting and
comfortable to you for maximum performance and protection, might be too
loose or too tight to another.  {w" He pauses, stops for a second, and
resumes walking, "{RThis is why I need your measurements.  I want you to be
able to perform your best while you are on that battlefield and equipment
made FOR you will lead you there.  Equipment you can be proud to wear and
surive in...  Or be proud to die in, knowing you performed your best should
things turn for the worse.  {w" Delacom stops in his tracks at the spot he
left his things, bends over and picks them up off the ground, "{RNow... 
Lets begin shall we?  This will take some time so I am hoping all of you
will bear with me while this drags out.  Should you grow tired, or bored, or
restless and wish to leave, you may do so and return later should you wish
it.  {w" The smith grabs his pencil and points it to the man at the start of
the line, "{RName and age please...  {w" The man stands silent for a few
seconds then speaks up, "{CZakariah.  Zakariah Dallian.  Age,
twentythree{w".  After writing this down Delacom looks up and examins the
man carfully.  He is quite handsome with a very muscular build.  He has jet
black hair which is spiked at the top and piercing green eyes.  There is a
scar that runs from just a little above his left eyebrow, down to his left
cheek bone.  Grabbing the measuring apparatus, Delacom calls Zakariah
forward and begins to take his measurements which the smith then writes down
on the parchment beside Zakariahs name and age, tells him thank you for the
cooperation and informs him that he may leave, then beckons forth the next
person in line.

From the air her words continue.  "{cFor love is a two-way thing.  And perhaps...
just perhaps it may be here after all.{x"
 
"{yMy name is Cordani.{x"  I need to hear myself say it.  I need the assurance.
The years of trying to build a man of this hollow shell progresses slowly.
The taste of a strong brew lingers in my mouth - a treat, for I have sworn
off the weak stuff, the stuff that pollutes my mind.  This from the dwarf
that knows me best at the Last Call, is the only dark liquid I now consume.
 
"You're looking more like a knight everyday, Cordani.  But sooner or later
you're going to be throwing away years and all of this will be for nothing
if you do not seek redemption from the Gods." the ol' Barkeep says.
{yThe Gods - I've been fighting them for so long.{x I ponder, he knows me far
too well to let me keep thinking.  "Have you already forgotten why w-you're
doing this?"
 
"{yNo.  I must remember what it is to be a knight.  Everyday I feel like I'm
getting better, but also everyday I feel further away from whom I really am.{x"
I answer the dwarven barkeep, the only person that has given me the benefit
of the doubt.  "{yTo have the privilege to serve the Gods, I still...{x"
My words trail off into a whisper.  I hate the Gods.  I was born a tool to be
used in war by the Dark Queen.  How can I possibly forgive the Gods?  Moreso
how can I ever forgive myself for the thing I've let myself turn into?  All
of my efforts now seem futile to reverse all of the corruption in my heart.
 
"Remember Mishakal.  She helped your father, seek her advice."  The dwarf
knew my father, has told me stories about him.  Apparently this self-loathing
and druken attitude of mine comes directly from my bloodline.  I've heard
that he was a Death Knight, and I've tried to seek him out, but I've never
heard what the truth of his fate was - had he been redeemed?  Will I?
 
"{yThank you.  I feel so helpless sometimes, like I've failed and that I'm
going to be too old to change this life soon.{x" I admit.  He places a hand
on my shoulder.  He knows.  
 
"As long as you still have breath, you haven't failed."
 
"{yIts the moment I give up.{x" I conclude.  We have had this discussion
before.  My task I already know, I need to find Mishakal, I need to fall
before the Gods and I need to beg for redemption.  If my father was able to
find peace, than maybe I am as well.  I heard he had sold his soul because
of his own shortcomings and dealings with Takhisis, Chemosh and most
regrettably, Hiddukel.  But I also heard that his peace was restored after
much trial and tribulation.
 
"{yAs long as I have the chance of winning her heart, I will fight.{x"
 
I gather myself and my belongings and take a moment to gaze upon my home at
the Last Call before I send the barkeep an acknowledging nod and step out.
A breeze touches my face and refreshes me.  I close my eyes for a moment, it
feels as if the wind wants me to travel North.  I nod as if needing to let
some unforseen God know that I am not fighting this anymore.  I head North.
 
The path is all too familiar.  The packed down trail, dirt now from the
travellers and caravans using it constantly.  The shrubbery and weeds lining
the sides as if nature gave us this trail and wanted us not to stray and
trample the rest of the land around it.  The smell of spices and weary travellers
remind me of Otik and his amazing potatoes.  I have walked this route so many times
and yet I have never stopped to consider how much the way I perceive this route
defines me.
 
The night starts to blanket the skies and there are fewer and fewer travellers.
A group of Caergoth militia stride by, battleworn from goblins.  I hear quite
the commotion in the distance.  Just up ahead are lush fields and white daisies.
However I am tired and am far too exhausted for a run in with goblins or thieves. I 
camp the night and say a prayer before I retire.  If I am to seek redemption from the
Gods, I might as well start believing in them now.  {yMishakal, you already know.{x
 
The next morning I pack up and make my way.  The course of the next few weeks will
prove me, and I know once I hit the Thelgaard Hills there'll be no turning back and
running to the Last Call for another week, month or year of saying I'm going to do
this and never actually get it down.  This uneventful life of mine will undoubtedly
soon be littered with strangers, villians and Gods.  But I want it that way, this
is my journey to redemption.

The road arrows to such an extent at this part, that only one wagon is able to
go by at at time.  Very lucky for me there aren't that many at the time when
I decide to travel.  I sleep most of the days and travel by night, in order to
travel in the cool and dew of the nights.  The strange sounds and other night
owls keep me perked and ready for anything.  The Thelgaard Hill's strike quite
a familiar note with me.
 
"{yMishakal, not Paladine,{x" I think alound.  I am not heading to Palanthas,
there is no good reason for me to go there.  It is in Solanthus where the
temple of Mishakal lies.  The Goddess of Healing and Forgiveness, I would hope.
 
As the days go by and I travel the road between Caregoth and Thelgaard, the
amount of travellers increases.  There are campfires and caravans, people set
temporary shops at the side of the road and sell their wears, vegetables and
potions.  I had an interesting chat with Ariola, a lovely young lady.
 
The most painstaking moment of this trip however, was finally making it just
north of the walls of Thelgaard.  The Randar Estate.
I barely know why, the memories not even of my own, but this estate reminds
me so much of a past that I could never wish to my greatest enemy.  Something
about the banners, the fine oak columns and beautifully maintained estate
tug at my heartstrings.  How can I remember a place that I have physically
never been before?  What kind of emotional connection did my bloodline
establish?  My eyes tear up as I gaze at the estate from a distance, not caring
to attract any attention from the guardsmen.  This isn't my goal anyhow.
 
After resting and contemplating my connection with my father, I gather myself
and prepare for the rest of the trip.  Back in the Thelgaard hills I start on
my way but am caught off-guard as a mountain goat traverses by, sending a
rock my way and almost catching me in the head.  I am hungry.
To spare the details, I ate half a goat.
 
Finally I make it the deep and dark Thelgaard Forest.  The silence is eery and
offsetting.  I dart my eyes for any sign of life and only catch a glimpse of
a rabbit or rodent here and there.  No birds, no real life...is this what it
feels like in my head?  Abandoned, fear?  I keep walking, Solanthus is due East.
 
"{cMay I help you?{x" A hired guardsman asks me, as I wearily make it to the
Western entrance of Solanthus.  The days beating down on me and my rations
running quite low.  It is a fact that I may look like a straggler just passing
through.  But I am not, and I am not leaving until I have spoken with Her.
 
"{yThe Temple of Mishakal,{x" I state.  I have a map, I can find it.  A look of
understanding comes across the guardsmen's face.  He gestures in the temple's
direction.  I nod in acknowledgement and start to trudge that way.  I am here.
I have made it to Solanthus and soon I will be before the alter of Mishakal.
Is forgiveness this close?  Will she greet me with understanding or will she
face me with wrath?  I will take whatever she offers, for my life is indescript
without her healing.

"{rYou don't know us and you don't even know yourself.
If you knew yourself and you knew us, you would win every battle.
If you only knew only yourself and nothing of us, for every battle won so will you lose.
But you know neither yourself nor us...so a hundred and them all shall you lose.{x"
 
How these words pain my memory as I remember the Lord
I had put to rest.  The darkness covering the city of
Lemish pained me to greatly to do much less than to
dedicate myself to freeing the pain within.  I easily
recall the poor souls look at me hopelessly, as if
expecting me to be able to do something more than try.
 
"{cWhy only now does someone come, when we needed you
knights before they took our child!{x"
 
Humanity.  I felt like them.  For the first time since
I have been born I started to feel human.  To feel the
pain and responsibility - I could not stand it!  How
has it been so blatant all these years and yet I lived
without so much as acknowledging that other people
existed that felt as much and as passionately as I do.
 
My entire life was built around being something I 
never truly was.  Finally, after all these years of
wallowing in the darkness and despair that the Dark
Queen had imposed on me, was I beginning to start to
see the humanity that was around me.
 
I have seen dragons; I have seen goblins; I have seen
dwarves and elves.  I have seen so many beasts and
fowl that I thought I knew enough to be a warrior. But
the Lord was right...I knew nothing.  All I did was
see what was in front of me and never consider it.  I
did not know this world and I most definitely did not
know myself.
 
{RPain shoots{x through my left arm and I struggled to
keep my eyes open.  I am so tired, as it has been at
least weeks since I've last rested.  I recall the
events that has led me to this.
 
After finally making it to the Temple of Mishakal it
had been days on my knees in prayer.  Forgiveness and
mercy before the Goddess is what my heart yearned for.
The answer however, was not at all what I expected.
 
"{cI'm not staying if all you're going to do is sit
here and seek pity for yourself,{x" a follower of the
Godness had said to me, if not in so many words.  It
is then I realised that Mishakal was there as she had
revealed herself to me, but it was up to I to prove my
worth of redemption to her.
 
From there I sought out to cleanse my own soul of the
wickedness within.  The hobgoblins just East of
Solanthus were first.  I would slay the dark souls and
offer them to Mishakal as a gesture of my geniuity.
 
Soon after that I needed rest and would find myself in
Lemish.  Lemish...this is where the next chapter of my
life starts.  For here is where I vowed never to sleep
until the city was cleansed of the Darkness imposed on
to it.  It is here where I fought to Lord that held it
captive.  It is here where the Ice Dragon summoned by
the Dark Queen tore me a new perspective on war.  And 
it was here that I heard the voice of Mishakal offer me
just enough guidance to keep holding on.
 
I shall elaborate more...but I really need some rest.
My eyebrows heavy with sweat and my breathing perplexed
I take the last sip of water from a flask I could've
sworn I just refilled.
 
The city is not cleansed.  I am beaten.  There is more
to this story than these thoughts.  My eyes open, light
pierces through.  I need to stay awake... you need to
know more...

"It is the day of Soldai and the siege of Solanthus continues."  The ink
dries into the parchment as the young historian stares at the words he has
written.  The noise of a crowd breaks his concentration.  Irritated, he
quietly stands and moves to the window overlooking the town hall courtyard. 
Outside inhabitants of he city packs themselves in shoulder to shoulder.  In
front of the crowd on a small wooden stage are two podiums.  Behind those
are two humans, politicians, in heated debate.  The one speaking is a tall,
older man.  His name is Brodderick Steelworthy and he is highly respected in
the city.  His father was a legendary knight that had fought in the War and
was loved by the people.  Being his only son, Brodderick was expected to
follow his footsteps, but a chilhood accident took his left arm from him. 
So he became a member of the Solanthus city council to uphold justice.  "The
Dark Queen's armies must be stopped!"  He cried out to the mob, "We must
continue to protect these walls and wait for the help of our neighbors." 
Scattered cheers come from the crowd.  "Critical supply lines have been
severed!  The city is starving and yet we see no help from the outside
world!"  Cries out the opponent begin the other podium.  He is short and
bald and goes by the name Corilius Myers.  In the last week he has become
known through the city as the voice of reason.  His past is largely unknown
but it is said he is an accountant.  Rumors of him being involved with thief
and mercenary guilds have spread but still his support grows in these dark
times.  "The Knights of Takhisis have offered us safety!  They have wagons
filled with food and medicine waiting to be brought in.  All we have to do
is raise the Queen's flag atop the capital!"  The crowd erupts in commotion
atthe word of food.  Cheers spring out in the air.  "Do not listen to these
lies people!  These monsters that offer these things are the same that
murdered countless innocents just like us during the War!"  Brodderick
interjects hushing the inhabitants, "The armies from Palanthas and others
are going to come break this siege, we must wait!"  Many people nod to these
words and raise their arms in support.  "It has been weeks!  Where is our
help people?!?"  Corilius cries out looking wildly around him, "We must help
ourselves!"  At that the mob erupts in cheers and a fight breaks out near
the front of the stage.  The two politicians are quickly swept off the stage
by their security forces.  As night fell over the city Brodderick sat in his
chambers thinking about the situation.  A small commotion in the hallway
interrupted his thoughts and he looked toward the door.  "Ferrus?"  He
called calmly, figuring it was his personal guard.  The door opened and a
man's body filled the doorway.  Brodderick sighed at the sight of his guard.
"Come in friend," he said, "I wish to talk..  " His voice trailed trailed
off as the body moved from the doorway into the candlelit room.  Protruding
from his chest was a spear and his limbs hung limp, face expressionless,
eyes empty.  Behind him a massive Minotaur enters the room.  Dropping the
spear causing the corpse to crumple to the floor he approaches the
politician.  "You can kill me but that will not change..."  Brodderick
Steelworthy's head slid from his shoulders and rolled to the floor.

I recall Lemish as clear as day as I hike up the
mountainside.  My boots feel heavy as sweat pours down my
body and ultimately burden down my feet.  My eyes are
focused on the thick bush ahead as I use my sword to
clear a path ahead.
 
{cMmmph...{x  I hear in the distance.
 
My eyes dart to the source of the groan as the trail
widens.  A seperate path I had not noticed before seems
to have been the toll for another warrior.  His armor
stained with blood, his breastplate looks as if it is the
only thing holding him together.  Something tore into him
and I know exactly what.
 
"{yIt is here..{x" I say as I hurry to his side and look
over his wounds.  Unless the power of the Gods were to
coarse through my veins, there is nothing I can do!  This
mans wounds are far beyond the pain threshold of any
creature I know.
 
I peer to the wagon knocked over and the blood smeared on
the room and inside.  My heart dreads who else was with
this man...what were they even doing here!  I utter a 
prayer to Mishakal and let myself fall into the foilage
around me.  I know what I am doing here.
 
Shees...shees...shees...
 
In an instant I am sharpening my blade and exchanging
polite words with the dying warrior.  I am not actually
dialoguing with him as much as I am monologuing to a few
groans and mummurs.  He would probably prefer to die in
peace!  But I cannot leave him, and my blades are not
sharp yet.
 
Time seems to sleep and the sun starts to tuck itself 
away, bringing a deadly chill to my spine as I continue
to sharpen my weapons as sweat still pours down my 
forehead.
 
"{cKill it for me...{x" were the last words from the dying
man as his eyes finally shut and he were now at peace.
 
I stand up and close my eyes, take in a deep breath.  My
quest has been simple, I understand it now.  Mishakal
sent me to find Her Hand, but I believe she wanted to
test me to see if I were able to find myself.  The evil
dragon from the Dark Queen whom has enslaved my very soul
in the past would no longer be able to mock me.
 
As night befalls me another deathly chill forces my arms
to wrap around me.  It seems as if in one instant the
land is normal and than the next, I conquer a ledge and
am knee-deep in white powdery snow.  The cold in itself
is almost enough to kill me!
 
Finally I make it to the lair of the ice dragon - not
without incident of course.  My determination intact if
my common-sense isn't.  My heart and mind were still
battered from the last time the dragon tore me up and
left me with just enough life to force me to consider
just exactly the amount of power I lack going against
Her Majesty.
 
Dragonfear...as soon as I faced the majestic Ice-Dragon
I could feel it tingling in my veins.  How could one
not admire such beasts with every drop of blood within
them..why shouldn't they be feared?
 
"{yI have come t-to give you a m-message to take b-b-back
to your Q-Queen,{x" I state as I fight the shivering cold
off.  "{yI may not h-have the weapons I need to wage a war
against y-you...but I am still a warrior.{x"
 
The Ice dragon is less than impressed, peering into my
very soul as if summing up how pathetic my life really
is.
 
"{yAnd I will NOT be found running away or searching for
some blessing when I can be proving myself and earning
it!{x" I bellow as I draw the red 'Fury of His Makers Hand'
lance that was gifted to me so long ago.
 
The Ice dragon swoops its head down with astonishing
speed - especially in consideration of its size.  I
strike at it...or so I believe!  Before I can even blink
I feel pain shooting through me as blood is all over the
snow and the freezing chill in the air is the only thing
keeping my heart from burning up right now.
 
I cough out blood and find myself in an even worse
situation than the lest time I encountered the dragon.
It didn't even need to try...no magick, nothing, it just
came down and swept me from my feet with a single motion.
 
{c"{WYou're not a God.{c"{x the Ice dragon bellows, lowering
itself to peer deep within my eyes, my soul.
 
This is the moment!  With my left arm I snatch the lance
that had been disarmed from me and with the last bit of
energy in me I thrust it with all of my might and speed
toward the heart of the Ice dragon.
 
There is a glint in the dragon's eye.  As if he could 
kill me with less than a word.  As if even if I were to
be succesful it would all be his intent.  As if...blood.
The lance sticks and blood gushes out.  The dragon does
not make a sound as it falls dead.
 
Back in Solanthus and before the bowl in the temple of
Mishakal I cannot help but let my mind wander.  Did the
Ice dragon just act to appease me...to let me feel as
if I had accomplished something?  But why?  What did it
see in my soul that not even I can feel?  I shiver at
the thought that no matter how powerful I think I am, the
Ice dragon could've shredded me without any effort.
 
I take in a deep breath and let my head hang for a
moment.  I hear there are bats lurking around the Garnet
mountains...everyday, there will be no rest until I have
proven myself before Mishakal...until I have found the
Hand of Mishakal and am able to rid Lemish of the
accursed Knights of Takhisis.
 
I take in another deep breath.  Through all of this
there has been and is only one woman on my mind and my
heart, making this struggle less dreary, knowing that I
must redeem myself no matter the cost.  For her love.
 
I am Cordani and if anything, a legacy.

I take in a deep breath and let my head hang for a moment.
Blood drips from the tip of my blade - it is not my own.
My armour is stained with drips splashing up from the small
puddle of blood at my feet.  There is an awful stench that
is stemming from the pile of bat carcasses before me.  My
arms are sore and my eyes are heavy so I do not care about
the blood.  I just stand there with long drawn breaths as
I try to rest my tired muscles from the last altercation.
 
"{yHow many more?{x" I ask myself warily.  My eyes drop to the
gashes in my arms and the loose chainmail hanging from my
abdomen.  I don't know if I'm doing this more to rid the
surface of Krynn from the evil inhibiting it or if I'm
subconsciously seeking out punishment for all of my own
wrongdoings.
 
"{yMishakal...{x" I find myself whispering in a gentle prayer.
It is then I realise there is someone whom I owe a dear
apology.
 
I chug back the last bit of water in my decanter and take
in another deep breath - it is time for me to journey back
to the city of Palanthas.  I plot the journey out in my
mind and make mental notes of where I will be able to find
water and producing foliage.
 
After the long journey through the mountains and plains,
battling skeletal beings and hobgoblins while sometimes
going days without a sip of water, I finally make it to my
destination - Palanthas.  The temple of Paladine, to be
more precise.  It is there by the fountain where I settle
and loosen my armament that in the moment I close my eyes
and reopen them, the bustle of the city has died down and
the beauty of the night cloaks the streets.  I must have
dozed off for a few moments there, atleast!
 
"{cIt had to be Mishakal - none of the others are quite as
forgiven,{x" Crysania says in a very soft and almost 
soothing tone from behind me.  My ears perk and I shift to
now face her better.  A calmness runs over me.
 
"{yI came to apologise,{x" I respond.
 
"{cI never told you that you needed to apologise, I only said
that whenever you're ready to talk that I'll be here.{x"
 
"{yI want to be a Knight, is all.  It's all I ever wanted.{x"
 
"{cI know,{x" Crysania extends a hand and places it gently on
my shoulder.  Her gaze extends past my own, a trait of the
blindness she suffers from.  "{cI always knew.{x"
 
"{yBut now in the grace of Mishakal my heart yearns even
more to try and restore the goodness and unity of man and
beast - to tear the barriers the Gods have put infront of
us and to restore...{x" in the brief pause as I catch my 
breath, Crysania intervenes.
 
"{c..Love, Cordani.  You have a heart of care and compassion
and that is the only reason Mishakal restored your grace.
It is love that you feel, Cordani, which is why you cannot
understand it and why it feels so powerful,{x" Crysania
explains as her tiger lowers its head, as if hearing and
taking her gentle words to heart.  "{cMishakal has never
wanted you to wage a war against all of the evil on Krynn
without first ensuring that you've won the war within 
yourself, Cordani.  The moment you no longer are confused
or distraught by the love that you feel, but are able to
channel it productively and effectively in Her name and
purpose.{x"
 
"{yYou always knew?{x"  It feels good to know that there is
someone out there whom believes in my heart, if even ever
it has radiated with an ice-cold hum.
 
"{cWhen you met me last time, would you believe these words
or would my tears resonate a hundred fold more?{x"
 
There is a moment of silence as I recall the incident with
the Ice Dragon that let me kill it.  It is as if everyone
around me already have the answers and are just watching
as I mould myself into a knight - and how few there are 
left of us.
 
"{yI would have fought you even more - how wise you are.{x"
 
"{cAnd it all comes from my God,{x" Crysania smiles - it is 
most definitely the warmest smile I've seen in a long time.
It is not snide nor sarcastic, but gentle.  The expression
tells me that she has even more to say, but that I am not
yet ready.  "{cGo find your redemption, Cordani, go create
your legacy.{x"
 
"{yThank you,{x" I acknowledge and let my eyes drift to the
stars as if that is where she were directing me.
 
"{cAnd...{x" Crysania moves her hand from my shoulder to stroke
the beautifully crafted cloak that I adorn.  "{c..tell her
that you cannot help making mistakes.{x"
 
I close my eyes a moment.  The things she must have seen
when she still had sight must have been more than a
lifetimes worth.  I set my eyes on the temple of her God
before me - Paladine.  I owe him an apology and I owe her
the proper respect.  She knows exactly what my intent is 
and accompanies me to the altar to pray.  I fall to my 
knees and take in a deep breath, knowing that beneath
all of the heroics, honour and strength of a knight is
the heart and belief that drives us.

I sit in the chapel inside the Holy Order halls, palms sweaty and feverish.
I hold my head in my hands and pray, pray to the gods of light that they may give me the strength to battle
the fever in my sleep.Have I been cursed by some foul necromancer?Is this a curse from the gods?
Have I not done my duty?Have I not safe guarded the path to Dargaard for long enough?Why do the gods toss me about
so in their little game!?These are but a few of the thoughts that race through my mind as I pray.
Lightning flashes out side and rain beats down on the city of Solanthus.
The weather seems to have turned for the worst with my mood.
Theres movement by the door and I instinctively draw my sword and spin, ready to lop the head off of the
stinking zombie dragging into the room.
I charge across the room sword drawn screaming at the top of my lungs only to stop short as my feverish
eyes suddenly focus in on the face of a terrified cleric.
Theres a tense moment as we stand there in the dimly, candle lit chapel, my sword point on the throat of the cleric, hand sweaty
and shaking.The man, looks as if he could scream for all his worth but not a sound comes out.
"Forgive me Adontes, I have been troubled of late and ill.You startled me." I then put my sword away as smoothly as I could
and helped the man up.The man composes himself and tries to act as if he wasnt inches from soiling himself,
"It is quite alright Arlanthis." he shuffles slightly, "Being a Templar is at times a heavy load to carry my friend,
you must always have faith and know that what you do is for right.You are a warrior for the light, leave
your troubles at the door my son, find comfort in the embrace of Mishakal." he then reached his hand out
and placed it on my head, uttering a few soothing words and my fever slide back into the depths some.
Thank you brother, if you would please leave me be.I have much to discuss with my god.
The man but nodded slowly and just turned and walked out, closing the large wooden doors behind him.
I just stood for a moment in shock at what my eyes saw but my heart felt.......am I falling apart?
Slowly I gained my resolve and steeled myself...what is wrong with me?
I dropped to my knees at the pew I was just at and just lowered my head back into my hands.
Returning to my thoughts.The dark army hasnt moved....what are they planning?Where is there leaders?Where are the Solamnics?
Kiri-jolith take me my head hurts! Should I stay and defend the city? Do they need my help?
Or should I return to my duty? Return to the mountain.
Just thinking of it made me sick to my stomach.The rotting corpses, the tarnished dreams.
All the men ive known who have died there....it just makes anger well in me.
I shook for a moment and looked up at the ceiling with my fist shaking.
Is this what I must do to stop the fever that consumes me?! Answer me!!!!
The mountain of Dargaard must burn!!
I tire of seeing the same sickening faces looking at me there, the same long dead ones whom defend the mountain.
They are a disease, a curse.They must be set free.I must gather my fellow Templar and burn the mountain!
It must be burned!
What foul ghoul have I not stood against?What misguided fool have I not banished to the abyss!
None at the mountain can stand to Sinjin and I with the right character of men at our side!We are Templar!
Kiri-Jolith guide our blades for the mountain must burn!
Only then can I have peace from the demons in my thoughts.

Ranavin sits in a dark, dank dungeon somewhere in the Solamnic plains. 
He nurses a large knot on his head obtained during his capture to the sound
of dripping water and a swinging chain.  He knows not where he is but he
does know he has fallen into the hands of a group of Templar waiting for him
as he went to the Dark mountain to proclaim himself to Chemosh, the lord of
death.  As a young man he idolized the evil power of life after death and
devoted himself to the cause of evil.  He knew he would be a powerful
necromancer one day and after seeing the Lich Lord Mikhal in all his evil
glory he knew that he must go to the mountain of doom and train under this
most infamous of necromancers.  "Blast!"  Says Ranavin to himself,"How could
those Templar have known what I was going to do?"  He stands and tries to
feel his way around the dark cell hes been placed in."  Can they tell my
intentions from just a look?  How will Mikhal accept me for a student if I
fail to even reach it to the mountain?  Surely they dont know my intentions"
Suddenly a shaft of light breaks through the darkness, interrupting his
conversation with himself.  The cell door creeks open the form of three men
can barely be made out as Ranavin's eyes adjust to the light.  He puts a
hand over his eyes to get a better look and a voice calls out, "You have
been charged with practicing death magic and having ties to the Undead.  The
skeletol servant accompanying you has been purged and you will be soon to
follow if you dont answer our questions and confess to your dark sins." 
Ranavin's stomach drops to his feet, they found his servant he spent a week
straight trying to gather enough energy to summon.  He has been revealed for
a necromancer to them already and has not a leg to stand on.  Deep in his
heart he knows he will never leave this place."  I am but a simple man I
swear, I merely dabbled.  I barely have learned to resurrect that one
servant."  Where were you going?"  The man in the doorway asks."  Nowhere, i
was just trying to see a zombie so I might try and learn how to make one
myself."  "Who is your master?"  None, I have none.  Im a beginner I
promise."  What do you know of the ones whom reside at this mountain?" 
"Nothing I swear, I know nothing of this place.  The men enter the room
bringing the light with them.  One looks to be a simple guard but the other
two where all white robes with the symbol of infinity on it.  The man who
had been speaking looks to be in his middle ages, brown hair, stern look on
his face and carrying a bucket of water.  He looks to average looking man
and says "You may wait outside."  "Yes brother."  The man bows and walks
out.  Closing the door behind him just far enough to let a sliver of light
shine through onto Ranavin like a spot light.

The man looks down at Ranavin sitting on his cell bench and says, "You
are a liar, you will tell us everything you know you evil bastard and we may
purge you of your sins quickly."  "I dont know anything i swear, im just a
simple beginner.  You have to believe me, ive never hurt anyone."  As the
last word leaves Ranavin's mouth the man throws the pale of icy water right
into his face.  Ranavin gasps as he trys to catch his breath but right
before he can the second man whom hasnt said a single word so far reach's
over a grasps his arm.  The world explodes and lightning shoots through
Ranavin's body.  Blood vessels burst on his arm and he loses his bowels. 
The man lets go and Ranavin takes in a deep breath, then screams like hes
never screamed before."  Now tell us what you know sinner..  Who is your
master?"  "I swear please please, I dont know anything about the ones whom
reside here.  I came hoping they would accept me.  The skeleton with me is
the one man ive ever killed.  I swear ill never do it again..  Please
please."  Ranavin's plead is cut short as the other man grabs his arm again
and boils his blood with electricity.  Suddenly the door bursts open and
both men stop and gasp as they turn and salute the man whom now stands in
the doorway.  Ranavin chokes on his own blood and smoke curls from his hair.
He wipes the blood running from his nose with his sleeve and looks at the
man in the doorway.  Standing in a confident poster and holding a sword in
one hand is a charming looking man with blonde hair in shining golden
armor."  Is this the necromancer youve captured?"  Says the blonde haired
man to the inquisitors."  Yes Arlanthis sir, we have put him to the question
but he refuses to cooperate.  Evil has consumed his soul and he hides the
location of the Undead."  Arlanthis just nods with a serious look on his
face and walks to Ranavin swiftly.  "Please sir, I know nothing.  Spare me."
Arlanthis just looks stone faced at Ranavin and slides his sword tip into
the soft spot in between his collar bone.  Ranavin lets out what little of a
scream his voice has left and Arlanthis twists up on the blade, lifting
Ranavin slightly by the bone."  I will give you one chance to redeem your
soul and tell me what members of the Undead are left and which one of them
you serve."  Ranavin can only barely squeeze out the name "Mikhal" through
the pain.  Arlanthis frowns at the name and pulls the sword out in one quick
motion,spins, and cuts Ranavin's head right off his shoulders.  The body
slumps to the ground headless."  Burn his body with the rest of what we
collect in these days to come.  "We will add his name in the prayer
tonight."  "Yes sir."  The inquisitor says.  "And ready the men, let it be
known we will ride on the mountain in the name of justice and burn each and
every one of the minions of death.  There shall be no mercy for them.  We
shall release all their souls from the prison they have placed it.  May the
light have mercy on them my brethren."  With that Arlanthis turns, leaving
the headless body of Ranavin on the floor, blood pooling around it.

Subject A Storm Rages Over Dargaard~
Text
Thunder roars over the mountains of Dargaard, rain pouring from the cloud. As
the rainwater washes down the mountainside, it mixes with the blood of the
fallen and the devoted of the land, soaking into the tainted soil. Lightning
cracks and thunder roars, echoing through the caves of Dargaard, and a flash of
light illuminates to horrific face of what can barely be described. Dry, split
lips spread into an evil grin as the mage utters a short word, and begins his
ascent from the caves. At the entrance, he stops before the rain can touch his
rotting flesh, and he barks a short spellword, and a violent shift in gravity
throws the rain from the entrance of the caves, falling in all places but his
direct viscinity.
 
As the mage floats slowly from the cave, red eyes stare upon him from the dying
trees, shrubs, and from within ditches and caves all around. His voice course,
he speaks loudly, '{DCome forth, those of Aeleth!{X'. There is a short pause, and
as lightning splits the sky once more, a quick view can be seen of hundreds of
zombies, wraiths, undead, fallen, spectres, ghosts, everything told in tales to
frighten children. They form a mob-like crowd around the mage, obediently
waiting for his word. He pauses, overlooking all of them, and grins once more.
He parts his lips slowly and begins to speak loudly, '{DThey call you slaves...
lackies... puppets... But you are much more than that to Aeleth... You are much
more than that to me...{X' The crowd remains silent.
 
'{DThey preach their petty lies, assuming that one with an army so massive cannot
possibly properly train them all!{X' He looks out over the crowd, seeing some
creatures with missing limbs, '{DAnd they would be right... But what we lack in
training, we make up for with devotion! You've survived the transformation into
what you are now... NOT EVEN DEATH CAN TAKE YOU! YOU HAVE -BECOME- DEATH!{X' He
begins to scream, bile dripping from his lips. He then calms down a bit...
 
'{DIt is... beautiful...{X' He smiles, a short cackle escaping him. '{DThey have no
idea what they've gotten themselves into. The faithful devout shall NEVER fall!
We shall NEVER cease, and we shall watch the world pass them by through eyes
that never change...{X' The crowd begins to grow loud, moans and chants growing
to an extreme volume, and the mage smiles. There is another crack of lightning,
and the mage's face can be seen clearly for a moment. Floating above the crowd
before him is none other than Nayato Grendul, and peering out from the cave 
behind him, another smiling face, that of Mikhal Emenius.

As night falls on the Day of Shinarai, 19th of the Month of Ranmont, 
Zendfrel a young half-elf gravedigger finds herself in the Guild of Necromancy. 
A dark, fetid smelling place, the guilds only source of illumination is a crimson 
orb dangling in mid air above the center of the room.  More like dungeon then 
a place of learning the slick, moldy stone work walks of the building are lined 
with pegs and chains many holding various corpses of different shapes and 
sizes
 
   Dangling before Zendfrel is the corpse of a young Kagonesti maiden, 
body cleaned and well kept, besides the large metal hook piercing the back of 
her shoulder to hang her from the wall by the collar bone she has no visible 
wounds or signs of how she got to be where she is.  After taking several 
moments Zendfrel lifts her hand and blows a fine red powder, over the corpse 
but it stops before it touches it, flowing through magical enchantment through 
the air. As the red powder glides over the corpse in dusty, smoke like tendrils it
soon forms a pattern of lines showing the vein network of the creature behind it.
 
   Nodding to herself, Zendfrel waves a hand, and the dust vanishes as if it 
had never been there in the first place. Bringing her hand back across, she pats
the corpse on the cheek and turns around.  Looking up as if she could see the
night sky through the high dungeons roof she senses the very darkness of night
as it envelopes the world outside. Stepping forward into a void of nothingness 
she reappears almost instantly outside the Palanthas Graveyard...
 
   ...Walking right into a crusty, bug eyed old man covered in dirt and 
grime, reeking already of alcohol and his own musk.  Surprisingly, to anyone
who would take note, the beautiful young half elf falls into a hug with the old
man, whispering to him, {c"Drinking on the job again, eh Leth? For shame!"{x
Hugging her back he simple smiles dumbly and responds, {w"Damn righ', f'in 
city don' pay me 'nough ta' be sober an' dig!"{x before bursting into laughter. 
At that the sound of a rusty gate can be heard closing behind the pair as they
laugh together, two other voices arguing as the walk up, {w"I'm tellin you I'm 
going to Solanthus, if'n the cities paying  jus' 25 steel a head I'll be a rich man
off tha' war by the years end!!" {xto{w "And just as likely to pay 10 steel for
who'er burys your head ass"{x Greeting her other friends from the cities grave 
digging crew she walks arm in arm with the old coot Leth, singing drinking 
songs already as they walk up to Myrtal's Roost.
 
The night caries on, the four drinking and talking about who they buried
last week, the war, and every conspiracy Leth can think up from Takhisis taking 
Paladine as a lover to her own Conclave being in bed with the Thieves guild for 
various reasons. Zendfrel laughs and drinks with them all, appearing to any 
who care to watch even as the most jovial and kind of the three, paying for 
most of the drinks and them obliging with barely a word as if it were a normal 
thing. By midnight, all but one of them is within a blissful, alcohol induced, 
sleep. Laying with her head on the table as if sleep, Zendfrel opens one eye to 
check her companions. Finally, assured of their commitment to sleeping it off 
Zendfrel utters a word and fades out of existence leaving the reckoning of 
anyone as simply vanished, though it is common for her and few there who are 
awake or sober enough to notice even bat an eyelash at it.

Reappearing a few moments later, Zendfrel slides out the abyssal void 
and back into the material plane just inside the gates of the Palanthas 
graveyard.  Waving her hand behind herself to the gate, rickety, rusty, and 
generally not holding a catch, slams shut and locks itself with magical glowing 
chains. Uttering a few words, all along the fence a thick darkness materializes
impeding the view of any who walk by. Finally, as an added measure, she pulls 
out a scroll and recites the words, the moons above disappearing as the cities 
night sky is swept away by the onset of jet black clouds. 
 
   All these measures taken, a strange thing unfolds in the cities often
forgotten graveyard that night, strange, but of the last few months common. 
Zendfrel, to most who know her a polite, almost jovial young girl, unsure of her 
use of black magic and  often conflicted between her gift and her morals, takes 
on  a completely different demeanor. Her face looses all joy and happiness , 
even sadness and anger slide away leaving only a resolute scowl. {c"Come, we 
have little time, and I wish to reach the first one tonight."{x She says with a 
dreadful voice, callous and devoid of emotion, but she is answered by three 
skeletons who practically explode from the ground at her request. Walking 
forward to a large hole by what is left of a collapsed mausoleum she pulls an 
enchanted shovel from the sling on her back and taps it on the earth, the 
ground churning and shifting to move aside.  The skeletons rush forward and 
pick up picks and other mining gear at the gaping maw of the uncovered hole. 
At the bottom of the whole stone work has been cracked open to reveal an 
underground tomb leading up to the collapsed mausoleum. The skeletons jump 
down and begin their work.
 
   Two A.M., Zendfrel stands at the entrance of the whole in a trance like 
state. Rain has begun to fall in torrents to drench her clothes, winds whipping 
lose dirt from the hole at her already squinty eyes but she barely seems to 
notice. Mind fixed on her past, on the first time she ever dug a grave, she does 
not notice when the skeletons run back out of the hole to greet their mistress 
eagerly. Repeating their words several times in entirety before she notices, the 
skeletons go on with a conversational resolve unmatched in the undead, 
"{yMistress the whole antechamber was not collapsed we are through, a 
Zombie guards the  tomb though.{x" Finally, after hearing this sentence over a 
dozen times Zendfrel's thoughts snap back, the cries of her dying parents 
ringing in her ears as she looks into the absence of the skeletons eyes. {c"Right 
go in and lure it from the entrance to further in the tomb, I am coming."{x 
 
   Her minions scuttling off, Zendfrel, looks down at the hole coldly for a 
few moments, building her resolve and banishing the demons of her past she 
finally starts down. As she enters she watches the skeletons tease the zombie 
as they surround it near the sarcophagi, poking at it with their impromptu 
weapons of picks and shovels. A powerful undead, glowing a sickly green with 
pure necromantic energy, it swats at one of the skeletons, crumbling it to dust 
and broken bones. Undaunted by the display, Zendfrel assumes a meditative 
stance and utters a single powerful word and the zombie, though powerful, 
unattached to a master is compelled to obey and simply falls over inanimate.  A 
polite, but wicked smile on her face, Zendfrel closes her eyes and submits 
herself in her magic, casting every detection spell she knows, using scrolls for 
others she doesn't, she stands there simply embracing the dark magic flowing 
through her.

Opening her eyes as the hour turns to three am, Zendfrel is greeted to a 
treasure trove of visual delights, almost everything glowing with magical auras 
of one hue or another or even invisible to the naked eye, the room is full of 
powerful arcane artifacts and spell books. Taking a few moments to bask in the 
fruits of her diligent work, she spins around, taking in the circular tomb.  The 
walls, lined with book shelves and tables, hold artifacts of every kind. Wands, 
spell books, staves, potions, scrolls, staffs, even swords and other weapons, all 
glowing with magic and polished as if the Zombies eternity was the 
maintenance of his master's treasures.  The center of the room holds only a 
black and white marbled sarcophagus, etched with the story of its occupant 
and several runes of warding.
 
    Slowly but surely, her glee at the find is washed away by the cold waves 
of hatred in her heart. She walks forward, her glare growing colder and callous 
as she goes, she stops before the sarcophagi and commands her skeleton to 
open it. As soon as the lid begins its forced slide to the side, the skeleton is 
jolted against a bookshelf along the far wall by a cobalt blue lightning bolt and 
once again from the shelf as it makes contact with that.  Smiling politely, but 
coldly, down at the sarcophagus she pulls out several scrolls and components 
and begins reciting words, her tone dispassionate but no less full of power. As 
she goes the runes on the sarcophagus and runes etched into the wood of the 
bookshelves begin to flare brightly then fade. 
 
   As the last ones begin to glow, a phantasmal creatures throws the heavy 
stone lid of it's sarcophagus up and at Zendfrel with monstrous strength. A 
haunting and ear splitting wail issues from the wraiths mouth as it rises, 
expecting its magically charged scream to render the intruding half-blood's 
mind to a pool of madness.
 
   Still smiling her polite smile as she assumes a wraithlike form as well to 
allow the marble slab to fly through her, Zendfrel taps her ear with a painted 
fingernail, as she responds calmly in a ghostly voice, {c"What was that? I'm 
sorry, practicing my deafening spell a little bit." 
 
   {xLifting a hand as she chuckles mirthlessly she, recites a few powerful 
words of the arcane and the wraiths scream is cut short as it is sucked into the 
mouth of the inanimate corpse. The thing flings itself straight upwards crashing 
into the ceiling then falling back to the ground, limbs flailing, screaming out 
with two magically charged voices as two trapped souls fight for control over 
one "living space". As the two spirits wrestle, Zendfrel uses the distraction to 
re-animate the corpse as her own, attempting to pull the reigns of both souls to 
her will. After nearly a half hour of battle, of battle in which Zendfrel nearly 
loses her own body to the strong willed souls  in their attempt to return to flesh 
dead or living, she finally binds both of them to the Zombie.
 
   Reaching into the folds of her robes and taping her ears with a dispelling 
wand, Zendfrel says {c"Now that we understand our circumstance, let's have a 
more pleasant conversation, eh? I am your mistress now, you will obey, you're 
souls are bound. It seems a powerful wizard and his faithful guardian you both 
were in life but so many centuries of neglect have left your powers withering 
but not your knowledge. Over the next few days we will be cataloging this 
wonderful treasure you have amassed for me and chatting about the wonders 
of magic. Specifically, undeath and soul magic. I'm sure at least one of you has 
a lot to say say on the subject. "{x 
 
   With a wicked laugh she spends the next half hour sending wave after 
wave of necromantic compulsion and tormenting magic into the wretched 
creature, torturing it into submission for future use.

Stepping out of the hole, her clothes cleaned magically and her thoughts 
clear from the concentration and meditation she puts into her devious magic, 
she walks forward to greet the nice sky once more. Barely passed the fourth 
hour of the day, the Black moon is well and visible in the sky, seemingly casting 
an appreciative black "glow" upon her.  Taking only a moment to churn the 
earth back over the hole to make it no more than a dip in the ground, making 
sure to cover it with the dying weeds and brambles covering the other 
mausoleums and tombs, Zendfrel fades out of existence and steps into the void 
again.
 
   This time she appears in the bedroom of a small house. The trappings of 
the Qualinesti elves can be seen everywhere, from the furniture to the clothes 
hanging about. Laying in a lavishly appointed bed is a middle aged elf, still 
beautiful and graceful as their race tends to stay, and a his lovely younger wife. 
His features, even in sleep, hold a certain hardness to them often reserved for 
the criminal of mind. 
 
   Turning to listen quietly for stirring in the rest of the house, Zendfrel 
waves her hand, and several hidden glyphs glow briefly throughout the 
imparting deafness and mind numbing weariness into the flesh of the elf's 
children and wife.  Then nothing. Zendfrel simply stands there, watching the elf 
sleep for nearly an hour. As the sands of time drizzle away, her features twist 
into a visage that few in this world have ever seen on her face. Hatred, pure 
and utter loathing that would make Takhisis beam with pride to witness 
envelopes her. Soon though, her fist shaking, breath heavy, and nostrils flaring 
as she grinds her teeth , she closes her eyes taking several more minutes to 
compose herself. 
 
   Finally, the glow of the approaching sun just below the horizon warming 
the night sky to a dark crimson, Zendfrel takes action. Summoning a nightmare 
into the room, commanding its silence immediately as it appears, she walks 
forward to brush it's mane. Whispering words forgotten by most, Zendfrel 
takes advantage of a little known feature of the nightmares summoning.  
Named not just for the play on words of the horses horrifying figure, the 
nightmare begins to fade into a phantasmal being and gallops soundlessly and 
slowly, as if through water towards the elf, shrinking as it goes. 
 
   Soon the creature disappears from the material plane all together to run 
through the elf's dreamscape. As it's hooves strike the ground of the poor elf's 
mind they reverberate through it with horrible images to the sound of charging 
horses. For the elf a small half-eleven girl child appears, covered in the blood of 
her parents who's corpses lay behind her she digs, clawing the earth with 
fingernails broken and bleeding as she works through magical compulsion. 
Staring up at the elf with tear streaked eyes which hold no color, only 
blackness, she whispers dark accusation and promises of retribution.
 
   After a few hours of this the elf bolts upright nearly throwing his wife 
from the bed to be greeted by nothing but the warm, cloudless morning sky 
watching him through his bedroom window. His body cold and clammy, sheets 
drenched with sweat he looks down at his hands, seeing for one horrific 
moment blood. Screaming, then wincing and screaming again as his wife slaps 
him angrily at being upset by the sudden movement and scream, the elf jumps 
out of bed and opens his door to the rest of the house, running to check on his 
kids who stare at him with sleepy eyed confusion. 
 
   Playing out almost exactly the same in three other houses throughout 
Qualinesti, three other men are left with haunting visions from their past once 
again, having had these strange dreams for months now. Though these men all 
know each other through the very same act that haunts them they do not dare 
seek each other out, misery may desire company, but guilt is a lonely burden.

*Atop Dargaard, a storm rages. Thunder cracks and lightning flashes across the
cold night sky, rain falling in sheets over the cold, damp earth. Amidst one
of the tallest peaks, a face familiar to the lands can be seen, surrounded by
a group of followers. There is a flash of lightning, revealing the faces of
Nayato Grendul and Mikhal Enemius standing side by side. The Lich Lord raises
a hand, prompting silence of the horde, and the General speaks coldly...*
 
"{DFor too long... this army, His people, have been dormant... It is their only
option before they accept the gift... But now, with it, there are no excuses.{X"
 
*Nayato throws his hood back, revealing his rotting face, a snarling grin
marking his features. The rain wets his jet black hair as he continues.*
 
"{DAeleth has given us a grand... marvelous gift... And you all shall take it
for granted NO LONGER! The Vessel, the Lich Lord, and our very own Undead
Alchemist have entrusted faith in all of you, to give you the gift... Though
some were chosen more exclusively than others...{X"
 
*His eyes pan over those gathered. Countless skeletons, zombies, wraiths,
liches, flesh golems, and other forms of undead stretch as far as the eye can
see, and further. Red eyes pierce the night sky wherever the light doesn't or
can't reach, the very light consumed by the dark presence manifested. Among
the front ranks of those gathered are those that were specifically chosen,
hand picked by Aeleth's most trusted servants.*
 
"{DThey disappoint the most... They have such power... I know... and yet they
let it go to waste...{X"
 
*Nayato looks to the dark clerics, Grienella and Shivask, and as they look to
the night sky, an unholy fire rains down, a glorious display of dark power.
The Lich Lord's eyes move to what appears to be an oddly shaped clump of mud,
and from it emerges Arthelias, accompanied by a thunderous drum, held by
the dark bard, Artagel. As the drum beats steadily, eerie tunes can be heard
escaping the instrument of Atifrandam. The noise is suddenly distorted, as two
mages ominously float up, a shockwave freezing the falling rain in place, only
to then scatter it in all directions violently. The faces, though scarcely
seen, are recognized as none other than Halig and Adrastos. A dark grin crosses
Nayato's features once more, as his gaze turns to Xavier, as Xavier speaks.*
 
"{yLet us not forget why He has bestowed us with such power... He has allowed us
to embrace Death. With Death, comes life. A new life! Power unrivaled by any
other force that Ansalon has seen, or ever will see!{X"
 
*Xavier throws his hands apart, his robes coming open, and a massive swarm of
undead insects flowing from within them, blotting out what little light Nuitari
would shed over Dargaard. Nayato begins to speak once more.*
 
"{DOur power will be known! We will be dormant no more! None shall be ignorant to
the force of Aeleth. They shall be struck down, and risen again against their
own in His name!{X"
 
*Mikhal takes the form of a wraith, floating up as his long broken body shakes.
He begins to speak, his voice echoing as if it came from every minion that
stood before him.*
 
"{DThe power he speaks of is truly unrivaled. Had it been any less I would have
perished long ago. However, as the moons pass, generations travel with them,
and yet here I stand, before a true army of those who share that same gift...{X"
 
*Suddenly emerging from the crowd walks a handsome man wearing a simple black
robe. As Mikhal spots him, his words stop cold, and he quickly abandons his
wraith-like form, dropping to the ground on his knees. Nayato, awe-struck,
sheds his robes, revealing the large tattoo of a yellow goat's skull across
his torso, and he drops to his knees as well. The Vessel and Alchemist soon
follow suit, as well as all other gathered. The power felt can't be mistaken,
and the man gives up his guise, exploding from his human form in a bloody pulp,
revealing a bloated satyr with a goat skull head. The rain suddenly stops, the
lightning and thunder with it, and every being in attendance drones the same
two words. They echo over all of Dargaard...*

*{YI actually wrote this as my background. I didn't mean for it to be so long, but I guess I was in the moment. Anyways, I didn't proof read it nor am I going to make any changes or add on to it to make it more interesting. I'm just posting it for those who care to understand my character, although, don't confuse this story with an ic note as it is purely ooc{x*
 
Zeke, once known for his malevolent behavior and abnormal elation from
heartless torture, is now a veteran in the ranks of the Knights of
Takhisis. When he was given birth into the world of Krynn, his level of
perception was of top notch. Not many years passed and he grew to hate his
existence for the other draconian's feared him, and to him, this meant he
was alone.
He supposed he had Takhisis, the only thing that should have mattered to
him, but he felt nothing from her. Giving up the name that was given to
him and his last name that revealed his lineage, he picked up the name
Zeke, although his youth caused a grammatical error in his spelling.
Lust eventually fueled Zeak, bringing him out to be a monster out on a
battlefield. Off the battlefield, he cured his lust by tearing criminals
and survivors apart with his magic. Awkward as it may seem, Zeak was a
crimson Aurak, his scales always tainted by blood. It took many years for
wisdom to catch up with Zeak. With unnaturally high level of perception
and intelligence, Zeak began to question things: his existence, his
purpose, the knight's wars and battles, and ultimately Takhisis herself.
Unfortunately for Zeak, his new found strength became his downfall. Too
intelligent for his own good, Takhisis threw away the draconian, leaving
him to be befallen by whatever the world could throw at him. At this
point, Zeak left the dragon armies and ventured the world by himself,
covered in disguise. Not driven to fight anymore, Zeak eventually lost his
blood lust and the nature that went with it. Zeak was now level-headed and
could think clearly before any action, something he was never capable of
doing.
With much free time on his hands, Zeak put his time into the only thing he
had left; magic. His independent studies did well for him, but his
loneliness only grew in time. But loneliness wasn't the only thing that
grew; Zeak's barrier to teach himself grew as well and he was forced to
search for others to help him cross that point.
This proved to be difficult for Zeak as he had been away from civilization
for decades, only talking to a few people in common. Even more so, the
group he was trying to contact was none other than the Conclave.
Although it was inconclusive to Zeak, he had always wondered what the
Conclave had feared most about him. Regardless of what it was, the
Conclave never budged at Zeak's pleads and sometimes attacked him. Being a
mage himself and aware of many of the attacks, Zeak usually came out of
them unscathed. Unlike the young Zeak, the Zeak at that time had matured
and felt no reason to kill the Conclave members. Probably because of this,
a certain black robed mage took pity and give Zeak a few items, this
included; a staff, some spell components, and an intermediate spell book.
With this, Zeak trained again for many years until he grew displeased with
his lifestyle once again. Returning to the Knights of Takhisis, Zeak was
treated worse than a gully dwarf, but for some reason the Queen took pity
for his life was not forfeit. Zeak took the chores that were given to him
without question, and he was content with this. He had no hunger to fill
and his urge to serve Takhisis was non-existent, but his life felt as ease
here tending to the lives of the knights.
A few people, humans and draconians alike, first thought it was a great
idea to make fun of Zeak and for a time; this turned out to be a myriad of
enjoyment to them up until Zeak thought it best to set the tables strait.
Zeak had become a powerful magic user and this had caught the eyes of some
of the officials after some unfortunate accident. Although Zeak hated
harming others without good reason, he felt no remorse for what he did,
and apparently the officials felt the same while giving him a position in
the Thorn Knights.
Wizened and old, Zeak now views things his own way and his only drive is
for personal gain. Even then, he finds most things to be undesirable. His
biggest satisfaction is living his life the way he wants to and with that,
his love for his mother means nothing to him. This sometimes worries the
other knights, but nothing has ever happened because of his lack of faith,
which most eventually came to the conclusion that Zeak was given up upon ignoring his existence.

The wind howls and whips around Dargaard mountain, swooping over stone
outcropping's and penetrating crevices.  On the west side of the mountain on
a ledge the wind picks up an ash off a corpse and dances it in the air until
landing it gently on the cheek of Arlanthis.  He stares down at the charred
remains of the corpse, at the twisted grimace of death it wears, with a sad
look.  A single tear runs down his cheek, collecting the ash with it and
leaving a dark stain in its wake as it slides down his face and falls on the
ground next to the corpse.  Like all things here, even the soil starves for
life,dry and devoid of nutrients it instantly absorbs the tear.  He then
drops to one knee,whispering a silent prayer, he closes the blank eyes of
the corpse and closes his fist around a simple symbol of Mishakal it wears. 
Holding it for a moment he unclasps it and puts it in a pocket on the inside
of his breastplate as he stands and wipes the tear stain from his face.  He
looks down for just a moment longer before a mans voice yelling behind him
breaks him from his trance.  He snarls in annoyance and the stench of the
burned flesh he just realizes he can smell and turns to the man approaching,
"What is it Valnor?"  The man stops to catch his breath as he gets to
Arlanthis and gives a strange glance at the burnt body laying behind him as
he barely recognizes the face of a young cleric who died to an arrow wound
on this very mountain many battles ago.  "Im ready for your messag...  I
recognize that body m'lord."  "Yes, our dead are not sacred here.  The very
brothers and sisters who fight alongside us will be fighting against us
after death.  There is no goodness left in this place."  He pauses for a
moment remembering how nervous the young girl was to join the crusaders on
their last raid, and how he soothed her with assurances the gods will watch
over her.  And even after the arrow struck her neck and her life slipped out
her eyes, the gods frowned upon her again and let her corpse be reanimated
and further desecrated.  Arlanthis leans in close to the ear of the corpse
and whispers "Fear not sister, for your tormentors are quick to follow."  He
then kisses the forehead of the woman and turns to the man, "Burn all the
bodies, but burn our fallen brothers and sisters separately from the rest." 
He says this turning and looking out over a massive field of twisted and
burning corpses.  Men throw disfigured corpses and bones into huge pyres
constructed throughout the field.  Mercenaries pick through the remains of
the undead, scavenging rings,clothing, anything of worth from the fallen
clan."  We have purged the undead from the land, our names shall be
remembered and those that have lost their lives in this pursuit.  Send word
to the High Priestess that though im sure we will see a few stragglers that
we missed, for now...  The Dargaard pass is safe."  He then unties the
clasps on his breastplate and lets it fall to the ground.  "You and your men
have done well."  Tossing a bag of coins to the man, "Treat your men tonight
in Solanthus, I will see that they have a warm meal and proper rest."  The
man grins,salutes, then runs back down the mountain side to a large camp
with his mercenarys.  Arlanthis can hear cheering and singing as he turns
and looks out over the land toward the port o call, wind wiping his hair. 
"Your will be done O Sword of Justice.  The wicked reap what they sow."  He
just stands and stares out over the land for quite some time before
returning to his tent.  As he lays his head on his cot and can barely hear a
voice in the back of his head "Only the Knights of Tahkisis remain...." 
Arlanthis lets out a heavy sigh and closes his eyes, drifting into slumber,
already thinking of a declaration to send the black knights.

The sun rises on a new day and Arlanthis kneels in prayer next to his
camp cot inside his tent.  A small figurine of the Sword of justice sits on
a simple wooden box in front of him.  The melted down remains of a candle
lays next to it, the thin remains of a wisp of smoke still slither off the
stump.  Arlanthis kneels on the ground in a soiled white tunic and pants,
evidence of a long night of feverish sweats and no sleep.  All through the
night has he prayed, as he often does, for his god is silent to his prayers.
All manner of questions fly from his mind like birds scattering from a
congregation on a tree, anything in the hopes of warranting a response." 
Why am I here?  What do you want from me?  What is my purpose?"  Only to
name a few.  Over and over, all through out the night.  Through
fever,chills,and vomiting.  Over and over he asks only to be answered with
silence.  And here he lays, near broken and at whits end."  Is this how I am
to die?  Alone from fever in the night?!"  Frustrated he slams a weak fist
into the dry and lifeless soil, taking a handful of the grainy sand and
letting it fall from his fingers."  In this place?  The very trail of
Dargaard my men gave their life just to make a little safer for future
travelers?  Is this not what you wanted of us?!"  In his despair he lowers
his head to weep and the sweat from his brow forms into a single bead,
pulling away from his face to live its last moments in free fall before
being absorbed by the dry ground.  Its at this moment that the first rays of
the sun breach the flap of his tent, casting a beam of light through the
smoke filled room onto the figurine.  He finds steel in his resolve and digs
his knuckles into the ground, "If this is your wish then so be it, I am
yours."  Suddenly the bead defies gravity and pulls back onto his face,
denied its final end.  A thought comes into his mind.  Not as if someone
speaking to him or even whispering.  More a memory of being whispered to." 
Go to the city."  Is that what it said?  Is he trying to remember someone
else's memories or is it his own?  No.  Suddenly the fever recedes, strength
returns to his limbs and his mind clears.  Somehow he knows what he heard
and what he must do.  Rising he says, "I know not my destination but the
path has been laid before me, I thank you."  Already tightening the straps
on his armor.  With zeal in his heart and a vigor to his step he throws the
tent flap back and steps out into the morning light, a new man.  Not the
least surprised to see Sinjin fully armored and standing by two horses, the
rest of the men already saddled behind him.  "Its the strangest thing.."  He
goes to say but Arlanthis cuts him short with a hand and a smile."  I know
brother, I am ready."  Sinjin smiles and Arlanthis slides onto his horse,
the two men riding off toward the city with full company in tow.  A twinkle
in their eye and purpose in their hearts.

The men approach the city to see a lone knight awaiting them before the
gates.  Arlanthis and Sinjin pull up and the men all stand and exchange a
silent understanding.  Surely he must have felt it too.  Purpose has entered
the heart of this man as well and it can be seen in his eyes.  He turns
horse and leads the men into the city, men lining the walls and gate towers
look down with solemn faces.  They gallop through the market, woman men and
children all stare at them with the same blank expressions.  Something tells
Arlanthis to stop and the two men continue on, turning down temple row and
disappearing around a corner.  Arlanthis stares around at the people for a
moment, blank expressions on them all.  He slowly dismounts and realizes
these people wear the same face the men on the walls wore.  Sadness, no
hope.  Why has he not seen this before?  He comes to this city often,
recently in fact.  Why does he just now notice this?  What is this?  And it
hits him.....  Despair.  Abandoned by thier leaders and protectors, devoid
of the words of the gods of good.  Despair has crept into the hearts of the
citizens here.  For long now thieves, marauders and all manner of
lawlessness has plagued them.  Devoid of the safe embrace of justice and the
law, cold despair has made its home.  What seems like moments but is really
an eternity pass and Sinjin returns with the man who is later introduced as
Xanzabar.  Sinjin pulls up next to Arlanthis and looks down at him, almost
past him to the ground."  I have been chosen by a council to take the oath,
live by the measure, and become the new High Warrior of the Solamnics.  I
have accepted, and you will join me."  Feeling in his soul the weight of an
old duty being replaced by a new, Arlanthis looks up and salutes Sinjin with
a smile before spinning and turning to the recently gathered crowd near him,
"Hail, Sinjin, High Warrior!"  And the crowd burst into cheers.  Every
man,woman, and child rejoice together as the despair left in their hearts
fades and is replaced by hope.  Laughter and celebration carry on through
out the night and when the sun finally rises it brings with it a new dawn,
in a new age.

a light hint of mist keeps her pleasently cool.  Pleasent.

A woman sat in the back courner of a dark jail cell somewhere
in Palanthas.  Lucky enough to have the cell to herself, she
stares into the quiet darkness, footsteps of guards patroling
the only thing reminding her she wasen't alone.
 
Smoke rised lightly from a blunt in her right hand, a small
comfort she was lucky enough to sneak in.  'Good thing they
don't check -everywhere-,' the woman thought to herself.  She
raised the blunt up to her mouth and took a long drag from
it, coughing lightly so as not to arouse any attention from
the guards.
 
Ever since she got hooked to the precious green herb, she
hasen't had an...incident for months.  The influence of the
drug has made her do some stupid shit recently, but at least...
at least it was better then the blackouts.  Better then
being in pain, and being scared.  Better then waking up in
some random alley or in the forests to find that she had been
covered in blood, from events beyond her to recall.
 
'What's wrong with me?  I hate this...'  She raised the blunt
to her mouth, taking another drag from it, hoping that the high
of the drug would continue to do its job, and at least keep her
from losing herself again.  Even though anything was better then
that, she sat in the jail cell, miserable at what she let her
life crumble into.
 
Was she clinically insane?  Perhaps.  She could still recall the
days of her childhood, being raised on a facility for being "mad."
She had overheard the priests there, talking about their theories
of her being possessed.  The thought made her shiver, and forced
her to take another drag off of the blunt.
 
She couldn't blame her actions entirely on the blunts she so craved
to keep the blackouts from happening.  She knew that on some strange
and twisted reason, she liked being locked up, as long as it was
only for a while.  It made her feel safe, despite the lack of comforts
and the cold treatment of the guards.  Was it the fact that she
knew being locked up, she couldn't do anything she would regret?
Or, was it because there were others here that had the same kind of
problems on their plate.  After all, misery loves company.
 
She took one last drag and hid the smoked-out blunt under a loose
rock.  "All out," she said.
 
She rolled over in her courner and went to sleep to the sound
of patrolling guards.

Trickhal Amenius lays cold and alone on a pile of straw deep in a
Solamnic dungeon.  Slowly etching away at vertical lines he's carved into a
forgotten corner of his cell.  Anything to take his mind off the wails and
moans of others to share his fate, and to provide a way to count the days in
this god forsaken place.  Every third guard rotation means another day has
gone by.  He chuckles to himself in the dim lighting of a far away torch,
"What a fool you are to have placed yourself here this time Trickhal.  And
for adultry!"  He talks to himself as a way of motivation, always telling
himself "Your not crazy until you talk back."  A rule he has not followed
for some time, a mark received by those who spend too long here."  To think
you could sleep with a knight's wife and get away with it.  Fool!  I thought
he wouldn't find out.  Of course he would find out.  Just shut up!"  He
catches himself again before he slips down the slope of insanity."  Another
close one my friend."  He decides to turn his attention back to etching the
stone before he loses his mind for good.  Suddenly there is a commotion down
the corridor, followed by footsteps and the loud clang of armor.  Then a new
light begins to push back the tendrils of darkness at the corner and mens
voices ring out.  Trickhal rushes to the bars on his cell to have a look
just as several wardens drag a screaming man, bound and shackled, down the
hallway and toss him in a cell with a loud snap of the door.  The man cries
and wails for mercy as the wardens turn and walk off, leaving a lone
familiar knight standing in the corridor.  Trickhal chuckles to himself and
slinks back down to the floor of his cell, saying quietly to himself as if
to the newly arrived prisoner."  Be strong my new friend, sinners and
insanity will be your only company now."

Arlanthis frowns to himself as the man in the cell begs and pleads for
mercy, forswearing all oaths of evil he has made and condemning his god and
past brethren.  Such lack of honor and self respect, does he not know he
cannot escape justice anymore than he can escape the eyes of the gods.  His
dark queen will be waiting for him in the darkness.  Arlanthis smiles to
himself for only a second before turning on heel and marching proudly down
the stone,torch lit corridors of the Solamnic dungeon.  Guards salute him as
he passes and prisoners beg and plead with out stretched arms.  Arlanthis
can barely hold back the urge to spit and remove the bitter taste from his
mouth to see men act in such a way.  Criminals and the weak of faith, all of
them.  Fools to think they could break the law in Palanthas and not pay the
price.  For days now crime has been on the rise and for days now Arlanthis
has filled the dungeons.  He approaches the Jailers desk and signs his name,
another addition to a long row of his name.  He smiles to himself as the
Jailer salutes and thinks "I will have to petition to have the dungeon
expanded at this rate."  He chuckles and makes his way up the twisting
stairs,back into the light, back into the world where justice reigns
supreme, made so by his hand and that of his brethren."  I thank you my god
for granting me another day of breath that I may do your work.  May you
smile upon your servant as I enforce the will of justice.  As long as I draw
breath criminals and the wicked will never walk freely in Palanthas." 
Arlanthis prays quietly as he walks out into the light.  Servant of justice.

It was a cold, dark night in the city of Palanthas.  The normal city activities
were put to rest for the night, and the citizens of Palanthas were happily
asleep in their beds.  However, at all times of the day, be it when the sun
shines or the moons rise, trouble always lurks.
 
A group of three people, riding on horseback, were just making the transition
from Temple Row to Noble's way.  The three people, two men and one woman,
came to a halt outside of the Palanthas stables.  Silently, one man looked
to the other two, giving them both a nod.  All three moved their horses closer
to the stables and slid off.  The woman tended to tethering the horses while
the two men cautiously pulled forth weapons.  After tethering the last horse,
the woman looked to the two and nodded, at which point, they approached the
door.
 
The man in front reached for the doorknob, which with the slightest touch,
began to open.  The man in front pulled his hand back, giving the other two
a troubled look.  "Door's unlocked," he whispered, "Not good.  Keep your eyes
out."  The two nodded, and the point man turned back to the door, pushing it
open slowly.  The stable was dimly lit by a couple of torches for the whole
facility.  From inside there was no sign of movement or sound.  The man
gritted his teeth, gripping his weapon firmly, and proceeded in.
 
The sound of straw against the bottoms of their feet was the only sound to
be heard.  The lead man gestured to the other two, motioning the woman to
take right and the other man to take left.  They did so, keeping eyes peeled
for anything unusual.  As the point man closed in on the far end of the stable,
he saw a large lump of straw saturated in blood.  "Blood," he said aloud, as
a warning to the other two.  Zoned in on the sight before him, he approached
slowly, too focused to notice the lack of response from his team mates.  He
kneeled down next to the straw, and started sifting through it.  He stopped
when his hand hit something hard, and he grasped onto it and pulled it out.
 
As the object came into view, he gave a startled jump to his feet and droped it
like hot iron.  "Shit!" he yelled silently to himself; it was a bloody hand.  He
turned swiftly around, saying outloud, "We need to get the he-UgGghhoo.." He gargled
on his own blood and fell to the floor, an awaiting stiletto having cut through 
the bare flesh of the man's neck.  A intimidating man, dressed in his trade of
black, pulled out a crimson red cloth and began wiping blood off of his weapon. 
 
While looking down and admiring his work, the sound of saw dust falling from a
wooden support uptop caught his attention.  He turned his gaze upward, undoubting
of his keen eyes to spot a nuisance, saw nothing.  Better then take a risk, he
sheathed his weapon and turned to make a quick get-out.  As he turned towards
the door, an unseen force, like the feeling of two well-placed feet, smashed
into his chest and sent him flying.  Instincts kicking in, the man flipped to
his feet, never dropping momentum, and dived out of a closed window.  Shattered
glass sprayed everywhere, but the invisible stalker dashed straight after the
man, diving into the window just behind.  The chase was on.

The night life of Palanthas cannot be called anything less then an intrigue.
An endless story, full of plots and twists.  To look out the window at night
would more or less mean to be watching in on someone's shady workings and
bargins.
 
Down Tower District, the sound of incredibly fast running, from two sources,
could be heard.  A man dressed in black, as black as the night, dived forward
and tumbled, hiding behind the corner of a building.  He reached into his
cloak and pulled out a wicked dagger, bracing himself with calm coordination
to remove the head of his stalker.  One... two... three... nothing.  That
means...
 
"Got ya, bitch!"  Prepared enough, he dived and tumbled forward, ignoring
the sound of crashing behind him as he booked back into a full run.  "FUCK!"
he heard from behind him; he was too close, and needed to make some distance.
The sign to "The Three Moons," appealed to him, and he bashed the door open,
taking refuge inside.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Melody gripped onto the side of her arm, having slammed into it pretty bad.
She wasen't one to stop for pain, however.  He was going to get away if she
did.  She rushed towards the busted down door of "The Three Moons," and
charged in, diving to the side and behind a shelf of store goods.  She peered
in between the potion vials and other things, catching her breath and looking
for a sign of her quarry.  That last screw up cost her her invisibility.
Without turning her attention away from her environment, she pulled out a
potion and popped the lid.  She greedily consumed the disgusting thick slop,
and was rewarded with a veil to hide behind.
 
Slowly, she risked standing up.  Her blue eyes pierced into the darkness, a
blessing of being half breed.  The pain going through her arm had calmed down
by now, and she had reached to her hip, pulling out twin daggers.  Each step
she took made no noise, despite the wooden flooring.  She encircled her way
around the store, seeing no sign of hostility.  She rounded the corner of a
shelf, and she felt a wire tug at her waist.  A corresponding jar fell to the
ground and crashed, and as she whirled around, she was knocked over and pinned
down.
 
Feeling out the motions, she lifted her right hand and barely managed to catch
the wrist of a dagger-wielding, unseen hand.  "Took my damn tactic, bitch!" she
yelled with frustration.  She kicked him off, lifting herself with her arms and
swinging with her legs to flip backwards onto her feet.  The sound of rushing
was heard, and the pieces of the cracked door were heard being banged again.
She went from standing to a dash, and was stalking again.

The wind blew gently across the Palanthian night sky.  A young woman
unseen by the naked eye was running at her full speed down an alley.
The night had been eventful, and she was not used to putting forward
this much effort.  She almost stopped in wonder to as if whether or
not she was getting herself into more then she could handle.
 
She came around the corner of the alley, having her question answered
for her.  'Dead end,' came the thought to Melody.  She found herself
staring at three buildings conjoined, making it impossible for the
average person to go any further, with a building height of thirty
feet.  However, she was anyone but average...
 
A bolt whizzed by her head, her eyes catching it only lifesparingly
shorter then its speed, and enough time for her reflexes to kick in.
 
'Neither is he,' She thought, on the topic of average.  She looked
to the top of the building to see the man she was chasing, one leg
ontop of the edge of the building, one arm bent halfway up and bearing
a crossbow, and the wind rippling his cloak gently.  The full moon
of Solinari stood behind him in defiance, and the image of general
finesse this man gave off so naturally pissed her off.  "Fuck you,"
she yelled, frantically started climbing / running up the side
of the building.  He turned, and disappeared as she scaled.
 
Within seconds, Melody pulled herself up to the top of the building,
and straight across from her was her target.  She reached to her
hips, slowly sliding out her daggers as she approached the man.
He had his back to her, but as she approached, he turned around, opening
his arms and stepping up onto the side of the building.
 
"Don't try it this time.  I got your ass, fare and square," Melody snarled
at the man.
 
"This is where the silly games end," said the man, giving the hint of an
accent to Melody.
 
Melody continued to step forward, her muscles tensing and her heart pounding.
She was going to have to make this go down flawless.  She knew, as much
as she hated it, that he was every bit as quick as her.  However, was he
going to read her movements right?
 
"What's the matter?  You scurr'ed?  You ain't got no game, you ain't got no
skill, and you ain't got no talent boy,"  Melody spat out as a taunt.
 
"Boy?"  He said.  She could pick at the tone in his voice; he wasen't amused.
 
"You are quite funny to me," he continued.  He popped the top of a potion
in his hand and downed it, tossing it over his shoulder.  One arm went to
his side, while the other reached out to Melody, beckoning her forward.
 
She charged at him, ready to take her and him plummeting to the ground
to get the bastard.  As she lunged, he jumped back and was... FLYING!?
"Shit, shit, shit, shit, SHIT!"  She yelled, as she found herself unable
to stop, plummeting towards the ground.  *CRACK* she heard clearly from
her left arm as she landed, and pain seared through her.  She looked up
at the man to see him still floating in air.  He lingered for a moment,
and then flew up and away, into the night sky.
 
"Damnit," Melody said.  "Got away..."  She stood up, pain slowly throbbing
to its height in her arm.  She spat at the ground, looking up one more
time, before slinking into the quiet of the night.

OOC this is just an edited story of what happened the other night for
those that weren't there and just havn fun.  Enjoy.  The sun sets on the
city of Palanthas and a lone beam of light shoots down through the high
glass windows of Paladine's Temple.  A place where men and women alike come
to find faith, only this eve, a man has come to lose his.  Marshal Arlanthis
Breeze lies crumpled on the cold stone floor, singing the sounds of sorrow
to a tune of weeping.  The lone beam of light reflecting off the Solamnic
seal of his breastplate, carelessly tossed next to him."  Why!!!"  He cries
as he raises his fists to the heavens in anguish,"Whyyyyyy!!!"  .  Clerics
and priests stand back and gasp, before them a man losing his faith, a
broken man."  LEAVE ME!"  The man yells as he unsheathes his sword and sends
it sliding across the floor with a toss."  I have been cursed!"  He yells
again."  My faith taken from me, tainted."  This time quietly to himself. 
The crowd stands frozen in shock, unable to understand what they see. 
Suddenly a voice pierces the moment, "Arlanthis!"  Recognizing the voice as
soon as he hears it, Arlanthis lowers his head to conceal his tear stained
face.  The voice calls out again, "Arlanthis...  Are you alright?"  Hearing
the footsteps approach he is prepared for Muira's sweet smell, but he could
never be prepared for her touch.  He twitches as her soft hand touches his
face, to long absent a woman's touch."  Please Muira.."  He says as their
eyes meet and he sees her recognition of his sorrow."  I have lost my faith,
and question that which i held most dear.  For long has my faith been
absolute, and now..

It betrays me."  A single tear runs down his face and Muira tenderly
wipes it away.  Arlanthis looks into her eyes and says, "What is a man
without his faith?  What is a sword with no arm to wield it."  He turns from
her confused face and looks to the east, staring through the wall."  I do
not expect you to understand but there is something I must do."  With that
he turns and goes for the temple door, much to her dismay.  As he approaches
the massive threshold he turns and yells to the heavens, "I denounce my
Oaths!  And you!"  .  With that he's gone, running down the hall, out into
the square, and on to his horse.  Kicking the horse into a full gallop, he
storms down temple row, guards and men making way with puzzled looks.  He
rides and rides, pushing the horse full speed down High Knights Road and
through the High Clerists Tower.  Faster and faster he pushes his horse,
harder and harder, until finally at the base of the mountains of Dargaard
its heart gives out and it slows to a trot, drops to a knee, and dies. 
Arlanthis rolls out the saddle and pats the horses nose, "Faithful to the
end..."  He frowns and gazes upon all he has ever known.  The mountain of
death.  Sadness and sorrow mask his weariness and fuel him as he begins to
climb the mountain he knows so well.  Coming to a familiar clearing he comes
across what he's been looking for.  An emissary of the Undead."  What have
you come for?"  The voice hisses from the shadows."  Arlanthis pauses for a
moment to catch his breath then turns and stares out over the plain of
Throt.  "I have come to speak to the Lich....."

After several exchanges and a small gathering appearing, the Lich finally
arrives.  Arlanthis can tell his approach from the smell of old bones and
death he has come to associate with him, and the chill that goes down his
spine."  The time has come has it Breeze?"  The shrill voice pierces the
air.  Continuing to look out over the plane Arlanthis simply reply's, "It
has.."  He can feel the grin slime its way across Mikhals face behind him. 
A skeletal looking hand reach's past his shoulder and presents a jar.  The
dark liquid inside he knows already to be his own blood.  Arlanthis takes
the jar and stares out over the plain, reflecting his own life.  Behind him
a commotion can be heard and a voice cries out, "Arlanthis don't do this!" 
."  I have forsaken my Oaths Terris, and with it my faith.  All I have ever
known is crusading against the undead, watching my fallen brothers raise
time and again.  Secretly knowing that it was one day my fate as well.  Well
the day has come!  I go to join my brothers and sisters.  It cannot be
fought, against it there is no hope."  Arlanthis can feel that grin again. 
Suddenly that sweet smell again and his heart drops just as the voice cries
out, "I will go with you!"  Arlanthis turns and reach's out his free hold
and clutches the jar of his blood in the next.  "Come with me Muira. 
Eternal life....  In death I can love you like I couldn't in life.  I will
love you forever."  She hesitates and trembles for a moment before turning
in tears saying "I'm sorry, I cant."  And with that.....  She was gone.

Watching Mui go was like watching his faith go all over again, a final
tear runs down Arlanthis' face, all that he has left.  He stands frozen,
with arm extended, heart and soul broken.  Nothing left.  Nothing left but
hate.  It takes his last ounce of strength to lower his hand and break from
the memory of her leaving.  He turns and looks out over the plain again,
stale wind of death blowing through his hair.  From deep within he
proclaims, "I will always love you Muira."  He pops the lid on the jar, "And
I will kill them all."  He drinks.

Childhood memories haunt this young man daily.  Life was prosperous at
first, he grew up in a small mansion built away from any busy city, with his
mother and father.  Being an only child, he would wonder around lonely many
times, but at the same time growing up more mature as a result.  Sitting in
front of a small pond and thinking deeply and reading from a vast personal
library consumed his free time, while a strict regime of work and practice
of various skills, assigned by his parents, covered the rest.  When Fyrah
was about the age of 10, his house was attacked by a group of thieves.  A
rough bunch, dust-covered faces and an eye for wealth in all of them.  The
only one that stood out being, what was assumed as, their leader.  A brute
of a man, towering above the average sized thieves, carrying a large gelatin
shaped axe on his back.  When they had shown up, Fyrah's parents only had
enough time to hide him under a loose floor board.  Looking up through the
cracks, Fyrah gazed upon the threatening and questioni ng of his parents,
and later their execution by the brute.  Their decapitated heads rolled
along the floor, his mothers head stopping at an angle above the crack Fyrah
looked through, her eyes set on him.  The graphic things he saw that day
never left him, only fueling a want for revenge deep inside him.  Wishing
them all the pain he could bring, Fyrah researched magic from the many books
in his library he didnt pay attention to before.  One school of magic caught
his eye particularly, illusion, how it manipulated the mind and senses, and
when mastered could torture someone from the inside out.  Fyrah had found a
teacher of illusion, paying him with the vast wealth he had gotten from his
old house before leav ing it.  Years past, Fyrah felt confident enough to
confront the group that had raided his home and resulted in his parents
death.  Never forgetting their faces, he traveled from town to town,
relentlessly gathering information till tracking down the group.  He had
tracked the group down to a small cabin-looking building, hidden in the
leaves of a forest.  Upon arrival at the cabin, what he saw forever affect
him.  Opening the door, Fyrah sees the dead bodies of the group.  The bodies
were everywhere; hung over the cha irs, on the floor with fearful looks,
there was even one on burnt onto the roof of the cabin.  On the floor in
front of the entrance to the cabin was a nicely sized white circle
imprinted.  Walking to the nearest town, he had asked what happened to the
group.  The citizens were happy to tell the tale of the group, who had
bullied the citizens in the past.  White robes of the Orders of High Sorcery
came into town one day, heard the stories of the malicious group, and went
to the cabin to confront them.  The rest was a mystery to the citizens, but
the effect was immediate on Fyrah, all his hatred and vengeance drained from
his body, and was replaced by respect for the cause of protecting others. 
He thought, If he could use his strength to prevent others the heartache
that he had endured, all while protecting magic which he has come to
respect, what higher honor could he have?  Researching and finding the
shrine of Solinari, the diety of the white robes, he devoted his life to the
cause.  Being marked, Fyrah stood up and left the shrine, ready to set out
with his new life, freed of his vengeance.

Going about his daily duties, searching for renegades and acts that violate the precepts of Good, he sat atop a tower looking into his scrying bowl. While projecting his vision through a random dark alley way between rows of houses, he catches out of the corner of his eyes a break in. A rather small group of hooligans, causing mischief most likely.
 
Appalled by the petty acts of this group, he stands immediately, summoning a gate and vanishing into it. As he steps out of it, he looks around at the small house he had arrived at, the group of hooligans in front of him, having obviously grabbed their attention. On the floor lied a man, dressed in commoner clothing, a sword protruding from his back. Beside him, a woman with an open throat, still chocking on her own blood.
 
Flashbacks of his own parents deaths rang through Fyrah's mind. The petty hooligans charged him out of fear, only to have their weapons make a soft 'ding' sound as they bounced off Fyrah's Shield spell he had up. Looking forward, not noticing the hooligans at all, Fyrah stands in a daze as memories he hadnt looked back on in years tortured his mind. 
 
Eyes darting about the room, at the death of this common man and woman, noting every small detail that was alike with his own parents cruel end, Fyrah's pulse begins to rise and anger resonates through his body. The vengeance he once had let go of had come back, his mind confusing the situation with his own.
 
Some time had passed before he had ever left that small house, leaving behind only bodies. It was only moments before he put the pieces together, realizing what he had done. Immediately taking refuge in a library near Palanthas, owned by a friend, he began to seek answers in the books around him, but to no avail. 
 
With time he accepted his actions. He accepted the fact that theres both evil, and good. His old admissions' of protecting the 'innocent' seemed so juvenile to him, so absurd. The darkness in his heart, as there is in all others, was present just as much as the light. 
 
Fyrah came to the conclusion that they were both needed. As long as there was Good, Evil would arise to fight it, and vice versa, and that was the order of things. Without that order and constant movement, Krynn would stand still and progress.
 
With this new mindset, he sets out to the towers of the conclave. Having already discarded the white robes he so proudly wore not to long ago, he receives a set of fine red robes.

Thirty.  It's an age where the mistakes of the past are realized, and
more than a passing thought is given to where and how the future should be
spent.  Having reached this age recently, Muira's life has been full of both
good and bad, the woman trying to strongly stand up for what she believes
in, and stay out of certain battles that should not, and do not, concern
her.  Having gotten through her life, up until now, without devoting herself
to worshipping one Divine, Muira has used the time to quietly study each one
while showing the proper respect for each of them even though what they
stand for might contrast with her own ideals.  The long moments pondering,
the careful studying and the endless hours of comparing have come to a halt,
it would seem.  Sitting straight up in bed, in the middle of the night, a
slow smile crosses upon Muira's delicate features, causing her eyes to shine
brightly.  Moving to the flames jumping in the hearth that keep the room
warm, she kneels before them, her hands outstretching, dancing through the
fire as she studies the living flames.  Fire is unbiased...  It can either
help or hinder good or evil.  It is both life and death, it is used to both
destroy and evoke new life...."  Muira whispers to herself as she stares
into the dancing flames.  "I know now that this is the path for me, the
Divine I should choose.  He represents a path of neutrality, not chosing a
side as a way of life, but not discriminating against either.  Quickly
donning her clothing, Muira had set out to find Sirrion's Temple, uncaring
that it's the middle of the night.  Gaining a horse and directions, Muira

Muira: Devotee of Sirrion
Wed May  4 22:03:55 2011
To: Everyone
Thirty.  It's an age where the mistakes of the past are realized, and
more than a passing thought is given to where and how the future should be
spent.  Having reached this age recently, Muira's life has been full of both
good and bad, the woman trying to strongly stand up for what she believes
in, and stay out of certain battles that should not, and do not, concern
her.  Having gotten through her life, up until now, without devoting herself
to worshipping one Divine, Muira has used the time to quietly study each one
while showing the proper respect for each of them even though what they
stand for might contrast with her own ideals.  The long moments pondering,
the careful studying and the endless hours of comparing have come to a halt,
it would seem.  Sitting straight up in bed, in the middle of the night, a
slow smile crosses upon Muira's delicate features, causing her eyes to shine
brightly.  Moving to the flames jumping in the hearth that keep the room
warm, she kneels before them, her hands outstretching, dancing through the
fire as she studies the living flames.  Fire is unbiased...  It can either
help or hinder good or evil.  It is both life and death, it is used to both
destroy and evoke new life...."  Muira whispers to herself as she stares
into the dancing flames.  "I know now that this is the path for me, the
Divine I should choose.  He represents a path of neutrality, not chosing a
side as a way of life, but not discriminating against either.  Quickly
donning her clothing, Muira had set out to find Sirrion's Temple, uncaring
that it's the middle of the night.  Gaining a horse and directions, Muira
traveled for days without rest, exhausting both herself and the horse in the
process.  Finally coming upon the temple, she dismounted, her legs buckling
beneath her from so long upon the creature's back.  Having taken a moment,
she struggled to her feet before entering the sacred walls, beginning a new
chapter in her life.

{D Zeath has lived here in Palanthis all his life.  He as the same
natural talent that his mother had in life; he thinks back to his younger
days before her death.  Life was easy back then.  Though then he was known
by another name.  His mother warned him that Palanthis was not a good place
to practice their art.  But the town had no grave tenders so she took the
job and taught; Him as been tradition in his family; yet she never talked of
his father.  She only said that he had great power and in time he would
also.  Zeath finely deiced it is time to leave Palanthis for he now has a
place to study that is well protected that he does not need to live here any
more where its not safe.  He causes the power of the shadows to grab his
gear and dresses him and leaves his home for the last time.  {D He makes his
way to the graveyard to visit his mothers Tomb one last time.  As he walks
through the streets he ducks down alley ways as he wonders down the ally
way.  As he walks he feel the hunger consume him he needs to feed and soon. 
He wonders the ally ways for some time when he comes across a beggar down on
his luck.  The beggar looks up with pleading brown eyes "{YSir Do {Yyou by
chance have gold to spare."  {D Zeath looks down at the man and a slight
grin comes across his face.  "{mIll make you a deal Ill give you a steel
piece if you help me out with a job{D."  The man agrees to help Zeath.  They
walk a ways till the end up at the grave yard Zeath points to a shed. 
{mThere are a couple of shoves and a pickaxe in there grab them and lets go.
{D They walk towards the back of the grave yard and where there are very few
graves.  {mThis is a good place to start Ill return shortly I must look over
a few other graves.  If you finish this then Ill pay you the steel piece. 
{D The man nods his head and begins getting to work he is a strong man about
average height and roughly a good 250lbs of lean muscle.  Zeath just turns
and walks off to his mothers tomb.  It takes him about five to ten minutes
to walk to Raven moons tomb.  {D Most dont know that his woman was his
mother his mentor in necromancy.  He feels the thirst again he decides he
cant wait any longer he must feed.  He walks back towards the beggar
silently and slowly.  As he walks he utters the arcane words and take on a
wraith like form.  The he mutters the secret knowledge that he has learn
sheathing himself in the protective {Dblack{rflames.  {D the {rflames{D
grant him protection and extra nimbleness.  The beggar been hard at work;
Zeath hovers over the grave {mVery well dont{D The wraith form fades away;
the mans face goes ghostly white and his brow eyes goes wide with fear. 
Zeath drops down into the grave as he does he brings the blade of his shove
across the mans throat and slices it clean open.  Zeath drinks heavy on the

{D The zombie follows Zeath through the graveyard as they walk Zeath gets
a weird feeling to make one last walk by his mothers resting place.  As he

approaches the front of the tomb and a pun the gate is a passage.  Only he

clicking sound as the gates open.  As he opens the gate and proceeds inside
the sound of a great lock unlock is heard deep within the vault along with
the sound of stone moving on stone.  He looks around the inside of the tomb
where the sarcophagus should be there is a set of stairs leading down into a
cavern.  Zeath slowly descends down into the darkness.  As he descends into
the darkness he calls upon the necromantic energy to see as the dead see
granting him infravision and being able to see the invisible.  As he
descends down into the cave he enters a great cavern.  At the other end of
the cavern is a large skeleton that resembles that of a minotaur but on a
much grander scale.  The skeleton voice booms out {YWHO HASTH ENTER THE
SACRED PLACE OF MY MASTER?!!  {D Zeath looks at the skeletons puzzled he
crosses his arms and shifts his weight to one leg as he answers; {mZeath; an

{DHe reads that his father was a great enchanter who had the ability to
control fire; His name was Dezath.  Over the years he became obsessed over
it.  And that power corrupted him and a demons came to him.  It was a small
one in the form of a onyx ball.  And the ball allowed him to see and contact
other lesser demons.  As the mans obsession grew so did the demons that came
to him.  Some where dark and evil others where of good nature trying to set
him back on a path less evil.  Soon the good demons left him alone seeing
there was no use in talking to him for he was too gone.  And months had
passed and as those months turned to years he met a women of Kagonesti
decent.  She was a very powerful necromancer.  She held the power of binding
souls.  He worked with her over the years and they soon grew close.  After
some time the man had found what he was looking for.  A demon made utterly
of darkness and fire.  The enchanter and necromancer worked long and hard
for many years to find a way to bind the demon and to get him to grant
Dezath the power he wanted.  Ravenmoon by time of the great rite in which
they would perform the binding she had fallen in love with him.  Despite
being worried about the him she did not tell Dezath for she did not want to
worry her.  They preformed the right with out fail.  The Demon appeared in
the circle for which she made and he commanded the flames to extinguish
around the demon leaving it weak.  They thought they had tricked the demon. 
But the demon was smarter than they had planned for he had tricked Dezath
into allowing him to take control of his body for one night to feel the
flesh of a mortal.  What Dezath had not known that the demon had planned to
use Ravenmoon as a vessel to bear a child with demonic blood.  But Ravenmoon
knew this and tried to slay the demon before he had his way.  She did not
succeed in her plan till it was too late.  The demon had done what he
wanted.  Ravenmoon had killed the demon though at the very end.  She then
bound the soul of Dezath and the demon within two different weapons.  One
was an shovel that she would leave with her son for which holds the essence
of his father.  An the soul of the demon she bound into the handle of a
whip.  When Zeath finished reading this he looked around the room and
noticed the alter and the items their.  He turns towards the alter and picks
up four items that lay on the table.  A onyx ball, Black robes with the
sleeves removed.  The Robe is a robe of holding.  Then he takes the last two
items.  A whip handle and a black leather hood.  As he puts on the hood
black swirling flames conceal his face.  And when he grips the handle of the
whip a long {Dblack{rflame{D sprouts out from it.  Zeath cackles evil for he
now holds the very nature of him self.  Now all that is left is to figure
out how to bring to fruit the dark power deep within him.  With his items he
rushes out of the tomb.  {mSTAND GUARD ALLOW NONE TO ENTER FOR I AM YOUR NEW
MASTER!  {D.  He hurries out of the tomb as he steps out he locks the tomb
and summons his mighty nightmare.  As he mounts the might beast
{BBLACK{RFLAMES erupt around them and they speeds off through Palanthis
cause all to flee at the sight of him.

Standing above the Tower, the man glances out at the rising storm.  It
will be a massive storm, he knows, dark clouds almost unnatural.  The whole
Grove seemed to draw into itself, in preparation.  And the streets below
were empty of all signs of life.  Slow footsteps make his head turn. 
Emotionless eyes meet him as one of the servants' approaches, unseen to all
but his eyes.  A good thing, he muses, given their vast deformities.  Oh,
but he had a use for them, and so would live with it.  {W'Master,'{X the
servant says, his voice ghostly in the air above the Tower.  {W'There is
{Wsomeone looking for you, down below.'{X

The master of the Tower lets loose a soft chuckle, eyes betraying nothing, {D'And what do they wish to
see me for?  '{X {W'Master'{X The servant whispers, {W'It could -see- us. 
'{X The Master's eyes narrow at the piece of news.  It must be a formidable
creature indeed, if it could see his servants.  Half the creatures he
summoned from the many planes, among the most formidable in the multiverse,
could not see his servants, such was his ability.  Yet this person could. 
{D'Well, it might be interesting, at least.  {X 
 
As the Master follows the servant from the top of the Tower, he glances out one last time, making it inside right before the storm breaks. It met his predictions. Thunder echoed, and lightning rained down on the outside. The grove, however, was unharmed. Finally, the man reaches the bottom of the spiral staircase. He walks into the audience chamber, to find what appears to be a young woman setting on the couch.
 
As he enters, the woman looks up from admiring her nails, {d'Oh, Towermaster, I'm so delighted you could make it.'{X She says, her voice soft and musical, almost perfect. With a nod dismissing his servant, who the lady watches leave, the man summons a chair, and sits opposite the girl, {D'So, m'Lady, what brings you to my Tower?'{X
 
A soft tinkling laugh echoes in his ears, {d'Well, Towermaster,'{X she begins, shaking her long black hair out of her eyes, {d'I have something that might interest you.'{X The man nods, motioning her to tell out her story.
 
{d'I was wandering alone, a dangerous thing to do in these days, even in Solamnia. You'd think the Knights would take better care to keep brigands off the road, but no, they don't. I could do a better job myself. Anyway, I was wandering alone, and on the road I met an old crippled man. He wasn't just any old crippled man, but an OLD old crippled man, mind you! But, anyway, he was heading in my direction, it doesn't matter where, and I figured I would walk with him. As we were doing so, he pulled out an ol
{ddeck of cards. I thought they were normal playing cards but, no, I was wrong. Nor were they your typical tarot cards. No, they were CARDS. There were three different suits, I guess you could call them. They were really suits, more like groupings, but suits still fits. Well, there was one for neutrality, good, and evil. There were twelve cards for each suit. Every card had a picture, as well as a name. Each suit had the same names: The King, The Queen, The Magi, The Warrior, Spiritwalker, Claw, Eye of th
God, Hunter, The Returned, The Cup, The Bearer, and the Chosen. And, the thing is, I RECOGNIZED THE PICTURE OF EACH CARD. They were all formidable people, and, upon thinking, I understood why they occupied that position.'{X
 
The woman pauses to take a deep breath, {d'But, the old man said there was something happening. A war was being fought between them, for power. And he pulled out a thirty seventh card, empty, except for the name, The Taken. It was this card that seemed to be the pinnacle each was striving for. But, you, TowermasterYou were in that deck. A perfect drawing of you!'{X
 
The Master listens, curiosity piqued, as the woman finished, {d'And you were poised to destroy the others, and become the Taken!'
{X
 
OOC: Ok, sorry it's not formatted, but it ruins all sense of organiziation if I did format it. And I'm sorry for some cut off words (the and old at the end), it's because that's where my line stopped, and I didn't want to format it and deal with it running together and whatnot. And, no, this won't give Rayo any extra powers, merely explain his descent into irreversable darkness, and, perhaps, insanity.

Text
((Just what happens when someone opens it and reads it? Silvaria has become
Ordermaster Darkahn Kiralv's ambassador to the Foresters. She is within Wayreth,
having a brief meeting with him, when he is summoned away from the Black
Tower by a keening wail from elsewhere in Wayreth. As he leaves his chambers to
investigate, the following takes place.))

Silvaria sits on the hearth for a while before her mood changes to that of
intense curiosity. She stands and begins to wander around the shelves of the
room, peering at the spines of the aged books. The thought nags the back of
her mind, but she doesn't consider the journal until she comes to stand
before the desk. She stands over it, staring at it, something holding her back
while something else tells her to open it.

Silvaria peers over her shoulder and glances around the room, not sure why
she feels like someone could be watching when she had heard him lock the door
behind him. Once she is confident no one is there, however, she turns her full
attention to the journal and, after hesitating only to take a deep breath,
takes the cover in one hand and opens to the first page.

As she does so, she notices immediately that the stains are not black, but red.
In fact, the putrid stench of blood remains; indeed, the writing looks to
remain wet to the touch, as fresh as it had been when it was first put on
the page. Without warning, she hears what sounds like a chorus of whispers;
what starts as one voice becomes dozens, and dozens become hundreds, and
hundreds become thousands. Their chorus becomes louder, almost deafeningly so.

Silvaria feels the urge to cover her ears to the strange noise, but she can't
take her eyes away from the spidery handwriting etched in bloodred. She
moves her hand toward it, and lays a finger lightly upon the page. The
melody ceases.

The blood is bone-chillingly cold, forcing her to jerk back from the touch.
As she does, she can't help but take a look at her finger, to check it
for damage. The blood runs from her finger, down to her palm, to her arm,
and it continues to spread. In fact, it seems to consume her arm, moving
across her entire body like a liquid plague, slowly creeping up her neck.

A gasp, then a strangled cry escapes Silvaria, cut off by the cold bloodcurse.
She shivers uncontrollably, as the curse makes its way through her body,
falls to her knees and curls up while she still has feeling in her back
and stomach. Soon, though, she can barely feel her chest enough to draw
breath. She can barely even think, to berate herself for her curiosity.

The blood finally finds its way to her face, consuming the entirety of
her head and even delving into her mouth -- an unnatural, internal cold
overtaking her. The blood begins to glow and, before long, like a torrent or
a mealstrom, the book consumes the blood once more; drawing her with it.


((Want to read more? Posts are updated on my tumblr more often than on this thread,
but I will do my best to keep the thread updated equally, as well as posting the last

The night was dark and the wind cold as Feramere stepped out his door. 
He knew not why but he had been awakened suddenly in the night to a haunting
sound playing in the wind,or maybe just in his mind.  Whatever the reasoning
was he felt inexplicably drawn to it.  It carried him out his door and into
the night almost like a child being led by the hand.  What was this sound? 
What was its purpose?  Why did it sound so sad?  Even as he asked himself
these questions he found himself tearing through the brush and suddenly
climbing the face of a mountain.  The sound growing more pronounced and
sadder the higher he climbed.  He barely even noticed his fatigue as he
pulled himself onto a narrow ledge high on the mountain.  Neither did he
care.  He had to know the source of this eerie melody.  Suddenly he finds
himself stopped at the entrance of a dark cave as if his feet begged him to
not go on.  But he must, and he does.  Blindly he feels his way through the
dark passages led only by the sound.  That sound.....  What was it?  Then
upon rounding a corner there was a dim light illuminating a man sitting
alone with a harp in his lap,his face remaining in darkness.  As Feramere
stepped forward he couldn't help but be overcome with an immediate sense of
danger.  And just as his better judgment was telling him to flee the strange
man spoke, "Do you know what and where you are?"  The man said in a raspy
voice.  Feramere started to shake, finding himself unable to speak.  The
light flared and the man's face was revealed.  Horrible,grotesque.  The
Undead.  Panic.  "You are just a fly" he stands."  And this is the spiders
lair."  ...  The light goes out.

Text
The sky lightens to the east as daylight begins its eternal
chase of the night. It is still too early for the morning
birds to sing their songs, and much of the Forester Temple
remains asleep in their hammocks and on their nests of soft
foliage.
 
There remains at least one awake -- though she does not lie
within the Temple proper. Beyond the familiar haven of Golametti's
hut grows a large tree with thick, low-lying branches. A pale
figure can be seen nestled betwixt two limbs, her odd eyes gazing
out over the rest of the Temple. Pale, chromatic light glimmers along
the pathways, emitted by small fungi that glow under the light of
the Moons. Silvaria watches them twinkle and wink out as daylight
creeps over the forest.
 
Her thoughts are far from the small mushrooms, though a part of her
does enjoy the sight of them. Sleep has eluded her this night because
her mind ruthlessly plays over haunting memories and worriesome
thoughts.
 
As new leader of the Foresters -- the third in the time of a
year -- she has struggled to find her place among these peaceful
people. Where they had been content to call her one of their own
before, something feels amiss now. Regardless of attempts to bring
herself closer to them, there is distrust -- she can feel it.
 
Her application to take the position of Keeper had been stiff,
and when she looks back upon it, she feels doubt and uncertainty.
She wonders to herself, now, if writing an application had been
the right way to approach the position. There is muted talk of
the leader before her, whose word she had hastily dismissed. She
hadn't known Anavrin, and she does not know his daughter, to whom
he had left leadership in his resignation. Regardless, to so readily
brush aside his wishes while he lay upon his deathbed... The guilt
weighs upon her, and she hasn't the slightest idea of what to do
about it.
 
Of course, the circumstances surrounding her disappearance -- and
the increased activity of mages in the Temple following her
return from Kalaman -- only fuel the distress. The memory of
Theriss razing the nearby forests is fresh for many of the
inhabitants, and they speak of the damage and casualties as though
it had happened just the day before. She wonders if they think
she will welcome those who wish them harm, when that is the
farthest from her intention.
 
Still, she was gone for weeks at a time, during a time when she
had promised that she would be dedicated to helping them.
And, each time, it had followed the appearance of a Conclavian mage
within the Temple. Not to mention the "medicine" that she had
been so unwittingly welcome to speak of, before...
 
'{CI ought to have taken this slower,{X' she murmurs to herself
as the birds in the trees around her begin to wake and sing,
rousing the Foresters below in turn. '{CI should have considered
these things closer, done more research, spent more time, been
more respectful...{X' Silvaria sighs deeply. Her eyelids are
heavy with exhaustion, but she moves methodically to stretch
her cramped muscles.
 
A careful movement slips her safely from the branches of the tree
to the ground, and once there, she takes a long drink from her
runed elixir. A soft sound makes her look up suddenly, and as she
sees Golametti standing there, she drops the elixir to her side
and presses it closely to her leg, out of sight.

'{CGood morning, Golametti,{X' Silvaria says quietly.

Starting in Palanthas, His stiry began. He watched as the Guards and Knights marched around palanthas. In his mind he dreamed of becoming a knight, And his wish would be granted.. He trained hard. Daily learning he way of the Sword and nobillity and honor. He learned self dicipline and excelled amongst the other squires.
 
He quickly rose to the head of his group. His Lord Knight proud. He finished his training with excellence and honors. He had high recomendation to try for he Knights of Solamnia. He devited himself to the Platinum Dragon E'li. But years had passed. Not one note. Not one knight came to seek him. He defended the weak. Upheld noble law. And with nothing returned to hime he felt abandoned.
 
He soon trained for his own skill. He desired deeply to be something... Be somebody. His lust for just beeong remembered overtook his patience. He soon lost hope of joining the KoS. He then promised that no matter the cost His name would live forever. Never be forgotten. He soon found a dark place to call home under the blessings of Satyr. He traveled to PoC slaying the innocent whom he had once protected. He desired power more now. He soon took the city if PoC. Now an undead territory.
 
He then traveled into the heart of death.. Deep in the dargarrd mountains. There he found his sanctuary. He trains soldiers of the Undead. Leading them throuh the caves in the mountains. Flourishing the undeads streingth. Dontavius did this all in a matter of 5 years.
 
But his name never beeing forgotton is a long way off. He currently still trains the soldiers of the ubdead. Leading them to streignth and power. Te knight is soon to be the greatest WarLord in Ansalon.

And a goup of undead soldiers gallops into the small rural countryside of kalaman.
 
Heading the party Dontavius yells "BOW TO THE LEGION! SATYR THESE SOULS ARE YOURS!" His soldier raid houses. Burning looting and pillidging. His commands are heardbthrough the streets. Citizens scurry to ty and find safe haven. Children huddle togeth crying and sobbing. The streets begin to fill with blood. Towns guards are slain their efforts to little avail.
 
The raiding party continues. Burning shops homes and farms. Live stock is killed and left right werebthey lie.Same for bodies of the citizens. A group of children huddle at the back of an alleyway. Dontavius mitions for three of his men to check and clear the allley way. The three men drag four chikdren out into the street. One makes a run for it. An arrow finds the small of his back before he gets too far. The cackling of the archer who ended his life rings out.
 
One of the soldiers looks to Dontavius "What should we do wih these three M'Lord?" An evik grin upon his face as he looks down to the children. "Makes them slaves for our armies. I want them smithing and forging right away!" He smirks. "Then when you believe theyv'e served their time..." He pauses still smirking devilishly. "Kill them and send their souls to Satyr." Dontavius looks around himself. The night skye is lit by the fires of the burning town.
 
Dontavius turns to leave with two of his most loyal soldiers, Before doing so he irders the soldiers "Gather up the citizens that are left. Kill the weak and the resistant! The rest are to be slaves. The WarLord then briskly gallops away one Lieutenant and Captain at his side. As they are riding away he speaks clearly to them both "All the living shall feel this very exhistance. Those who do not serve The Lord of Death shall become tortured souls. Loot and burn the temples. Slay everything that walks!"
 
The WarLord heads back into the Dargarrd mountains. His next invasion already upon his mind. He thinks to himself "Power is mine!"

Groggily he shook his straw-like hair free of dirt and slapped his own face to regain sight.
"How long have I been out this time...?" he muttered to himself and all whom may be listening.Ages,months,days? He didn't know, all he knew was he needed to get to
the Undead headquarters and see if the Solamnoics had managed to burn it down yet.
 
He crept slowely down the dark familiar passages and the same timeless skeletol guard faces greeted him, along with several new corpses and shambling undead new to undeath.
"Hmmmm" he thought and dredged on hazily toward his once office door.Slamming the door open with a powerful kick,his eyes bulged at the sight they beheld.
His things...scattered about and rearranged, and thrown messily into a pile in the corner was a stack of notes and letters, all new.
"Paperwork.." he laughed to himself,"I awaken to paperwork?Surely you jest Great Lord....a bard has other songs to tell than that of how well he reads through papers" and with

Suddenly a single candle in the corner of the room came to light on its own, impossible Arlanthis knew, purhaps a sign.
He looked down at the edge of the circle of illumination let out by the candle and saw his pale hand resting
on an important looking peice of parchment.On the outside was the seal of the Knights of Tahkisis, fresh.

"Where are you my brother in eternity?
He stood for a long moment reflecting on the past.The crushing of his enemies, watching them flee before him, and hearing the lamentation of the women..
Sinjin there through it all."I must find you.But first...."
 
He pulled on the nearest skeletol guard with his mind and the guard answered. Creeking the door open slowely, red eyes showing through the darkness, the skeleton crept into the room.
"Yes master...." it drooled out. Arlanthis would just ask the legoins  purpose from this lowely servant but he knew it may not tell the truth. It could have been corrupted by this new power.
So instead he lashed out with his hand and placed it on the skeletons cold,boney forehead.Srawing in images of the past seen through its eyes. Its memories, its actions, the commands spoken to it.
 
With a grin Arlanthis knew most things it had , just as the skeleton broke into individual bones and stumbled to the ground in a heap.
"Hmmmmmm" he thought to himself.
"Interesting, to take Palanthas.....a fools errand I would have once said.I myself know well that cities defenses.But purhaps this time will be different.....purhaps this time the Knights will not be there to resist."

Brushing the hair from his eyes, Tharm looks out from the wall of

evidence pointing to arson, but this had been planned for. Tharm had 
planned for several events that could come to happen during the 
siege that had befallen Palanthas, a fire to the Vingaard  forest being 
one of them. A wing of soldiers had been  stationed in the forest, 
hidden at several locations through its entirety . And when the fires 
broke out and spread, they leapt into action, digging fire breaks, to 
contain the fire, and sending word to the city of any happenings.
 
It took only a few hours to contain the fire, and it was already burning 
itself out well before day light. He looks down to a missive he hand 
clutched in one of his mailed hands. The missive was from one of the

undead moving through the forest, the size estimated at just under 
two wings.  He Shook his head, the legion he thought to himself. This 
was becoming more and more troublesome, the city had reports of

With a long, tired sigh, Silvaria puts down the parchment upon which the missive
is scribed. She rubs at her head, leaning back in the hammock she had perched
upon. It swings gently, causing her foot to brush against a nearby wooden chair.
On the back of this chair, a barn owl slumbers peacefully, its white feathers
standing out starkly against the dim interior of the hut. She watches the owl
absently, her mind drifting...
 
With a soft shuffling, the elderly druid, Golametti, moves towards her from the
back of the hut. Her attention is pulled to him, and she can see he has a mug of
steaming tea in his hands, though he is staring at the owl.
 
'{yI have known many creatures to visit us here,{X' he states quietly. '{yBut none to be
quite so friendly as that owl.{X'
 
Silvaria smiles, and as he offers her the mug, she gladly takes it. She peers into the
tea, watching the tealeaves swirl about in the water. '{CWe are being summoned to
war,{x' she says, barely loud enough for him to hear.
 
'{yWhose war?{x' Golametti responds gruffly. '{yOur war?{x'
 
Silvaria shakes her head slowly. '{CNo. The Undead assault the lands of Solamnia to
the north. They have tried to claim Kalaman. They now attempt to take over
Palanthas. Those guarding the city wish for us to spare marksmen...{X' She laughs.
'{CAs though we had marksmen to spare...{X'
 
Golametti makes a soft gesture with his hand, and a chair forms slowly from the
ground near Silvaria's feet, where they dangle from the edge of the hammock. '{yI
think you and I may share sentiment on this issue...{x' he states, taking his time as
he sits, and breathing a sigh of relief once he does.
 
Silvaria utters a frustrated sigh. '{CPerhaps... if there were volunteers...{X' she
murmurs, trailing off. '{CI am no general,{X' she continues at length. '{CAnd I will certainly
not force any of these people from their homes to defend forests hundreds of leagues
away from here...{x' She closes her eyes. '{CI regret each death that should happen in
Vingaard. Each creature that is killed senselessly and each inch of forest that is
uprooted and burned... But our place is here. Once the Undead have been driven back
to their hole in the mountain... Perhaps then, we can offer our help with the restoration
of Vingaard...{X'
 
Amiable silence stretches between them following her statement, and Silvaria
finally takes a long drink from the mug of tea in her hands. She opens her eyes
and tilts her head towards Golametti, perking her ears. '{CPeppermint, lemongrass,
chamomile... cinnamon... and...?{x'
 
The druid chuckles. '{yGinger, my girl. It will soothe your nerves, maybe even
allow for you to get some rest.{X'
 
'{CRest...{x' Silvaria echoes with a laugh. '{CI can't rest... I've letters to write...
A meeting to plan... People to find... I need new armor, too. And the construction
I've begun? When will I have time to continue that?{X' The owl wakes suddenly,
emitting a shrill chirrup and opening its icy blue eyes. Its gaze finds Silvaria,
and she gazes back at it, but makes no other movement.
 
Golametti watches the owl as well, then moves slowly to his feet. The chair
beneath him melts back into the ground, and he lays his hand gently upon
Silvaria's ankle. '{yYou really ought to rest... lest you be vulnerable when you are
needed most.{X'
 
Silvaria's surprised gaze finds Golametti, though he seems to avoid looking at her.
He turns away and shuffles into the back of the hut.
 
The owl makes another, softer sound, and ruffles its feathers. Silvaria drains the
mug of the rest of her tea and sighs, looking up at the owl and grinning softly. '{CI
certainly hope you got some of this "rest" he speaks of,{x' she murmurs. She allows
her head to fall back against the hammock and, for the first time in days, finally
drifts off into a restless slumber.

A lone shaft of moonlight beamed through the one small window of the shack and onto an ornate wooden table with a large map covering it.
Arlanthis and Dontavius stood around the table, in the midst of a clandestine meeting, the shaft of light illuminating the picture of Krynn on the map.
In the corner of the otherwise empty shack, a small end table and chair, candle burned down almost to the end of the wick.
"Good good." Arlanthis said quietly while hovering over the map. "I knew our Lords will to burn the forest would be fruitfull.
Those living in them have fled into the city of Palanthas, putting even more strain on its food demands."
he tapped a cold hard finger on the table, directly over the symbol for Kalaman.
"They will be hard pressed for supplies once we pinch the south." said Arlanthis with a sly grin on his face.
 
Taking an ivory bone finger no bigger than half the size of a real one out of a cloth bag on the corner of the table,
he places it just south of Palanthas, along with two others.
Dontavius merely stood respectfully and watched as his Elder showed him the finer points of harassing your enemy, and his.
"As the city starves its citizens will feel the bitter sting of something worse than our steel, the deep cut of hunger.On the body and the mind."
said Arlanthis as he worked his way around the table."As they grow desperate so will thier defenders for solution.Chemosh will thrive in this environment and victory is slowely but surely ours.

They do not want to play a waiting game with the eternal.We will wait to see which way they grasp for breath and our time to strike with present itself.
"Arlanthis reaches over and takes two more ivory fingers out the bag and places them in the fields of Dargaard.
A flash of lightning lights the room up suddenly and reveals two skeletol minions by the door and two corpses of the villagers at thier feet, skinless.
The skins hanging bloodily in the skeleton's hands.Arlanthis nods toward them and they
pull the perfectly peeled off skin over thier own faces, the likeless sickeningly off.
With a few words under his breath the skin around the eyes and mouth seemlessly sealed to the bone.
All over the skin seamed out and looked more natural, but still off.
None but a trained eye would notice.Arlanthis and Dontavius grinned at the sight.
With a snap they exited the shack and out into the village, where surely they were to repeat the process until every villager
had been replaced with an undead wearing thier skin."Tell the legion they may begun tossing the corpses of the villegers and 
others over the western walls of Palanthas, the sight and stench will help further Chemosh' dark justice.
Dontavius nodded with a grin then left swiftly, leaving Arlanthis to plot over the maps once more.
"Yes, plans in motion." he rubbed his hand over the symbol of Palanthas on the map.
Yes, prize of prizes.
A darkness swelled in his eyes and over the village as screams peirced through the night.

It is a quiet night, a ominous red glow coming from the forests near Palanthas fill the sky.
Near the prow of a ship of an old minotaur sighs:
- This wont be good for business, the forests are burning.
The gray furred minotaur browses his stuff, when he cuts himself on a sharp knife:
- Ah by Reorxs beard, this starts good, why on Krynn would this leather tanning knife would be outside its sheathe?
- Baa, nevermind. - he crosses his large hands through a scar of battle that he won long time ago. - It is time for us to pick our hammers and make something useful for this land.
- Captain It seems we can land near that cove.
The dwarven captain approaches Ubaldo, grabs his spyglass and nods:
- Aye old master, that will do, I was hoping a warmer welcome.
- Warmer reception lad? The damn forest is on fire, and you wanted a warmer welcome. - the minotaur begins to laugh.
The captain smiles: - Ill choice of words master Ubaldo.
- Aye, but do not worry, ready your men, tell them to bring coal, steel and will to work, tonight and the next days the forges of Palanthas will once again burn with life.
As the group of smiths set foot on the port a tall and strong elf riding bareback on a white horse:
- Halt! who goes there.
The old blacksmith holds his reaver:
-  I might be hold, but I bet that this reaver will cleave through rider and mount with a single slash.
- Do you know who we are you beardless elf? - Shouts the ships captain.
The young elf smiles, he notes the tools and crates filled with coal and answers with a taunt.
- Go back from where you came fellow smiths, this land is under siege, we dont need more mouths to feed. - He scorns while patting his worn out axe. - All we need is valiant warriors and...
- ... And new weapons. - The old smith interrupts. - We are good at making new weapons. - The minotaur throws a small francisca towards a thick tree trunk cleaving almost through it.
The elfs jaw falls in astonishment.
- What Is your name lad? - The old minotaur asks.
- My name is Bayum, elven warrior from kagonesti and soon to be Templar. - He speaks with a salute.
The old smith smiles getting a battle axe from a cloth: 
- Here you go lad, I made it myself, I hope you give good use to it.
The young kagonesti accepts the gift from the minotaurs hands and remarks:
- I have never held such a masterpiece, the edge is so sharp I bet it would be able to cut through thick armor, you werent joking when you said that it would be able to cut through rider and mount, with a single slice.
The minotaur smiles patting the elf on the shoulder as he walks right by him towards the city.
- Master Smith, thank you for your gift. May I ask what Is your name?
The small stocky captain strikes his beard and answers the curious elf: - He is Ubaldo Xadim, the legendary axe forger, and do not think this is a favor, we are here to do business nothing more, and maybe grind a few bones along the way...

The night has fallen. Along the river band near Solanthus a young Dargonesti templar appears in the nearby a settlement, following this Templar a small platoon of Solamnic knights follow the dargonesti girl. The lumberjacks that were assembling a few rafts and fixing a few merchant ships specially designed to carry equipment and food to the nearby high clerist's tower.
A young man approaches the lady Templar, bows and reports:
- Lady Eyleen, master Tharm has warned us that you were coming, we are only few man, Is it true that you are heading to the tower?
- Indeed I am, the gods are on our side, Habbakuk has provided us with a clear sky with warm waters and a cold evening, I sense that we are going to have a misty night.
- But madam we can't navigate with fog.
Eyleen smiles:
-That is why I asked for a few hippocampus to guide your ships along the meanders of the river, just tie the hippocampuses to the ships and they will pull the ships, they are used to hard labours.
-I have never seen such noble beasts. - Replies the man. - I trust your judgement lady Eyleen.
The silver moon rises in the sky, The white mages dispatched to aid Eyleen on her effort smile.
-This will be a memorable night.
-May Solinary guide us all Kenyae, you do your job we will do ours - Eyleen winks.
-We got this lady Eyleen, Solinari will shed his light upon us.
As it was foreseen by the dargonesti in the first watch the fog starts forming, the mages light some fires designed to thicken the fog.
Eyleen and his Templar and Solamnic guard ride north, to victory, let's have faith.
The ride is followed by the thick mist, but alas just a few miles short a few skeleton warriors guard the river margins.
The templar halts the troops and does what she does best, she holds her flute and starts playing it, a beautiful and enchanting melody fills the sky, the skeleton warriors start looking frail and suddenly they collapse.
-Well this has worked better than I expected, shall we gentleman?
The troops press on towards the citadel's gates.
-No one at the gates. Eyleen notes - Some consider this as holy grounds, let's hope this is true
It wasn't the courtyard was filled with skeletons and the walls filled with skeleton archers. A volley of black plumed arrows cross the sky with a terrible hiss.

The clash of steel on steel echoed through the air as the battle ensued. She rushed into the fray, dropping her shoulder into the sternum of a legion swordsman who opposed her, sending him skidding across his back. She brought her sword to meet his skull before he could recover from the blow.
-My lady press on, we will distract them.
-But you will die! - Eyleen answers.
-We will join our gods, we will die well and free.
Eyleen sighs and soldiers on towards the legendary dragontraps, only few men were left, most of them have seen only few springs, the Templar thinks - Blue lady, mother of all good, guide our hands and deliver this knight's souls to your side.
The dargonesti sings a song specially written to set fire to the young warriors hearts. - Let's go. She unsheathes her claymore, heirloom of his family. 
The fighting inside was less fierce, most of the legion soldiers were fighting in the courtyard
The time flows like thick honey; The battle is fierce but suddenly all fighting stops, she can hear the clacking sounds of the skeletal feet that were rushing behind her group.
After many wrong turns, some fighting and much wasted time she came upon the corridor and finally the room she needed. The room of the High Clerist, Leader of the order of the sword. The door was ornate, the images covering its oaken surface showed that of clerics leading men into battle, and saving the lives of men on the brink of demise
-This is it man, our last stand, we have no way out, this room will be our tomb, the High Clerist's study.
A great key given to Eyleen opens the door and the white warriors rush inside.
Rich tapestries hung on the walls and thick carpets on the floor. A bed that look thick and soft enough that she would sink and be lost in it. But she did not have time to admire the room:
"Search for the silver bell, make it sound and you will have a great surprise." This words said by Tharm just a few days ago rush to the Dargonesti's mind. - Dammit Tharm You could have 
been more specific. - She hurried over to the dresser and began to look through the affects of its previous owner, cloths were torn from the dressers, she threw all the objects on its surface aside, but she did not find what she was after. Letting out a sigh she lowered her head to think. - Common People are dying here, where are you? - As she stoped a faint ray of moonlight 
shining through the window reflected off of something small and metallic on the window sill, the reflection catching her eye. Walking over to it she shook her head in disbelief. - After all that searching, it was in plain sight.
The sun starts rising and some arcane chants echo in the mountain side, from the gates of the citadel hundreds of Undead warriors rush towards the boats, the battle is fierce, many men and undead are ripped apart.
who
l
-I have led you on a fool's errand, we will all die, how can this bell be a sign of salvation, sorry my dear friends. - The templar's knees fail and she releases the bell, as it touches the ground the most beautiful sound echoes in the room. - Such beautiful sound, this must be the sounds that can be heard on the heavens.
- My lady look, there in the sky!
Eyleen summons her remaining strength and looks through the window.
-Dragons, you twisted and great man, you could have told me!! - She cries with happiness: - We have won this battle, we have won.
Wings of silver dragons freeze the Undead warriors leaving all the Allies unharmed.
-I can rest now, I can rest now. - Eyleen drifts for a quiet slumber.

Those with injury's are pulled to the side for a cleric to look at.  As all this is going one of the leaders of the Aesthetics sits at her desk, looking over all the missives that have been sent from all parts of Krynn.  
'{bI am getting too old for this.{x' the back haired woman states, tossing the papers into the air as she stands up hurriedly.  '{b I retired from combat years ago..

Silvaria's hands shake as she finishes sealing the last of the missives
that will be sent away -- two score and half again. Her eyes focus on
the ground before her, and her whole body is rigid and tense. The
expression on her face is guarded, hard, and resigned -- until the
fluttering of many wings is heard.
 
The kagonesti girl looks up and blinks, her long ears perking. Dozens
of white messenger birds land around her, and at the rear of them --
almost as though it had herded the birds to Silvaria -- is the very
same blue-eyed barn owl. Silvaria emits an amused laugh, though
it fades as she begins tying off the pieces of worn parchment to the
birds' legs and sending them off. The owl utters a satisfied hoot,
having alighted upon a branch above, but proceeds to flutter down to
waddle about the ground next to her, as though overseeing the
process.
 
All but three birds had been sent away when the approach of a
person is heard. Both owl and kagonesti glance up, blinking at the
newcomer -- though Silvaria rises to her feet immediately, leaving
the owl hooting indignantly, before flying up to a branch overhead
to watch.
 
'{CAmalthea,{X' Silvaria greets with a surprised grin, her tone full of
pleasure. She begins to step forward.
 
The young human girl who stands before her does not return the grin,
and instead shifts uneasily before the kagonesti. '{m...Silvaria,{X'
Amalthea replies softly.
 
This stops the kagonesti in her tracks, and the grin fades. '{C...How
have you been?{X' Silvaria asks, trying to keep her tone light. '{CI've
noticed your absence... Did you hear? I am--{X'
 
'{mLeader,{X' Amalthea interrupts quickly, nodding and finally meeting
Silvaria's gaze. '{mYes, I had heard. For your first question... I am
well enough. Unharmed. I've come from the north.{X'
 
'{CFrom the north?{x' Silvaria asks, her eyes wide. '{C...Is that why
you've come back, then?{X' she asks bluntly.
 
Amalthea blinks, then shrugs, and her brown eyes find the ground again.
'{mOne of the reasons, I guess?{x' She sees the pieces of rolled parchment on
the ground and frowns. '{mWhat is...?{x' Silvaria follows her gaze, then
fetches one of them. She unties it, and offers it to Amalthea -- but
the human girl shakes her head and hands it back. '{mThere have been so
many letters... Quite a few have found their way to me. I cannot read
them.{X'
 
Silvaria blinks. '{C...Oh.{X' She takes the parchment and rerolls it,
though her eyes are on Amalthea. '{CIt... merely states that the
Foresters as a whole have refrained from making any kind of
decision about joining the fight against the Undead...{X' She steps closer
to the human girl, but Amalthea turns her head away. Silvaria seems
saddened by this, but continues anyway. '{CWhat have you seen,
Amalthea...?{X' However, she stops suddenly, closes her eyes and
shakes her head. '{CNo... Don't answer that. Come, I'll make some
tea. You've had a long journey. There will be time for us to speak
once you've relaxed...{x'
 
Amalthea gazes at the kagonesti for a few moments in silence, then
nods. '{mOkay. That sounds good.{X'
 
The pair of Foresters head towards Golametti's hut, followed closely
by the blue-eyed owl.

Learning of the loss if the tower, Dontavius gets merely agitated by the fact simply because it was a loss. He wonders what Arlanthis will say. How he was a failure. How he couldn't be what chemosh wanted. Dontavius smirks to himself for a moment.
 
He ponders something deeply. He turns and motions to his skeletal guard. The guard comes over and shrieks "{RYes M{x'{RLord{x?" Dontavius speaks sternly. "{DI want all the mages proficiant in the art if poison{x!" He barks to the guard. The guard hastily delivers the message.

Within the temple of Chemosh sits a Quoowahb alone in the dark he slowly rocks back and forth.  His mind is unbalanced all is quiet here other than his  mumbling.   All of a sudden the sound of combat rings   through out the temple.
In walks a Knight of Solamnia wielding a lance crackaling with electricity. The knight is covered in dust of the land and bones. The man's voice echoes and booms within these walls. "{CSo the rumors are true there is a priest here.{x"  The man steps forward. Zuberi can see the knight now he stands roughly six feet tall and broad shoulder.
He starts giggling as he stands up his seven feet slender body takes up a stance ready to defend himself. "{cFoolish knight do you not know who temple you have walked into. The is Lord Chemosh's temple. You have have slain his warriors and arches he's is displeased and I shall please him by taking and offering your soul to him.{x"

Zuberi grabs the flail hanging off his belt  in his other hand swinging it with all his unholy might the sound of bones breaking as the man hand shatters.  The knight drops his lance and quickly pulls a sword off his back in his other hand an lunges again.
 
Zuberi in a hysterical fit of laughter dodges and spin his voice is high pitch and crazed sounding "{cI shall reap your soul and bath in your blood. I'll make your skull a chamber pot and grind your bones into ash.{x" He swings the mace wildly as the knight dodge and try's to block the attack with his sword.

The man spit as he utters "{CI lived through worst things I shall not die this day I've killed Liches and plenty of warriors and priests you shall be no different{x". The man swings and catches Zuberi square in the jaw.
The swings hits so hard it pops it out of place leaving him unable to speak yet he giggles and laughs.  Zuberi simply pops it in to place as the knight trips him. He hits the floor hard an loses the mace. The man swings for a killing blow. Yet misses as Zuberi dodges by rolling away he quickly gets back up and calls forth a deamon. The deamon slashes at the knights back. The man turns an cleaves the deamons head off.

The shadows of the Daargard Mountains lie deep, as the sun starts to set.
They slowly start to coalesce, an imperceptible change to all but the most
acute of viewers.  As they do, they take the form of a man.  As shadows
reach the full form, they seem to drip off the man, like water.  Making
certain nobody is around, Rayo Hereus, Archmage of the Wizard's Conclave,
slowly casts an invisibility and silence spell, having the very shadows
themselves mask his movements.  He slowly walks towards the "hidden" cave. 

{d'These Undead,'{X he thinks, {d'Must truly be stupid if they think they've
hidden this thing well.  '{X The thought is almost enough to make him laugh,
but he keeps from doing so.  As he nears the cave, he sends out his magic,
searching for both life and unlife in the vicinity.  He finds various
guardians left behind to defend the cave, but they are all minions.  He
shakes his head with a sigh - this would be easier than he first thought.

The first rays of sunlight pierced through the lone window on the shack Arlanthis had claimed as his personal headquarters.
Arlanthis, General of the Eternal Legion and beloved of Chemosh, squatted motionless by a long spent fire.A single tendril of smoke rose from the cold logs.
Evidence of a single ember spending its last moments in this life, somehow able to survive all night surrounded by cold.
He had sat there all night after Dontavius left to carry out his orders just starring at it, puzzled.
Voices had been whispering in the back of hsi head ever since he crawled from the dirt and resumed his forsaken work in this world.
 
Not the usual echoes of Chemosh' command, no, those had been dormant a long while now, only his own ambitions led him now.
So long since he had tasted such small but large freedom, ones own thoughts, but now he dined on them ravenously.
Giving order after order of his own, all the while the new voice whispering something he couldnt comprehend on his mind.
 
Not just that though. Recently he had begun to hum the tune of a song he had once used to sing often in his young tavern patrolling life.
But now the words escaped him, another of his treasures undeath stole from him.
Ever since his embrace of this new freedom however he has begun to remember the tune.....
* bum bum bum....bum bum bum...bummmmmm..bum* slowely swirling invading his thoughts.
 
Last night after Dontavius left it had begun to take control of him, he had to remember this song.
So he sat....all through the night starring at the fire trying to remember.
 
Just now as he stared at this dying ember a line of the song returned to him....
"I saw a fire, burning bright, a smoke amidst the embers." came the words to his mind.

He knew not why but he found himself rising and exiting the shack with an unnatural swiftness, not even a glance down at the table he moved around in the
middle of the room covered in his maps and plans.Just grabbed his small silver harp out his bag of instruments and was on his way.
Out the door and into the ever fading twilight, he moved past countless shambling husk with the name of
"villager".What was once mothers, fathers, daughters, sons....now just shadows of life.He moved past them all without a glance.
Straight to his horse and down the road he went, pulled by the melody and the desire to know the song.
 
He road past mountain peaks, through dry plains, and through low forests.But not alone, he had the company of  untold villagers and citizens of the land
now all turned to the undead.The animals and birds....the only life...plants.
The animals and birds long gone or eaten, no song of birds hung in the air..only the one in his head.
He found himself riding through the High Clerists Tower, also greeted by the twisted faces of undeath.
"Had the world been completely turned to Chemosh?" he found himself wondering, but he knew the answer was no,
atleast not yet....
 
He exited the northern end of the Tower and stopped, another line of the song now returned to his mine.
"Through hallowed halls, I walk alone.." the song went, slight satisfaction came to him as he noticed ihs actions to be helping.
He moved to grin with glee and found the undead flesh around hsi mouth noncompliant with grins currently, and smiles with them.
He just curled his nose and turned his head to the left, and the voices struck again...along with the melody.

Arlanthis didn't know why but he thought he could almost understand the voices, and it drew him toward the Vingaard forest.
Kicking his undead horse harder and harder, faster and faster, he was able to push it much further than a horse of living flesh.
This horse would not die from exhaustion but from just blowing out the muscles that held it together.
He didnt care, he pushed more and more, wind blowing his strawlike undead hair, much of it simply coming unrooted
and flying off like certain spiderlings do on strands of silk in the spring.
His need to remember this song must be sated, he knew nothing else.
 
He rounded a particularly sharp bend just before the forest and it happened. He heard a loud
*SNAP* as the horses legs gave way and the ankles went sideways.The cursed creature nays it's foul nay and goes down face first into the earth and grass.
Arlanthis merely floating out of the saddle in the first spin of the first frontflip the horse did.
It came to a stop a short ways away from the now standing Arlanthis in a heap of broken bone and flesh.
The force that animated the tissue having departed.
Arlanthis looked toward the smoldering forest and barely hesitated towalk toward it, harp in hand..

Arlanthis found himself now knee deep wading through burnt undergrowth and dredged tree roots, the forest having been had its way with by skeletol
minions and undead,like a barmaid on the battlefield by an enraged barbarian.
Few creatures skittered here and there, promising signs that even in so much death...life stil found its way.
But Arlanthis cared not for that, his mindset solid and set on recalling the song, now getting closer and closer to said goal.
 
He came into a wide clearing in the forest and saw a wide swath of trees and grass burnt to ashes before him to reveal the western
walls of Palanthas.The City of Cities.
He should know, for he once proudly protected those walls, and was willing to give all for them.
Now his forces laid seige to it, his once beloved citizens and friends now dying the slow death of starvation and fear.
 
As he thought that thought many others suddenly returned to him in a flash.
His whole life was laid bare before his eyes.Him, as a young lad training in the arena of Palanthas.
Raiding her sewers for rats and other means to gain experience in the art of song and sword.
His father always telling him it a fools errand, a proper man took a more stricker way of combat.
But Arlanthis preferred to be charismatic and versatile.The rift between father and son ultimately pushing him to
leave his family and take a job with the Artisans.Traveling blacksmiths and merchant's.
He would never see his father again.
 
He learned much though in the ways of the world traveling with the smiths and Delacom the greatest of them all.
He saw visions of nights at campfires singing, exotic taverns and cities he thought he would never see.
Bar fights and barmaids.....oh were there barmaids....and glorious drunken singing bout after another...

The visions flashed to days as a Templar, nights of worship, and simple service.
To days and nights of a crusader, zealous and dangerous, quick to seek out evil and destroy it were it hid.
That was usualy dark mountains and caves....away from barmaids.
Then the visions flashed to saving Solanthus, Inglor, the god Morgion, epic conquest of dragons and men,
to days of thankless duty as a knight in shining armor.His loyalty to law and justice unwavering.
And back to barmaids...to none barmaids. To loves won and lost, to loves that could of been but werent.
To his own death, and subsequent ressurection as undead, life eternal, eternity with no life.
 
As he pondered on misfortune after misfortune since...of sadness and sorrow. of longing and want..
and wanting to cry but having no tears...
Then..just as he thought he may actualy get emotional...the song.
 
It came to him in its entirety, a sng he once sung long ago in Myrtal's.
A popular song sung by many a bard from ages past and ages since titled, "Souls and Shadows passing" by the bard Aleina.
The song came to him and with it the rhythm in full as well. his hand lifted the silver harp he hardly remembered he had and began strumming on instinct.
His dry mouth opened and his lips cracked, with a dry voice he sang,
'I fell asleep in the darkest night And dreamt of stars, long remembered.'
'I saw a fire, burning bright, A smoke amidst the embers.'
For though my road has carried me through Days of joy and care,'
My weary steps have lead me to The steps of dark despair.'
Through hallowed halls, I walk alone, Fearing my next step to'
tread, Fear that it will lead me to my own Anguish, I am filled'
'with dread.'
The mountains no longer call to me, The forest's song is gone.'
'My ears are deaf to hope's melody, And Death, sweet Death.'
Death, my own, my one.'
 
 
The song ended on a somber note and with sudden clarity Arlanthis lowered his harp and realised the mountains did call to him.
The forests's song wasn't gone.
And his ears.....his ears were not deaf to hope's melody.
He dropped to his knees and prayed.

As he sat in the shack were all his orders were plotted before he carried them out, Dontavius wonders to himself why he is still deemed unworthy. He growls and swipes his hand across the map table. Knocking everything off but the single map of krynn. He glares icily at the map. He turns to his zombie servant. "{DSend word to the mountains{x! {DI want all the legions minions to prepare{x." The zombie groans "{yAye{x... {yMaster{x."
 
Riding along a path near the shack, Dontavius observes the area. Plotting. He grins evily at the thoughts that cross his mind. But the other part of him fights himself wondering what it will take. What does he have to do? He snorts and orders his steed the opposite direction. He heads for the shack once more. Upon arrival he chuckles to himself.
 
He enters the shack, Picking up the strewn objects from his fit of rage placing everything back accordingly. He grinds whats left of his brain for a long moment. He then growls "{DDamnit{x!" He sits down and reads over left behind scrolls. Researching the efforts before him that failed.
 
He knows he must come up with something far more grand. Something sure to work. He places the readings down and rubs his eyeballs with his bone fingers in agitation. He looks up only to see a single ray of moonlight illuminating his shack of a room.

Arlanthis now found himself back at his headquarters in the town of Ash staring down at his plans and works.
The night had been long out in the forest praying, as every night had been since his resurrection under Chemosh.
Dontavius the new Servant stood not far away, going off about his recent victory, but it fell on deaf ears.
 
Arlanthis was lost in his own thoughts.The night before...the song...so much had changed inside him.
He could barely see Dontavius waving his hands and going on through his peripherals, his focus burned on the map and his mind.
 
Suddenly Arlanthis felt a stir inside, and the vice returned."{gYou can have it all back{ ." it whispered.
Arlanthis found it more and more difficult to ignore his permanent state of torture under Chemosh.
Ostracized from love and warm, from life itself.His undead minions knew nothing but obey his command, and power had never been Arlanthis' goal.
 
Arlanthis straightened and folded his arms behind his back then walked silently toward the cold hearth in the wall.
"How long have you served Chemosh Dontavius?" he said with back turned toward the man.
The man cocked his head in confusion but answered as asked, "Six years sir."
Arlanthis found it hard to hold back a chuckle, he let a small one slip.
What a small sliver of time he thought....
How many years had he himself served? How many campaigns in the dark lords name had he undertaken against the living?
He could barely even recall, he could barely even remember many of the names he knew from his youth and service in the Templars.
Just thier twisted faces of agony in death....

Arlanthis found himself wondering.....How did he even know when he was in control of himself? Or when the Lord Chemosh was in control.
He Figured rarely was it the former, and shuddered.
 
Suddenly the voice returned "{gYou could have it all back.Love,friendship{ ...."
He did not even know when the voices started to come at him with this question, but by now he figured it was either Chemosh
testing his loyalty.Which, in that case, he was sure he had already failed.Or it was another God, who somehow saw something more in him still
and was willing to defy Chemosh to see it so.He was sure now it was this one, thus, it was no surprise to him when he felt the presence materialize behind him.
 
"Sir?! Whats going on?" he could hear Dontavius say behind him and the presence, but as before the words just drowned out.
The love and warmth he could feel radiating behind him all but left him speechless.His legs trembled.
"{gAre you ready{ ?" he could hear the voice whisper behind him and in his mind.
He could feel the outstretched hand behind him.No judgement.No requirments.Just understanding.
 
 
He felt the tear form in the corner of his cold, undead eye.
He had long since thought it impossible for those to flow other than when Chemosh tortured his body and mind.
But now he found himself letting it go unrestrained and not accompanied with pain.
 
His legs and arms spoke before his mind could, slowely he turned, and took hand.

Arlanthis stood before a goddess, one more beautiful than he could ever imagine.
He thought he had seen gods before, some grand, some horrific, this one took his breath away.
A loving glow of life radiated off of her and she took his hand in hers.The skin felt like a material not made in this world.
A silk no spider or catapillar could spin.A cloth no man could make.
He had only a moment of extasy before in a flash he was gone.Sucked into the earth in a torrent of vines and leaves.
Dontavius' voice calling out behind him, the voices of dolphins to a man.
 
Arlanthis emerged in a sheltered forest grove.He immediately embraced the warmth of light he felt over the cold, dank depression of Ash.
"In all my life..." he found the words spilling out his open and hanging mouth.
The goddess smiled and said, "{gNow, Chemosh has your soul so we shall have to make you a knew one.It will not be pleasant.Are you ready{ ?"
Arlanthis being no stranger to pain, purhaps even a master of it, nodded without hesitation.He had suffered long enough.
 
The god Chislev formed a green ball in her hands them plunged them through Arlanthis' bony chest.New flesh sprang from her fingertips
and coursed through and over his old undead flesh like worms in loose soil.
Intense pain radiated his body and Arlanthis cocked his head back to let out a primal yell.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH" echoed over the treetops and birds fluttered into the air.
The goddess knew her work and the flesh quickly settled.Arlanthis dropped to one knee in pain, exhausted.
"I...I" he had trouble forming words with hsi new voicebox.He ripped open what was left of his tatterred shirt and felt his chest all over.
The flesh felt like life, he felt alive.
"Is....is this real?" he asked hesitantly and foolishly.But the goddess was kind and forgiving beyond his
meaning of the words.She just looked down from her lofty position by her altar and smiled"{gDo try and take better care of yourself this time Arlanthis{ ."
This time he had to laugh.
 
"{gWhere would you like to go{ ?" she asked calmly.His head turned toward the direction of Palanthas,
"Home"

Sitting in his office deep within the Dargaard Mountains, Dontavius is angred by a visit paid to him by the Head of the conclave. "{DDamn them all Lord Satyr{x! {DThry mistaken me for some weak pathetic fool{x. {DThey shall know now{x... {DThey are wrong{x!" The General looks to his skeletal guard.
 
"{DPrepare the twenty thousand soldiers{x, {DAnd the Liches{x." The General growls! "{RAye M{x'{RLord{x!" The skeletal guard hurries through the halls, Straight to the war room. Tis early afternoon when the General stands before his massive undead Legion.
 
He raises his hand to silence the moaning and groaning. "{DChildren of the Lord of Death{x, {DTonight you shall begin your purpose{x!" The roar of undeath cries can be heard for miles around. "{DWe shall go now{x! {DWe shall spread the will of Satyr across these lands{x! {DBe merciless{x. {DKill everything that breathes{x... {DThat feels life{x!" His inspiring words raising more war cries from the skeletal soldiers.
 
"{DWe shall travel now{x, {DAround tye mountains and to the east gate{x!" The simutanious thud of skeletal feet shifting together is music to Dontavius's ears. He grins evily as the massive lines begin to move. It takes well into the night for the massive force to reach the halfway point of the journey. The Lich group of about seven thousand five hundred is led by Zuberi. Dontavius's loyal companion.
 
Along side Dontavius is Kyntari, An undead woman who has complete and without a doubt the Generals desire. He tells Zuberi "{DTell them to raise the fallen{x. {DLet not one weakness oresent itself{x!" Zuberi nods as he begins to preach to the Lich spawn. Dontavius looks in front of himself as at the head of the group are the {yUndead {Gogres{x. They move huge catapaults, In pairs slowly but surely, The massive army inches closer and closer. They reach the blue heights at mid day the next day. "{DLet no si
{Dgn of our presence be suspected{!" The General commands as he halts the massive army. Zuberi mianders from group to group. Preaching the will of Chemosh. The general awaits as the sun sets and the Black moon rises in the nights sky.
 
{xNightfall comes after what seems like an eternity. The massive force slims its rows moving through the mountain pass. The Ogres are first to pass. The catapaults are essential in this raid.
{xThe ogres succesfully pass through the terrain. The catapaults are through! Dontavius smirks, The rest of the massive force moves through the moubtains...
 
As a viper moves through sand. The General can now see the east side of the city. Its lit by the night city life. He orders the catapaults be stoped within launching range of the walls. Looking from side to side, Dontavius nods his head. The ogres begin loading straw bails into the catapaults. The magi step forth. Simutaniously they utter their {Rflaming{x incantations, Setting a blaze the straw bails.
 
Without hesitation Dontavius motions his hand in a forward motion. Skeletal archers move close as to send their arrows volleying over the walls. Once close enough, They await their order. Looking to the ogres, Dontavius growls "{DFIRE{x!" The ogres release the mechinisms sending balls of {Rflames{x over the walls. Screams can be heard. Crashing sounds erupt as the bails land on wooden structures.
 
"{DArchers VOLLEY{x!" The skeletal archers volley arrows high. The sounds of citizens and guards beeing struck with arrows can be heard. The general then orders the ogres to load boulders from near by. They are loaded. And one at a time sent into the east walls.
 
The sounds of crumbling bricks abd shattering boulders erupts. "{DWeaken their walls{x! {DShow not fear for you know none{x!" The solamnics posted at the east gate fire their arrows, Striking down archer after archer. Grinning evily the General orders "{DLet the lay{x!" The catapaults continue barraging boulders into the city and at the east wall. A giant crumbling sound can be heard as the east wall begins to give way.
 
The guards post is hit by a boukder sending some flying and others falling into the archers line of sight. One by one they trade off in kills. Growling with rage, The general yells "{DForward minions{x!" The skeletal soldiers begin to move forward. Some seven thousand five hundred of them. They move past the catapaults, Through the archers. They begin to to eliminate the little resistance offered by the knights that managed to survibe their fall. "{DMagi of Satyr{x! {DResurrect the dead{x!" The magi move 
forward, Ressurecting fallen kngihts, Guards, And skeletal forces. The ogres manning the catapaults continue the relentless assault upon the weak eastern wall. Suddenly a rumble is heard, Dust fills the air as the eastern wall gives way. Animated {ycoroses{x maul the weakened and the injured. {RFlaming {ystraw {xbails begin to rain through the gaping hole in the wall. Blazes begin to errupt. A blazed citizens run screaming. The skeletal archers continue to move forward. Followed by the skeletal knights.
 
The magi stay behind the knights. Necromancing the fallen. Dontvius watches on from atop his steed. Animated zombies continue to maul weak defensless citizens. Turning them shortly after they are bitten. The sight before the Generals eyes is marvelous to him. He looks to Zuberi "{DThe time of Satyr is now{x!"

Text
As soon as the undead Catapults approach the walls of palanthas na organzed frenzy brews within the city walls. Lady Eyleen interin chief appointed by the lord knight Tharm shouts her orders to the defenders of Palanthas:
- Men today is our day, the undead armies attack, but as you know hour defenses will hold as long as our minds and bodies are set to it.
Near the walls a ring of empty houses has been abandoned, on the city streets huge trebuchets and catapults are armed and fired at an astonishing rate, shooting a rain of rocks and fire over the undead spearhead.
With a gesture of Eyleens hand some white robes start casting warding spells on the Palanthas walls. The old runes cast long ago, some of them during the time of the first dragon wars.
The enemy rain of fire crashes against the outer wall, but as if they crash against a invisible shield great part of the walls remains undamaged:
- It seems the priests of the old Vinas Solamnus did a good work.  states Eyleen  Captain what are our losses.
- The losses are minimum my lady, only some unfortunate men fell under the first wave of enemy fire.
- Great, send word to the tower ballistas to aim at the enemy catapults, we must destroy them fist.
- Right away madam.  The commander barks some orders, and soon after that the ballistas located on top of the palanthian turrets fire at will causing huge damages to the undead artillery pieces.
After a few hours of attack and huge losses on the undead side the scattered troops start retreating.
Lady Eyleen posted on top of the outer wall looking to the battlefield:
-Good thing they cant accumulate many forces outside our walls, this mountains facilitate our job a lot.
- Indeed Lady Eyleen.  Notes the commander  Our forefathers have chosen the place well. There is no way our walls will be breached, now that we have so many people working to defend the walls.
- Even if they rise from the grave no one will attach those limbs back , and well those catapults will be hard to rebuild, We must burn the corpses, to prevent any more unwanted resurrections.
- Yes my lady, and look the sky is getting brighter, the sun is coming.
Eyleen nods  Still we better keep our eyes peeled, we must not get too cocky, lets ask the stone smiths to rebuild the walls, ah and ask the mages to reinforce the magic wards too. For now the shifts will remain the same, not double shifts or anything like that, people must be well rested, this will be a battle that requires brains.
Eyleen sends a small prayer to Mishakal, this city must last.

as the two thousand sky knights and one thousand un mounted

and fly till the reach the mountain range, using it as a landmark, they

A ear splitting roar can be heard, approaching from behind, and 
above the undead legion. The undead have but a few breaths to 
prepare themselves before the Solamnic war cry rings out, just as the 
first wave of the dragons descends on the legion, unleashing  a 
devastating  shower of ice unto the undead. Freezing, if not shattering
hundreds of them in the first pass. 
 
As the second wing of dragons enters the battle, the un mounted 
dragons, dive at the front on the undead lines. They drop from the 
sky, and wrap their arms around the undead siege weapons, lifting 
them high into the air. The fly over the ranks of undead archers, and 
send the heavy weapons falling back to the earth, crushing  many of 
the undead under splintered wood and metal.
 
   Tharm leads the third wing of dragons into battle. He flies astride 
the Mighty Drake Darlantan, a drake who fought in the war of the 
lance, a fearsome and experience dragon. As Darlatan unleashes his 
breath upon the undead, he turns onto his back, allowing Tharm to 
strike out with his long lance, skewering a few undead. Taking them 
into the sky with him and Darlantan. As the reach a more than lethal 
height, he flicks the lance, sending the corpses tumbling back down 
into the ranks.
 
  He looks down into the field of battle. The fierce and rapid assault 
of the Sky knights has taken a devastating toll on the legion, 
thousands lay frozen and in ice pieces in the dirt. Thousands more lay 
crushed under heavy stones and their own siege weapons. Many 
Many more, lay wounded and dying from the lances of the sky 
knights.
 
      Tharm raises his weapon once more, His voice ringing out above the 
sounds of Battle,"{c To the line, the unburden dragons at point. Fly 
low, let you claws rip the undead from the earth. The second wing, 
Unleash Your Breath across the field.{X" 
 
   He levels his weapon to the undead as he joins the ranks preparing 
to dive."{c Let not one of the corpse's shamble from the field.!{X" 
 
    As his call rings out, three thousand dragons pass over the field, 
unleashing a icy death to any unfortunate to be caught in its wake. 
Hundreds more are plucked from the earth, to be sent sailing to the 
deaths against the hard dirt of the field.

Zeath paces back and forth and mumbles to him self. The guard watches and speaks up afters this has gone on for a few hours. "{DM'Lord if your worried about the troops then why not go over see them?{x" Zeath turns and snaps back. "{mBecause if I get involved then Darkahn will use ....

When Zeath and the zombie appear things look some

The ballista and arrows pass through his body as he races towards the War Priest Lich Zuberi. As he gets closer he dismisses the wraith form. "{mZuberi take the clerics tend to those that ain't badly damage get a cleric or two to every group.{x"

"{mBy the Death Lords command he is not your leader I am now go buff the men heal the wounded. NOW GO OR YOU WON'T BE SHEDDING BLOOD THIS DAY NOR ANY OTHER'S!{x" Zuberi hurry's off. Zeath turns to those at his command.
He goes about picking fifty of the most promising mage's. "{mBreak the enchantment on that wall all work as one!{x" Zeaths picks another small group and as he does he notices a Rogue Mage off in the distance. He looks over the men and women he has chosen. "{mYou my select twenty-five will be coming with me. Find the warlord tell him to be ready.{x"
Twisting the shadows around him he steps out behind the young water elf. He folds his arms and glares be for speaking. His tone is as dry and dull as his skin "{mSo you stand back and watch and do nothing what are you planning where do your allegiance lay.{x".
He doesn't turn he keep's watching as he speaks "{yAs you may have guessed I have none I simply go where the wind and sea takes me.{x"

"{mKeep it up its starting to weaken{x" Though he knows that they barely weaken it but even this small lie will help boost moral.
 
Zeath pops up behind Zuberi "{mLeave some one in charge we go find the warlord we take this fight inside.{m" As Zuberi finish patching. He turns his head. "{cWhat do you have in mind M'Lord not all of us can pass through the shadows or gate?{x". "{mLet's just say I've found a way and leave it at that. {x" They hurry to find Dontavius an Kyntari.
 
When the two catches up Zeath and Dontavius exchange words. High in the sky the drakes can be seen, Zeath tosses a flask to Zuberi and Dontavius they catch them despite Zuberi almost dropping his. "{mDrink those quickly. Kyntari wraith form now!{x" As he says this he shimmers into a wraith like form.  Zeath gives them orders on where to meet.

Arlanthis found himself suddenly outside the western gate of Palanthas in the brush.
The God Chislev had sent him here via her torrent of plants and earth.He stumbled out the bushes and emptied his stomach on the side of the road.
Life would take some getting used to again, but Arlanthis was confident.In all things.
 
He noticed a cart slowely churning down the road toward him from the west.He knew the gates of Palanthas would be guarded and security would be high
with the undead forming in the east.Afterall, he had placed them there.
 
He hid just behind the bush he originaly came out in a crouch, careful not to step in his own vomit.
Images of long nights at Myrtal's flashed through his mind.Thats where he had to go.
The cart rumbled closer and he could see it was just a farmer and his wife with a cart loaded with hay for horses and fruits for the market.
"Good" he thought as the cart passed and he crept from his position of hiding toward the back of the cart, "The city will need your food in the days to come good sir."
he whispered to himself as he lept quietly into the hay.
 
He had plenty of time to plot what he would tell Myrtal, if he was still the owner of a bar, as the cart rumbled down the road.
The incredibly high chances the guards would search the hay didnt even cross his mind.He figured the god's looked out for him thus far alittle more wouldnt hurt.
 
Arlanthis could smell the fresh air and he felt full of life.He gripped the hilt of his sword as he heard a guard call out "Whoa there" and the cart screech to a halt.
He felt the voice scratch at the back of his head and he released his grip. "No, thats not me anymore.Not these good men."
he said to himself with a mouthful of hay.The farmer at the front called back "Hay for m'lord Dranth at the stable sir, and fruit for the market is all."
There was a long pause and Arlanthis could feel the guards questioning glare.
"Oh Tibbolt, I know your business.You and your wife have only made this trip every month for twenty years."
The group shared a laugh and the gates could be heard swinging open and the cart begin to move.
Arlanthis grinned to himself, "And just like that, youve still got it lad."
Now, to Myrtal's and many an explanation and pitcher of ale.

With a grunt, Tharm pushes himself from the dirt. A sharp 
pain in his right arm as he does so. Shaking his head, he manages to 
clear the blurriness and dizziness to get a baring of his surroundings.  
Looking to his left, he can See Darlantan going through similar 
motions to regain its bearing. Shaking his head, the drake finds its
feet. The Blast that hit the drake, was powerful, greatly wounding and 
scarring the drakes chest. But was not enough to fell the dragon. The 
dragons wings hung limp, one bent awkwardly where it meets its 
back. 
 
     Tharm Gets to a knee, then his feet and staggering his way to the 
Drake, his right arm hanging limp. He falls into the drakes  side as he 
reaches him, swaying slightly he asks,"{C Get it together friend, we are
no longer above the battle field, but on it.{X" 
 
  Darlantan Cranes his neck slightly, as if nodding."{W Keep your wits 
about  you Knight, they are almost upon us.{X"
 
  Tharm turns to greet the shambling corpses of the legion as the rush 
the fallen dragon, calling to him his lance, he steps forward, impaling 
the first of the undead. The corpse burns with white fire . The 
spectacle is little compared to the mighty cone of ice Darlantan 
releases into the advancing soldiers. Tharm swings his lance horizontal 
before him, sweeping it through several of the undead each burning 
to ash as the lance touches them.
 
   Darlantan moves agile around Tharm, sweeping his tail to send three 
or more of the undead tumbling and soaring through the air to be 
crushed when they meet the packed dirt. Darlantan ignores the pain 
in his chest and wing, moving about to keep the undead at bay, as 
Tharm works alongside him to keep any that make it past the 
wounded dragons guard .

The cart went on its rounds through the market unloading fruit, all the while Arlanthis sat motionless in the hay, praying he wouldnt be noticed.
The gods felt kind this day.After a few close calls the cart pulled into the stable at Dranth's.
He could hear the cart driver and Dranth talkin business and then the man walking away,
Footsteps coming closer and closer, the soud of a pitch being dragged from its place and hoisted.
Sweat formed on Arlanthis' brow and he cursed the gods turn of favor.What would he tell Chislev if the new flesh givin to him
was squandered by a pitchfork while he crept in hay.No.He would gamble that being Dranth by the grunt and quickness of step.
 
Arlanthis sprang suddenly from the hay, arms in the air."Dranth its me!" he called out quickly as Dranth's eyes widened and he made for the lunge.
He paused suddenly and squinted, "Arlanthis?! You crazy headed fool. What are you doing in that pile of hay son?!" Dranth said with shock.
"I had heard you had went to the other side.I had heard you were undead." he paused but kept the pitchfork raised,"I hadn't seen you come by for horse number ten thousand
in years it musta been.I thought surely the rumors true and one of my best customers lost." the man grinned.
Arlanthis chuckled with his old type of laugh he used to get out of tight spot.
"Dranth, surely your mistaken.I was just asleep." he winked and Dranth grinned back.
Arlanthis relaxed and brushed some stray hay off his shoulder, "As you can see sir, ive come to save the day!"
Dranth lowered the pitchfork and they both laughed and embraced.
 
Arlanthis jumped down from the cart and tossed a coin up to the still grining Dranth.He caught it out the air like he did it everyday.
"Annnnnd I'll be needing a horse." Arlanthis hopped onto the nearest economy horse and smiled, "This will do. come to Myrtal's later and we'll have a drink. on me old friend."

Arriving at Myrtal's by secret back entrance, Arlanthis snuck into the scene.
His long time friend and crafter of fine beverages Myrtal stood in the back room washing dishes, usual fake scowl on his face.
Arlanthis knew him to be a good, fun natured man on the inside.
Arlanthis announced his presence with his old call he would make from the back door.
A mixture of antelope call and flatulence, Myrtal loved it and it was signature.No mistaking whom that was.
 
Myrtal dropped his plate with a crash and spun, patrons could be heard yelling and carrying on about wanting drinks in the room just beyond.
"You sly devil.What in the god's names did you get yourself into this time?"
he laughed and hesitated for an embrace, "You arent going to rip my throat out are you? Myrtal said with a sarcastic grin.
"I dunno, we'll see what happens after a few dark ales." Arlanthis replied back with a grin.
 
The two exchanged stories for a moment keeping the throngs at the bar on hold and Myrtal filled Arlanthis in on
The goings on of the day and the undead invasion looming.Nothing Arlanthis didnt already know.
About halfway through the story of how he got here in the hay the door burst open and solamnic guards could be heard
yelling, "The city is under attack!" and patrons and waiters alike fled the bar.
Arlanthis and Myrtal peeped around the corner and the empty room and nodded to each other.
Arlanthis could hear the clatter of battle off into the distance and he shifted hsi sword belt and threw a large bag of coin to Myrtal.
"For the celebration later my friend.Palanthas needs me now" and off he went into the frenzied streets.

off running.Weither it was his commanding voice or the boy was just waiting for anyone to tell him what to do Arlanthis would never know, but he would take it.
 
He kicked his random brown stable horse from Dranth in the flank with the heel of his boot and it took off running.
He weaved through and past pedestrians as he raced toward the square.He just knew he had to get there.
 
He turned the corner by the cleric into the square with a thunder of hooves, his horse givings its all.Dranth sure did know how to pick em.
Arlanthis was thankful for he couldn't have arrived at a better time.
A lone sword knight stood leaning with a broken arm, Crysania and her two crown protectors were nearby.An elven woman by the fountain and just past her....Dontavius.
 
Dontavius stood looming, a menacing form.The lust for blood behind his eyes.As soon as the two noticed each other an ominous form waved past Arlanthis
and he knew there were more.
How many more he wasnt sure but he knew he couldn't leave the knight to fight alone.
Without words the knight grouped with Arlanthis on arrival and the staredown begin...

"In a pickle friend?" Arlanthis leaned down from the saddle with a grin and said to the knight.
"Tharm, Knight of the sword." the man replied with his own grin, but they both knew the situation.
"Outnumbered with innocents around....these are my favorite." Arlanthis said to himself in his head as he stared across the courtyard at Dontavius, his former student.
He had been named Warlord by the powers that be, one Arlanthis himself once wore like a badge, now he would put that to the test.
 
He tried reason first, not his usual tendancy, but he had promised the God Chislev he would not squander this life and would use it for good.
"Come all this way just to die here before Paladine, Dontavius?!" Arlanthis yelled out.
Dontavius just glared back, a determined servant of Chemosh, and he knew he had shadowy backup.
Arlanthis grinned after no response for he knew this one was bold.
Arlanthis whistled and uttered a mgical word and Alea, Captain of the guard, his forever friend arrived with sword already drawn.
She thirsted for blood.By the gods she was thirsty.She always had been ever since Arlanthis had first swooned her favor.
 
Alea and the knight Tharm circled around the side and Arlanthis dug through his bag.
Fingers searching for dangerous scrolls, and they were not dissapointed.
They wrapped around one of Arlanthis' favorites from long ago he had been saving for a rainy day and produced it.
By the bulge in Dontavius' eyes arlanthis could tell he knew its purpose, and by the way him and his corhorts moved back a pace, he knew they were smart.
 
The undead invaders glanced at each other and nodded them fled into the shadows just as quickly as they came in.
Dontavius yelled back, "Another day Arlanthis!" and the trio relaxed...
Arlanthis and the knight grinned to each other again, content the undead were gone for now.But how long....?

The grave was unmarked.  He had heard tales of its location over the years. The resting place of the Lich Lord Mikhal Emenius.  The Emenius name had taken a beating over the centuries.  
He approached it slowly, contemplating his next action. 
So this was it.  Where he had been destroyed. '' He met his demise right here. '', thought Reeve as his eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness of the dimly lit cavern.  ''The Black Dragon of Dargaard finally got tired of his bickering, so they said. ''
Legend has it that the minions of Dargaard took what few bones were left of the necromancer and dug a hole in the moist ground at their feet and tossed them in.  The Dragon had had enough of his rants and off-the-wall tactics.
Reeve knelt to the ground, mud now covering his knees. ''It was said that you committed unimaginable acts of tyranny, great-grandfather.  It was said that you held great strength and power, yet you let it cloud your mind.''  Reeve hesitated, an uneasy feeling overcoming him.

''So this is it....'', Reeve thought, as he approached the make-shift burial location.  His eyes adjusted slowly to the dimly lit cavern.  Two bones, tied together with vines made a rugged marker for the grave. 
''The legends are true...'', he thought. 
The Emenius name had taken a beating over the years.  Campfire and tavern stories told tales of unimaginable acts committed by the infamous necromancer.  The Master of Golems was a treacherous mage, conniving and evil. 
Corrupted by the folklore of Death and tainted by the strength of being reborn, the Lich Lord Mikhal Emenius went mad, in the end......nothing but a Collector of Bones, pacing his study deep within the Undead Caverns, barking orders to minions and ranting at the echo of his own voice in the halls of the keep. 
Legend stated that the Black Dragon of Dargaard had enough.  It swallowed the necromancer whole, spitting up a few bones.  A few loyal servants clawed at the mud at their feet, burying the remaining few bones of the necromancer right here.....where it all happened.
Reeve plopped to his knees. He began to dig.  He muttered, '' Great-grandfather. Your bones will teach me soooo much. ''

A low, wistful song, played on a wooden pipe, floats through the trees
that make up the small Temple.  The piper sits on a low branch of a tree,
her eyes downcast as she allows the music to flow from her.  The song
mirrors her mood -- having just said farewell to the love of her life and
awaiting the return of her precious son to her.  She ought to have been
continuing her duties, but her mind is elsewhere...  In Wayreth...  
 
The kagonesti finishes her song reluctantly, and sighs as she climbs
to her feet.  She pockets the pipe in a bag to her side, stretching
her arms and legs before she moves through the Temple with her things.
She has much work to do -- she goes over the list of things in her
mind....
 
{C...I'll need to travel to Solace, find if there are any there who
may be interested in the transition... Food and lodging for the return

In the hollowed out tree along the path to Solace, Silvaria finds the
elderly qualinesti elf, Tok, and his mix-blooded adopted son, Jerrell.  She
had fallen deathly ill in the forests, when, perhaps by the will of the
Beast, herself -- this unlikely pair had stumbled upon her.  They proceeded
to care for her over the passing days, offering her and the entourage of
mages and other folk who came to help her a safe, dry place to stay.  
 
Tok refuses at first, but Silvaria had expected that. Their history
extends far beyond the week she had spent in his hospitality. In the end,
it is Jerrell who convinces the elderly qualinesti. Tok agrees to come,
only under the agreement that he be permitted to supply leather-crafted
goods to the clan. Jerrell states his interest in learning to become a guard.
'{yEver since your friend in the dark robes gave me a new leg, I've been
really trying my hardest to find a way to thank him. Do you think that
would be good enough?!{X' It is with a beaming grin that Silvaria leaves,
setting off down the road on foot, as to stretch her legs and travel
casually.
 
It is onto Solace next, but Silvaria doesn't expect what she finds along
the way. She has made a small camp for the evening, knowing that she
could make it to Solace before the night was over, but opting to rest
instead. She is reflecting on the absence of her own son, and wondering
if he had stayed with his father, or if he is in the Forester Temple,
waiting for her and wondering where she is. That she doesn't know makes
her slightly anxious -- until a peculiar sound catches her attention.
 
She is on her feet in a moment, her hands hovering over her the hilts
of her daggers. '{CWho goes there...?{X' she calls out softly, knowing
she is at a disadvantage. Her campfire allows them to see her -- but she
cannot see out past the line of trees.
 
It is only a few tense moments before a scrawny figure stumbles into
Silvaria's camp. The kagonesti's scarred face lights up with shock and
dismay. '{C...Iryli?!{X' she exclaims, dashing forward towards the
famished girl. Indeed, the tribe-mate from her childhood, viewed mostly
as a cousin, stands before Silvaria, but is terribly emaciated. The Keeper
of the Foresters brings her close to the fire, giving her water and salted
rations that she had brought for the journey. Though the darker-skinned
kagonesti was coherent, she soon fell asleep in Silvaria's small tent,
leaving Silvaria awake for much of the night. She calls out into the dark
occasionally, with a low whooting noise, but there is no response to it.
 
Her trip to Solace is effectively postponed, as Silvaria moves to get
Iryli back to the Forester Temple as soon as she can. She is glad for her
Goddess's grace, as she summons her unicorn from the sun's bright golden
rays of morning sunlight. When they arrive, the kagonesti finds herself
reunited, not only with the owl she had been calling for in the forests
the night before, but a beautiful, long black cobra. She thinks to herself,
as Iryli is brought into Golametti's hut and made comfortable upon a bed,
{C...This is life. This is what I have been missing... How am I so lucky
to have found it now...{x'

Darkness.  This was the eternal constant within the ocean depths. 
Certainly, there were often times where some sort of bioluminescence shown
through -- the glowing orbs of undersea life trying to entice creatures
which had wondered too low of an anglerfish, or the star-like jellyfish
which lit up the waters as she imagined the night sky did.  No other light
found its way, however.  Xinaesa had little idea what she looked like.  She
knew that she was one of the most changed of the Mahkwahb, with little
evidence that "dolphin" blood had ever been in her ancestry.  Pallid skin

the color of the sea sand, hair as dark as the deepest waters, and eyes that
shimmered crimson like the scales of a sea serpent.  But she had never seen
her reflection at her home -- she had to rely on the appearance of her
hands, and how others spotted her.  Then again, she did not have much an
idea of what others looked like either; their scent and the sight of their
heat was all she had to go by.  Her tribe was little known -- whispers,
rumors.  They had long forsook the creature forms of their ancestors,
forsook their gods, forsook Habbakuk.  They embraced Zurra -- Zeboim, almost

universally.  She was the true master of the seas, and they could feel it in
their blood when they took their shark forms more than any other time.  The
dead of their tribe were never wasted, of course.  Their bodies were
typically abandoned, for they knew that rest was finite, though the hunger
was endless.  Xinaesa had seen for herself her elder sister return, still
with a spear through her bleeding heart, touched by Undeath.  Her sister had
been a great hunter -- the pride of her family.  But there were taboos even
the Mahkwahb held, and in Xinaesa's mind, she had violated them.  To mock

Zeboim was blasphemy.  The gift of Eternal Hunger was not one her sister
planned to wait for.  She wanted the power then and now, and she embraced a
foreign god -- learning from a tome dropped from the land-dwelling peoples
of "Chemosh."  Xinaesa had hoped to end her sister's blasphemies then and
there.  Instead, she found her coming back to life, just the same -- though
by whose touch she did not know.  And now, she was fleeing -- for she had
violated another one taboo herself by killing her only sibling.  Fratricide.
For the first time in her as of then short life, she felt something akin to
sorrow.  Not so much as the loss of her sister, but the loss of her home.  
 
So she swam -- up to the verboten surface.

She swam -- upwards.  Her shark form allowed her to quickly rend the
flesh of prey, and her speed was immense -- more than it would have been in
an elven form.  Either form, of course, would have been an ample target for
the other races which despised both her abyssal family and the sharks of the
oceans.  The growing light from above impeded her progress.  Her eyes could
not adjust, as much as she wanted to.  She was now truly an outcast, and
there was no going back.  Part of her wanted to take in this newfound world,
the new sights and sounds -- and tastes.  The other part loathed every

moment, however.  The surface was getting closer, now.  She had managed to
avoid her own predators -- and there was something in her that called her
on, whether inspiration or curiosity.  She stopped, however, struggling
against something as the sight of the moons reflected against the water. 
She morphed back into her elven body, finding herself trapped within a
fishing net.  Scarlet eyes peered about, noting the amount of lesser sea
creatures that were stuck with her, sloshing about in their desperate
struggles for freedom.  The girl let out a scream underwater, trying to

unbind herself -- but she had no weapons to cut free, no tools to utilize. 
Hours passed like this; much like the fish about her, she made a desperate
attempt for freedom, her screams interlaced with prayers to Zeboim spoken
out loud.  She thought for a moment they had been answered as she felt the
net tug.  The sun's rays blinded her, however, and as she was withdrawn from
the water, words came in tongues she did not know -- along with the hard

impact against the wooden surface of the ship.  Her twisted body was almost
crushed by the weight of the fish which spilled onto her.  The impact alone
had hurt, and the bizarre feeling of being out of the water was maddening. 
She had never used her lungs before -- and in desperate sputters the gills
at the sides of her neck tried at first to take in air.  
 
The stench, however, gave her some orientation. It was a wooden ship,
and she was the only elf -- and the only female, judging by the pheromones
she felt raging.

She could not understand what the words meant as the beasts around her
spoke -- nor could she open her eyes, never having seen the sun before. 
'{rSurely she's dead?  {x' one minotaur grumbled.  '{rBy Sargas, I've never
seen one so -pale- before...  With such strange colors...  {x' The net was
cut, and from the slimy creatures she too was fished out, lifted up by her
shoulder by what felt like a single, massive hand.  '{yDhrogor think must be
gift of Dark Lady for voyage,{x', a barbaric looking human spoke, perhaps
interbred with an ogre.  His stench was the worst -- and she fought to open

her eyes to see him.  She could not identify the half-ogre, nor the
minotaurs that made up the rest of the crew.  She had never seen them
before, nor been taught of them.  In either fear or ignorance she tried to
claw her way free, gasping now for air with previously unused lungs.  She
spat out in her tongue, despite knowing subconsciously they could not
translate, '{dRelease me!  {x' Her words drew only mocking jests and
laughter from the crew.  '{RAye, she's a live one!  Dhrogor, let her go and
see what she does!  {x' a minotaur with a broken horn mocked.  The half-ogre
tossed her back against the flopping fishes, displaying her nakedness for
all to see as she landed.  She tried to stand, but the adrenaline pumping in
her veins combined with never having been standing outside of the water,
resulted in her giving little else than a tumble like a drunkard.  Her kind
had never been self-conscious about nakedness; at most, they were typically
covered in little else than seaweed, if anything at all.  But the looks on
their faces set her senses at all warning -- she felt conscious of her
nakedness here.  '{yShe has many scar.  Warrior,{x' Dhrogor stated, pointing
at her with an index finger.  Her eyes blurred as she tried to take in his
appearance, noting that his muscles rivaled the minotaurs' own.  "{dHumans

are bigger than I imagined,{x" she thought -- out aloud.  He seemed to
notice her trying to peer at him, and took a step back, frowning.  She
grinned, bearing the characteristically sharp teeth of her race.  Finally,
she stood up, letting the seawater run down her white flesh.  The minotaurs
all stood at a distance, watching as she turned around, stepping like a

cautious child up to the front of the boat.  She still could not entirely
see, but she could tell that this part was the least manned -- and the
easiest way to escape.  Those who faced her back saw the ornate
scarification of a spiked shell -- a symbol of Zeboim.  '{rBy Sargas...  {x'
one started, with a frown.  If they had any inkling of releasing her,
however, it disappeared when she unleashed a barrage of fireballs at two of
them.  Dhrogor stroked at his triple-braided beard, seeming to think for a
long moment.  '{yShould throw back.  Not anger Dark Lady's daughter.  {x' 
 
 
If there was any inkling of an agreement, it disappeared when she
began her barrage of fireballs.

She was pleased to see that the spell functioned as well as it did in the
water, but the minotaurs easily evaded her attacks -- they were trained
warriors.  '{BShe's a rotting, stinking, mageling!  {x' one hissed, coming
down hard from behind her and slamming her to the ground.  She could smell
the burning wood of the ship, but the minotaurs were quick to douse the
flames with water -- throwing some of the soaked fish ontop of the flames. 
"Throw her in!"  A chorus called.  "A sacrifice to the Condor!"  The
half-horned minotaur shook his head, holding her up high by her hair.  She

gagged desperately for air, clawing at his hand in an attempt to fight for
her freedom.  Dhrogor folded his arms, frowning as he watched.  'No,' the
minotaur stated.  'As our halfling friend here said,' he snorted, 'We should
consider her a gift.  Who's first?  ' The half-ogre looked away, turning as
he headed back under the deck -- not wanting to give any witness to what h e
knew would occur.  There was no fear in Xinaesa's heart as she finally

caught breath back.  Only hate.  She could not understand the words, but she
knew the looks -- the same looks that many of her own tribe had given her,
before she speared them through the throats.  '{dSo this is how it ends... 
{x' she thought.  It was the last clear thought that went through her head
for days.  She had never endured such pain.  Even the scarification on her
back paled in comparison.  The rape itself was not the worst; the feeling of
air against her as her gills dried, the wounds they left as she was chafed
against the wood.  She begged for death, now -- wanting to return as her
sister had to take vengeance on the ship.  She felt abandoned -- where was
her goddess to protect her?  She felt the rope at her feet tie as the day
retreated into night.  She had exhausted herself from screams and pain, and

now was mostly numb.  There was some feeling of confusion as she was lifted
up and carried towards the edge of the ship; she did not bother screaming as
she was tossed over, nor did she resist as she was keelhauled underneath,
blood gushing from the wounds that opened up at her flesh.  If anything, the
icy water's embrace was a welcome change.  The mocking laughs continued as
several of the beasts watched blood rise to the surface.  They did not stay

to see the end results, though they also did not notice that Dhrogor
remained behind -- they were too drunk on alcohol and sex to care.  Dhrogor
had not touched her.  The blasphemy of the so-called warriors he traveled
with to disrespect her so nagged at his sense of honor.  His clan was not

the same as the savages that many were used to.  "{yWe are a race of proud
warriors.  From Kilgor, to Gulgor...  {x' he thought -- his words much more
ornate in his head and mother tongue.  '{yI don't know if I'm too late, sea
creature,{x' he thought, coming to where Xinaesa's rope tied to the deck. 
He pulled out a dagger from the sheath of his boot and began to cut.  '{y...
But I hope your goddess keeps you safe.  {x' The rope snapped, and the
abyssal elf was carried adrift, unconscious and bleeding, by the endless
ocean.

Screaming is heard within the conclave halls, seemingly from Lunitari's altar atop one of the towers. Inside, a red robe is in a struggle, arcane distortions spewing from the cracks of the door. The mage is ravaged from what seems to be self-inflicted scars from head to toe. "{rMercy, Maiden, mercy! Save your humble servant from the chains that bind him!{x" the man shouts. The mentally ill mages prayer goes unanswered, his mind's battle for dominence never ceasing.
With the last bits of strength left in his body, he casts a simple spell of mirror. Four bodies appear, looking like the mage in every way. "{rPlease,{x" he whispers, his body failing as he loses conciousness. The room is filled with laughter as the torches shine an ominous red filling the room with blinding light. When the light dies down, the four mirrors stir. 
They seem to have gained a new appearances. First, there is a woman with long red hair, small waist, large bust, and wearing a kimono-style red robe. Second, a red haired muscley man wearing red plate armor. Third, a cynical looking man, having long black hair, grey robes, and houses similar scars to the original mage. The last of the ex-mirrors is the first to stand, a perfect mirror of the original except for the scars and seems to be a younger version, having smoother skin and more youthful eyes.
The original mage lay on the ground, scars gone. His mind sane and some energy restored, he stirs with the mirrors. When each of them reach their feet and gain some composure, there is an awkward silence as each looks about the altar. There is no question as to who each of them are, for they had fought inside the mages mind for so long. Each was given a nickname, however cliche they might have been, of {cFate{x, {yYang{x, {rRage{x, {mAffinity{x, and {CHonor{x.
It was not long before the casting of spells and the clashings of metal had begun. Screams, yelling, and a still-laughing voice can be heard from the tower. Corpses started to pile, only to become lifeless, stiff, then erode as all mirrors do. The battle came down to {mAffinity{x, a loving and beautiful mistress of illusions, {cFate{x the original mage himself, and {yYang{x the embodiment of his pain and darker thoughts. 
Rage had rushed in mindlessly only to be slaughtered, while Honor was backstabbed by Yang when he begged for protection. The mistress Affinity stayed calm, either hands hovering parallel to the ground in preperation of casting, eyes locked on the other two. Yang grinded his teeth in anger, glaring at the original mages body with bloody intent in his eyes. Fate was weary to fight, let alone engage, these two for he knew what they were capable of from when they had control of his mind. 
He backs up to a wall, placing a hand against it while watching the other two closely. He speaks a few words, a smile forming as a gate seems to form on the wall, though it is quickly shattered with an explosion.
An illusion fades, the mage standing in the center of the room. There was no wall behind him, no gate, only a sense of confusion as the mistresses illusion ceases to be. Only Yang, smirking with a hand on fate's back, stands behind him. Searing skin remains where the unscarred flesh on his back once was, the pain rushing quickely into his senses. He lets out a bloodchurning scream, dropping to his knees and panting. Yang marvels in his pain, for once it had not been placed on him. 
Affinity takes this chance to escape out of a gate. With a grit of his teeth and a growl, fate turns on Yang, plunging them both into a gate as well. The two appear in the sky just south of the temple of paladine in palanthas. Fate fell onto stone ground, while yang fell into the fountain, breaking his fall. Fate's target, his friend and high cleric, Sera, sits nearby... and such, the three aspects of Fyrah were released, each of them attempting to carry the same name.

The hammock that hangs outside of the Healer's Hut creaks softly as it sways
to and fro. The kagonesti that rests in it breathes a soft sigh, longing for
the young boy who usually accompanies her here. In the absence of his
presence, though, she forces her mind to travel in a different direction.
With a sigh, she sits up and moves to her bag, which sits in its own alcove,
within the Healer's Hut. The elder druid is absent, allowing Silvaria's
thoughts to be focused on the roll of paper she pulls from the bag. It is
weathered, but she had expected that. There is little she can do to protect
such things from the elements here.
 
Unrolling the paper reveals a floorplan that she considers carefully. The
floor of the Healer's Hut is soil, but it is packed down hard by the amount
of people who move through it by day and by night. She spreads this roll of
paper out and pulls out a pen and a pot of black ink from her bag.
 
'{CPerhaps... I can find someone who can make instruments...{X' she thinks
aloud, adding the thought underneath a note that marks where a Temple to
Branchala might go. '{C...And here... Where Druids can come to train their
skills... I will need to speak again with Amon...{X' she mutters. '{CThe
Main Hall of the Temple ought to be in a tree... an enormous tree. Where
better to be reverent of the Cycle than in then embrace of one of Her
most cherished creatures...?{X'
 
Silvaria's work on the floorplan continues well through the day,
regardless of those who walk through the Healer's Hut. It is only once
nighttime has fallen, and she can no longer work by the light of the day
that Silvaria finally rolls up the sheet of paper and stashes it back in
her bag. '{C...It will be beautiful...{X' she murmurs aloud.
 
'{yWhat will?{X' The familiar voice of Golametti calls out to her, and so
deeply in her thoughts she had withdrawn, she is startled by it.
 
'{COh. The new Temple, of course,{X' she states, touching her hand to
her heart and chuckling at the elderly druid.
 
Golametti lifts a bushy eyebrow at her, seemingly skeptical. '{y"New"
Temple? What's wrong with -this- Temple, hmmm?{x'
 
Silvaria tilts her head and sighs. '{CNothing is -wrong- with it,
Golametti... But I want to expand upon the beauty here. I want it to be
more of a haven -- and roomier, so we don't feel so cramped.{X'
 
'{y...I think you ought to talk to more people before you start making
such big changes, young one. But, who am I? Just a cranky old druid...
I heard you mumbling about trees over there -- I want my house to stay
right where it is, you hear??{x' he rambles, mumbling to himself in the
Kagonesti tongue as he meanders into his private area of the Hut.
 
Silvaria just shakes her head, grinning slightly after him. She
sighs and tucks her bag into its alcove, before stepping outside of the
Hut and making a soft, hooting call -- then listening close to see if
it is returned.

Some where deep in the dargaard mountains the earth shifts and moves and a burnt corps raises out of the ground.
The corpses eyes blaze with a black fire.  He walks out into the night. His hatred of what he has become fills him.  He speaks words of power and summons his loyal steed. He mounts the nightmare and they take off the dust creates a black cloud. As he rides on into the night he speaks to no one other than himself. "I have so many things time has gone by and I've lost my path some how, I need to try to atone for some of the things I've done. I don't how but I must."
 
When the man finally stops he's in the graveyard in Palanthas where he tends to go when ever he needs to think. He walks to a tomb and opens it and walks deep down into its secret chamber. He sits down and meditates. After about a few minutes deep in thought. He hear's his woman's voice. "{DWhat troubles you my son
Why do you look as some thing plagues you?{x" He does not open his eyes nor does me make any movements as he speaks"{mI lost my way mother I am lost and I'm not sure what to do any more?{x" He feels a soft kiss on his forehead and hears his mother's words. "{DFollow your heart follow in the path you meant to follow go to the tower's.{x" He simple nods and stands he bows before he leaves.
 
Zeath dismisses his nightmare and pulls out some parchment and begins writing a letter.

Heavy clouds hung overhead in the dark night sky, a storm on the brink. Casual 
winds wisps quietly through the small city, bits of leaves flowing through 
the city, trailing from the forest nearby. The animals knew a storm was coming, 
sort of like a special sense. Not a sound could be heard within the city, or forest.
 
A citadel stood tall amongst the small area. South through Vingaard forest, a 
small ways away from the great city of Palanthas, a draconian citadel stood. 
Unknown to many, but revered by few, the citadel stood quietly in the night. 
The normal activity of the draconians were not as usual, in fact... None could be seen.
Deep within the quiet citadel, down many passages and corridors, was a dark room.
Within this room, that seemed darker than every other room amongst the citadel, 
an odd smell arose. The smell wasn't necessarily bad, nor was it good. It didn't 
carry the sweet smell of flowers that could be found within the forest up north 
nor did it carry the smell of death. The smell was just...Different.
Within this odd room was one single light. It did not burn bright, illuminating 
the darkness as it should, but lit just a small corner of the room. However
faint it was, it did reveal an altar. An altar of utmost evil, and built of
obsidian, was erected here for the Dark Queen, Takhisis.
Nearby this obsidian altar, stood two figures, shrouded in the darkness of the room.
The silence, was finally broken as one of the men spoke. A tall, grey cloaked
man stood tall, his eyes opening after who knows how long, "{dI have heard Her words.{X"
The man seemed to be speaking to the other figure that was present.
"{rGood, it has been many hours since you last spoke.{X" The other figure spoke
in reply to the first. The second figure, stepped forward to bring himself
closer to the hooded figure. "{rWhat did she say?{X"
"{dMany hours to you, are mere minutes within Her domain.{X" A raspy reply
is what the hooded figure can offer, his throat dry and cracking, the price
of not speaking, eating, or drinking for many hours. "{dI prayed unto Her,
and she answered.{X" He continued, his voice slowly returning to its normal
sound, "{dWe must go to Santion.{X"
"{rWhy there?{X" The other man asks, his voice bouncing off the short walls
of the dark room, a mild echo occuring.
"{dDo not ask question, Jerrid. It is Her will, and it -must- be done.{X"
"{rThen let's be on our way.{X" Jerrid replies, stepping closer to the altar
a final time before they set upon their journey. As the man steps toward the altar,
to pray, the small light illuminates some of his features. No helm is atop
his head, though he is adorned in armor. Jet black hair, the color of the night
sky falls messily down his head, his shoulders where it stops. His eyes, are
of the deepest of greys, the color of a deep morning fog. They are like a
reflective piece of steel, hiding his soul beneath. Obsidian colored armor
is his adornment, giving way that he is a warrior. Though large and muscular,
standing at a full height of six foot six inches, he is not unharmed. Numerous
cuts and scars align the mans throat, memories of past battles within each.
Unsheathing his blade, with an evil grin, the Knight kneels before the altar.
The obsidian sword swiftly, and with precision, raises in the air as he prays
to the Dark Queen. "{BMay you watch over us on our journey, M'lady.{X"
And with that, the pair set out into the cold, windy night, a long journey
ahead, but with purpose.

carry the sweet smell of flowers that could be found within the forest up north 
nor did it carry the smell of death. The smell was just...Different.
Within this odd room was one single light. It did not burn bright, illuminating 
the darkness as it should, but lit just a small corner of the room. However
faint it was, it did reveal an altar. An altar of utmost evil, and built of
obsidian, was erected here for the Dark Queen, Takhisis.
Nearby this obsidian altar, stood two figures, shrouded in the darkness of the room.
The silence, was finally broken as one of the men spoke. A tall, grey cloaked
man stood tall, his eyes opening after who knows how long, "{dI have heard Her words.{X"
The man seemed to be speaking to the other figure that was present.
"{rGood, it has been many hours since you last spoke.{X" The other figure spoke
in reply to the first. The second figure, stepped forward to bring himself
closer to the hooded figure. "{rWhat did she say?{X"
"{dMany hours to you, are mere minutes within Her domain.{X" A raspy reply
is what the hooded figure can offer, his throat dry and cracking, the price
of not speaking, eating, or drinking for many hours. "{dI prayed unto Her,
and she answered.{X" He continued, his voice slowly returning to its normal
sound, "{dWe must go to Santion.{X"
"{rWhy there?{X" The other man asks, his voice bouncing off the short walls
of the dark room, a mild echo occuring.
"{dDo not ask question, Jerrid. It is Her will, and it -must- be done.{X"
"{rThen let's be on our way.{X" Jerrid replies, stepping closer to the altar
a final time before they set upon their journey. As the man steps toward the altar,
to pray, the small light illuminates some of his features. No helm is atop
his head, though he is adorned in armor. Jet black hair, the color of the night
sky falls messily down his head, his shoulders where it stops. His eyes, are
of the deepest of greys, the color of a deep morning fog. They are like a
reflective piece of steel, hiding his soul beneath. Obsidian colored armor
is his adornment, giving way that he is a warrior. Though large and muscular,
standing at a full height of six foot six inches, he is not unharmed. Numerous
cuts and scars align the mans throat, memories of past battles within each.
Unsheathing his blade, with an evil grin, the Knight kneels before the altar.
The obsidian sword swiftly, and with precision, raises in the air as he prays
to the Dark Queen. "{BMay you watch over us on our journey, M'lady.{X"
And with that, the pair set out into the cold, windy night, a long journey
ahead, but with purpose.

Sun beamed throught the canopy of the forest, illuminating bits and pieces of
the area. The songs of birds could be heard in the distance, singing their
happiest of tunes as they went about their daily happenings. Wildlife playfully
went about their days, a pair of squirrels wrestling and racing up trees for
acorns, while the antelopes darted from tree to tree, not a care in the world.
Beautiful flowers bloomed, the sun gleaming off their dew ridden petals.
But, of all the beauty and quietness of the forest, a small encampment stood.
A large campfire burned, though it was daylight, in a clearing within the
forest. Numerous tents circled around the blazing inferno of the campfire,
its flames almost out of control because the overwhelming amounts of tender.
This, was obviously a camp. Closer inspection would give way that it belonged
to a group of outlaws, or bandits. A few chests lay astray within the camp, 
opened up for all to see. Numerous bags of gold, and jewelry were what lied 
within.

But, of all the beauty and quietness of the forest, a small encampment stood.
A large campfire burned, though it was daylight, in a clearing within the

its flames almost out of control because the overwhelming amounts of tender.
This, was obviously a camp. Closer inspection would give way that it belonged
to a group of outlaws, or bandits. A few chests lay astray within the camp, 
opened up for all to see. Numerous bags of gold, and jewelry were what lied 
within.
A small group of five bandits stood in various spots amongst the camp, 
tending to whatever duties they saw fit. They all were draped in green, to
better camoflauge themselves when they were ambushing trade caravans, or those
foolish enough to wander alone within the forest. Their duties quickly came 
to a halt when a pair of travelers, their next victims, wandered a bit too
close to their camp. "{cOi! Boss!{X" One of the bandits called out, from 
within a tree top, obviously a lookout. The one he called too, the largest of
the entire bunch, stood tall and turned to face the direction of the scout.
"{GAye, what are you pair doing so far from the cities?{X" He beckoned to the
pair wandering to them. He notices that his words to not halt their advance
so he calls again to them "{GYou boys better stop, afore you catch ahold of 
something you don't want ta!{X" He motioned to the rest of his men, and they
immediately began to spread out and circle around the encampment, to trap the
pair. Yet, his words still did not halt their advance. 
As the pair finally draw near, they can be made out to be a grey cloaked
figure, completely shrouded by his hood, and an obsidian colored armor bearing
male, with a sword of equally black color at his waist. The leader of the 
bandit crew, calls to them one last time as he steps to stand before the 
armored male, the grey cloaked figure staying some ways back, "{GYou boys, 
surrender your belongings, and we'll let you walk out of here with your lives.{X"
After his words are relayed to the warrior, he glances the sight of many scars
upon the man's throat, a sign that the pair would be no pushover. The armored
male remains silent, and unmoving. "{GWhat, you got a fucking stick in your 
ear boy? I sai-{X" His words are cut short as the warrior slams his head into
the leader's face, the force of the blow shattering the man's nose, blood 
showering them both. As the bandit leader hits the ground, clutching his face
he screams, "{GMy fucking nose! AAARRAAAAGGGHH! Kill these fuckers, boys!{X"
He got one final glance at his assailant before he drew his last breath that 
day, and all he saw was the devilish grin of a blood covered face standing 
over him. And a black blade expertly cutting through the air.
The blade met his throat, and more blood gushed onto the grass and dirt, the
man's crew leaping into action.
A rag tag crew, they did not expect such skill from the warrior. The first of
the crew charging blindly at the man, his demise coming quickly as the 
warrior turned and rammed every inch of his obsidian blade into the thief's 
torso lifting him up off his feet, blood pouring onto him, and the ground 
below. As the man reached the pinacle of the warrior's reach, he was slammed
to the ground with a ferocious force, the blade ripped clean from him, his 
eye's glazing over, his soul forfeit.
Two of the remaining three screamed and charged him at the same time, hoping
to overtake him by numbers rather than skill. But, the warrior was once again
to beautiful a swordsman to be overtaken by such a thing. A maniacal grin was
upon his face the entire time, blood from the first two dripping from his head
with the sweat of the sun beating down on him. His blade locked with the first,
an expertly manuevered parry his reply to the bandits wide swing. As the 
bandits blade bounced off of his, his fist ripped through the air, his obsidian
gauntlet slamming into the bandits face, sending him stumbling back. Just in 
time too, because as he spun back around to meet the second bandit, the warrior
watched as he erupted into a pillar of black and blue flames before him. His
blood curdling scream erupting aloud, reverberating from tree to tree.
 
The warrior turned his head to cast a quick glance at the grey cloaked figure
that he arrived with. Upon doing so, the hooded man stood within the clearing,

that his friend's aid was the workings of a dark god, and he cast aloud his 
thanks, "{rA bit close for comfirt Sarthis.{X"
"{dHurry and kill the others, we must go.{X" the Priest replied, pointing to
the man Jerrid had recently slammed in the face.
When Jerrid turned to face him, the bandit was upon his knees begging for mercy,
his companion, the final of the bandit crew, tearing through foliage, fleeing
for his life. "{cNo no no, please don't kill me PLEASE!{X" His cries of mercy
accompanied by tears of complete and total fear.
Jerrid's only reply, was his usual evil grin, before he rammed his blade through
the bandit's face, his cries for mercy ended abruptly. "{rWhat about the other 
one?{X" Jerrid beckoned to the priest, in regard to the fleeing thief.
"{dLet him go. He will be a warning to all other that seek to block our path.{X"
And with the cleric's reply, the pair continued on their way, their jouney to 
Sanction that much closer to an end.

OOC hang with me, been a long time and im trying to resume my rp from
before and have alittle fun, heres just alittle where i been story.  Hope
you enjoy it.  The battle raged.  Arlanthis, Sinjin, Flarn, and Kur hacked
ruthlessly away at undead corpses before them.  The knights, back to back,
had been fighting a losing battle for days.  Thier Dargaard circle made a
fatal mistake a week back, and underestimated the undead.  The close knit
circle of sword knights and even a few crowns had pursued a vagrant squad of
zombies and skeletons into the deeper regions of the Dargaard valley. 
Nothing out of the normal in itself, this group of seventy-five men
routinely met for clandestine operations into the dark.  Slaying undead was
thier divine duty as they saw it, and they had never known fear.  This
combination had taken them to this point many times before, with much larger
groups, but something had gone horribly wrong this time.  It's almost like
they had been led right into an ambush set up by the mindless corpses some
others might have thought.  However, Arlanthis knew better.  This was too
sophisticated a trap.  After having chased the maurading undead party into a
narrow section of the valley directly to the side of the dark mountain, the
walls had suddenly come alive with boulders and sealed the way they had come
in.  It was too convenient, that and the second wave of undead coming
mysteriously from the brush on thier flank all but sealed it.  He had led
them into a trap, and he knew it And the men knew it.  Only the knowledge
that each and every one of them had sworn the Oath and knew full well the
danger of thier mission kept him from crying out.  He couldn't dwell on that
now though, it was too late.  He had to act.  He looked over his right
shoulder toward Sinjin and the unspoken bond between the two kicked in. 
Sinjin's head turned almost in sync and both men nodded the nod of
understanding.  This fight was lost and it was time to go.  Sinjin started
the motion to break the defensive circle and head toward another pinned down
contengent by the boulder wall.  Arlanthis made the spinning side
walkmeneuver while hacking and Flarn did in turn, but Kur, Kur was having
none of it.  He neither motioned to follow nor registered the command, he
had made up his mind.  With three wild swings of his great sword he broke
rank the opposite direction and proceeded off into the increasing mass of
undead.  His battle cry and several skeletons ripping his face off were the
last Arlanthis ever saw of him.  He didn't even try to stop him, all the men
were exhausted from days of fighting, and none could be told they couldn't
die here.

Arlanthis whispered a silent prayer and followed Sinijn into the fray,
claws and rotting hands missing fingers clutching in vain at his breastplate
and scabbard.  Blood leaked across his vision.  He hoped he still had an
eye.  Suddenly they arrived at the pinned party with a hault.  The defeaning
screams drowned out any talk so Sinjin made a hand motion and Flarn reacted
by slicing a wide gap for Arlanthis to swing up and see for himself with
Sinjin the sight before them.  The men, all his brothers in life, now
carried on without him in death.  Thier twisted and torn expression a horror
for any man to see, veteran soldier be damned.  It was all Arlanthis could
do to hold back tears, he looked around over Flarns flailing slightly under
him at an incline and could behold the battlefield through his good eye. 
All the contengents were down.  Peices of his men and friends were being
carried and paraded about in the what was now an undead swarm.  Far in the
distance standing on a boulder Arlanthis could see a Lich of some sort,
commanding the sea of flesh.  Arlanthis raised his sword slowely and pointed
it out into the distance."  ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" was all he could get
out.  His anger and frustration directed in a phrase toward his foe.  Just
as he was prepared to leap into the crowd headfirst and hack his way all the
way to the Lich he heard it.  Flarn slipped and he heard a soft thud as he
fell into the mud, head split wide open.  He howled and lept down over the
body of his friend and with a supernatural strength grabbed the man with one
arm, flung him over his shoulder armor and all, tossed the body onto the
semi ledge with Sinjin and fought the crowd off at the same time.  Sinjin
helping the corpse up and in turn pulling the bloodlusted Arlanthis up by
his breastplate straps.  "We have to go Arlanthis..."  Said a heavy panting
and serious looking Sinjin."  We cannot bring justice for these men if we
too die."  The short and simple words striking a deep nerve.  Arlanthis
nodded and motioned toward the corpse of Flarn as he kicked off more
zombies.  Sinjin said a prayer and reached down, closing the mans eyes and
looked with sadness at Arlanthis."  We must leave him, we will never make it
over these rocks with that weight.  Arlanthis cursed and turned from the
fray for a moment, "We can't just leave him!  I would never."  And he was
cut off with a strong blow to the side of the head form a particularly large
zombie.  The last thing Arlanthis saw was Sinjin pulling him up and
everything went dark.  When he awoke they were surrounded by clerics, the
chaos of battle suddenly replaced with soft sheets.  He was cleaned and
bandaged nearly from head to toe.  Sinjin in a bed next to him in similar
condition.  A kind looking woman in white leaned over his bed and whispered
"Your friend carried you all the way back Sir, you are safe now."  She rose
and turned to go and before she could Arlanthis groaned out,"Where are we?" 
The lady stopped and turned with a smile, "Why near the High Clerist tower
sir, we will have you and Sir Sinjin back in shape and in Palanthis soon
Sir.  The gods will you made it this time sir, I worried about you for a
moment but I should have known better."  She said with a grin.  "Anything
else sir?"  Arlanthis sighed deep and said calmly through his face bandage,
"No mam, that'll be all."  He could hear her giggle then and then clear her
throat, "Oh and sir.....  Its good to have you back."  Her footsteps fading
off in a hurry.

"Wake up"...  A voice shattered Arlanthis' fevered dream of battle in an
instant.  He knew that voice all too well.  On the battlefield in his mind
it was the voice of Justice itself.  Kiri-Jolith made physical.  In life it
was his friend of all friends, Sinjin Longfellow finley, there with him
through all things and now there at his sick bed.  "The clerics inform me
you are well enough to move.  We should return to the city in haste." 
Arlanthis nodded groggily and stood up slowely in the bed, cursing age under
his breath for robbing him of youthful vigor.  He reached up to his face and
felt were the bandages had covered his left eye."  It's still there." 
Sinjin said with a grin.  "Our clerics are peerless in thier capacity for
such wounds it would seem.  Arlanthis just thanked the gods and gave it no
second thought."  Lets get going then, we don't want to keep the Grandmaster
waiting on our report."  He said with a grunt as he swung his legs out the
bed."  And thats assuming word of our men's fate hasnt already reached his
ear."  Sinjin took a sour expression, "Those men died fulfilling thier Oath.
There can be no greater death."  Both men sat in silent prayer for a moment
until Arlanthis nodded solemnly and mustered onto his feet."  Have a squire
sent to help me with my armor and we shall be on our way."  Sinjin obeyed at
once and departed out the makeshift tent flap.  Arlanthis fitted the last
strap of his breastplate as the young squire sent to him held the reins of
his horse outside the tent.  He took a deep breath, wincing at a still
healing cracked rib, but he had known worse injuries.  He covered his face
with calm reserve and walked out into light.  It took a moment for his eyes
to adjust as as they did he could see men formed in a ring outside the tent.
Sinjin and stood mounted on his own steed besides the squire holding his
directly in front.  All to the sides men with haggard and tired expression,
dirt and horror covered them all.  Remnants from the doomed expidition. 
They all raised thier tired heads to look at him in his freshly redone armor
and freshly washed hair and body.  For just a moment he felt a knot of guilt
in hsi stomach but he supressed it with a cold thought.  These men need me
to look one hundred percent even if I was not.  They needed to know I wasnt
tired even when they were.  They needed to know I was ready to continue the
fight even in the face of defeat.  Arlanthis knew that every one of those
men who died knew thier duty, and that they had not lost a war but just a
small battle, and to concede even a small amount of defeat was to cast the
memory of his men in shame.  He could never do that."  Rally the men!"  He
shouted to Sinjin across the small field as his horse reared back and landed
with a loud thud."  We shall return to Palanthas and gather all the knights!
Evil will know Justice!  Est Sularus oth Mithas!"  The men cheered and
saluted at the same time and the whole company of healers,knights,and
squires made toward the gates of Palanthas in unison.  Arlanthis giving a
slight grin at his own showmanship.  He knew the men would feel better now,
even if in the pit of his stomach dwelled uncertainty.

That wicked aura was illuminating from the pendant again. It had been years. He was shocked at first. But he came to the realization rather quickly that it was time.  Matters were at hand, yes.

The streets of Palanthas had grown quiet in recent months. Law and order had been 
hard fought and won by the efforts of the Crown's favorite knights, and the lawless 
factions that once ruled the streets were now scarcely recognized or feared by the 
populace. It was a calm day, with an overcast sun setting on the horizon, casting off 
amber rays and diffusing the surrounding sky in an attractive red hue.
 
Jafrod was an honest man. He grew up on the now relatively calm street of Smith's 
Alley. Long ago, the Alley was a dangerous part of the city, filled with criminals of all 
factions, races, and sizes. Now peasants leisurely hung their laundry out on the 
lines, smiling and waving as patrols would pass by on adjacent blocks. Jafrod was 
outside his small home on the Alley, scrubbing the dirt off of his facade when he 
heard the first oddity of the day.
 
"Stop that man! Help! Guards!" The shouting was coming from down the street off 
Temple Row. Jafrod put down his rag and straightened himself up to full height. He 
raised an eyebrow and looked in the direction of the shouting. He waited a few 
moments, but no one came running down the Alley as he had expected. Dismissing 
it as a fence getting caught at one of the shops on Temple Row, Jafrod stooped 
down again to resume his chore of cleaning.
 
Jafrod *hated* the simplicity of his life, and more importantly, he *hated* cleaning 
the facade of his home. However, that is what he did, and what he was doing when 
the second oddity of that day occurred to him.
 
Two knights, wearing bright shining armor, carrying ancient halberds marched down 
the Alley, never glancing or acknowledging the peasants that began to assemble in 
front of their homes to see what was going on. Their feet moved in near perfect 
unison, a disciplined march that could only come from the years of training that 
accompany a full ranking Solamnic Officer. These particular knights came from the 
customs post at the docks in the north of the city.
 
The pair stopped, and turned to face Jafrod. Both men had long flowing mustaches, 
and nearly looked identical, the one defining trait between them being the color of 
their mustaches. The man on Jafrod's left had a red mustache, while the one on his 
right wore a dirty blonde. 
 
The "red" knight spoke first :
 
"Citizen of Palanthas, state your name clearly". Jafrod's heart sank into his stomach.
What could these men possibly want?
 
"Uh.. J..Jafrod Bensson sir"
 
Then the blonde knight spoke, "Jafrod Bensson, by order of the Crown your home is 
to be searched for contraband, if you do not comply with this order and grant us 
entry you shall be arrested under the charge of Obstruction of an Official 
Investigation. Do you understand my directive peasant?"
 
Jafrod's stomach turned itself into a knot. Somewhere deep down in his soul, he felt 
a spark, a tiny, miniscule sliver of anger and hatred at this pompous knight and his 
Rule of Law, and he finally responded to the knights,
 
"Yes m'lords, please, enter my home, and search as you like."
 
The knights immediately entered the humble home, barely waiting for him to finish 
accepting their demands. Inside they found little of interest, food stores, a straw 
mattress, dirty walls. The knights rummaged through what little posessions Jafrod 
had, never speaking a word. After about 15 minutes of searching, they exchanged a 
glance with each other, and nodded slowly to each other.
 
"Peasant, Jafrod Bensson" the red knight spoke.
 
"Y-yes sir."
 
"Your home clearly contains no contraband, the Crown thanks you for your compliance"
 
Then the blonde knight added "If you see any strange activity tonight, please report it 
to the City Guard immediately. We are looking for a box containing very dangerous 
contraband, it cleared customs at the port this morning and was marked to be 
delivered to this address." His expression softened a little as he continued, "When 
we discovered our folly in clearing the box we thought you might have already 
received it. Clearly you know nothing of this item."
 
Jafrod was taken aback. Why would a box of contraband be sent to him? Who sent 
it? What contraband was so important that 2 high ranking knights would march 
halfway across the city in search of it?
 
More and more questions raced through his head as he wondered if he were in 
danger. The knights finally excused themselves politely, making Jafrod feel that they 
maybe weren't the pompous jackasses who demanded their way into his home after 
all. As soon as he saw them clear the Alley and disappear off to the south, he 
rushed back inside his home and bolted the door.

As the first rays of Solinari began to light the sky, Jafrod moved over to his straw 
bed to prepare himself to sleep off the memories of the strange evening he just had, 
when the final oddity of the day occurred.
 
Right next to his bed, a large oaken box, heavily battered, was laid out upon his 
floor. "This wasn't.. no one has been in here?!" Jafrod began looking around the 
room, afraid that there might be someone else in his home. He examined the box 
closely, there were no identifying markers to show its origin, only Jafrod's address 
carved into the bottom edge of one of the sides, and the letters "NS" branded upon 
its top side.
 
Jafrod started toward his door to summon the guard. But then that spark of hatred 
flared to a small flame, and Jafrod remembered the pompous demeanor the knights 
presented their order to him with. Those knights weren't like him, they didn't scrub 
the shit off their crappy hovel every day, they didn't know what the struggle he went 
through every Winter was like. There was no compassion for him there, only a stupid 
peasant in the way of their investigation.
 
He returned to the box, and took a shim to pry the nails out of it. Once he got the top 
off, he dropped his tool to the floor, stepping back slowly his mouth agape.
 
"What-- w-who?? By the Gods.."
 
Inside the box lie an elf, dressed in all black, most of his features covered up by his 
clothing. He immediately sat up. His voice rang out across the room "Thank you Mr. 
Jafrod, it was quite uncomfortable in there." The elf climbed out of the box and onto 
his feet, not making a sound as they hit the floor.
 
"H-how did you know my nam--why are you here?"
 
The elf turned his head slightly, and the shadow of his hood revealed a beeming, 
perfect smile. "I know a lot about this place, this street, and the people that live here, 
Jafrod."
 
"The knights, they were looking for YOU. Who are you, and why are you so important 
to them?"
 
The elf quickly made his way to the door. Slipping past Jafrod with effortless speed 
and motion. "My name is D'Kyeas D'Nolououn, but in the common tongue I'm often 
called the NightStalker." And he slipped out into the night.
 
Jafrod's mouth again fell open in disbelief. "No.. I mean it can't--he's dead!" He 
walked back over to the opened box, and inside found a little note, scribbled in 
common:
 
Jafrod Bensson, resident of Smith's Alley. Thank you for allowing me the use of your 
home, and be aware that I will visit frequently until construction on my new premises 
is complete. You see, your house used to be the entrance to my headquarters. The 
knights will be back once the word gets out about my return.
 
My recommendation is that you destroy the box and this note, unless you just 
happen to like dungeons.
 
--NS

Subject An Introduction - Part I~
Text
It was late in the evening, dusk beginning to settle upon the countryside.
The caravan had been traveling through the mountains for several days, and were
now setting up camp in the plains of Throt. This caravan's cargo was not legal
in much of this part of the world - slaves. Six wagons full of them, scraped up
from all over the nations of the East.
 
"2 more days, and we get paid" grinned the armored man known to the rest as
'Marvok'.
 
"Aye, we got a good herd this time around" his colleague responded.
 
They stood near Marvok's tent, admiring the size of the hog they had slaughtered
earlier and was now spinning on a pit over the bonfire.
 
"So.. what did the healer say about Pryk?" Marvok's tone suggested the answer
would mean little to him.
 
"Well.. he'll be capable to join our next raid, but he likely won't be fathering
any children if he lives long enough to retire."
 
Marvok smirked and chuckled. "I warned him about those gypsies."
 
On the other side of the camp, a young woman lay slumped against the bars of her
wagon-cage, her eyes affixed on the grotesque site just outside of it. She was
covered in filth, and tear trails were clearly visible in the dirt on her
cheeks. She shook her head as she thought about the events that transpired
earlier that week.
 
"The least they could do is cut him loose and let the beasts have him.." a weary
man next to her said, his gaze also on the same sight.
 
"I didn't even know him." her reply was firm and cold.
 
Outside their bars, the mangled corpse that once was a man hung from the next
wagon in the caravan, stapled to the car by the longsword that was shoved
through his torso and deep into the wooden side of the car. His clothes had
been stripped off and various digits and members cut off.
 
"I know young one, but he did it because it was right. Though we all may be
strangers, that there was a good man. We mustn't forget that there still is
good in this world."
 
"There is no goodness in this world, only kindness and hatred, and all men are
equally capable of both" she drew her legs up into her arms and tucked her chin
in between her knees. "Soon we'll be sold to men who are probably more inclined
to the latter."
 
The man frowned. He had no reply to that, he could only pity the young woman.
 
Her name was Ila. Though she was very young, she had spent many years roaming
the wilderness with a band of gypsies. She nor those she traveled with knew the
fate of her parents, whom she hadn't seen as long as she could remember.
 
She saw the markings on top of her left hand and pulled her ragged sleeve over
it. As she gazed at the corpse her mind flashed back to the moments before his
final fate. Her gypsy band had come under attack by these bandits, most of her
friends and guardians murdered in cold blood, when they took her. He was a man
of above average height, and very well muscled. His clothing suggested he kept
similar company to her, perhaps another group of gypsies.
 
She was locked in a wagon with only him, as they had not finished capturing
new slaves to fill it out. That's when HE showed up. Pryk was a heavily scarred,
ugly man. His brown beard filled with bits of uneaten food. He wore leathern
armor, and it was heavily cracked, filthy, and smelled almost as bad as his
acrid breath. He threw open the cage door and grabbed her. She screamed and
protested, but he dragged her off to his tent, while several men around the
camp chuckled.
 
Pryk in his haste had forgotten to close and lock the cage, however. As he
removed his belt and began stripping off his leggings, the muscled man rushed
in from behind him, tackling him to Ila's side.
 
"RUN" he shouted at Ila, as he and Pryk began to scuffle. Ila scrambled out of
there, but was intercepted briefly after somewhere outside the tent. Pryk and 
Ila's savior continued to scuffle and as one of the other captors arrived to 
subdue the conflict, Pryk was clearly wounded by his own blade in his lower 
regions. The other man quickly executed the slave with a single slug to the head
from his mace. His body was dismembered and displayed in front of Ila's wagon as
a reminder of what was in store if one were to cross her captors. She never even
knew his name.
 
Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks as she relived the moment in her head again.
"I've got to escape" her resolve steel.
 
The man next to her gaped at her. "You couldn't make it away when the cage was
open, what makes you think you can get away now that they're expecting it?"
 
"Because I have to.. for him, for my friends. And one day, I'll visit Pryk and
Marvok when they *aren't* expecting me. That is the day, when they learn the
hatred they've taught me."

{gThe dim rays of Solinari broke on the horizon when the wagons were hitched up
and began to roll. Ila sat there in her cage, her arms crossed, a look of defeat
upon her face. A mercenary walking along side of the wagon smirked at the sight.
A dirty smirk it was, for he was missing most of his teeth and covered in what
could only be described as shit. These mercenaries were anything but clean. His
armor was cracked, and the hand-axe he carried was as dull as a river rock.
 
Ila smiled, thinking what role the fool outside of her wagon must play in the
mercenary band that had captured her. Cook perhaps? Or maybe he was in charge
of the asses and horses. He clearly wasn't equipped or built for battle.
Whatever his purpose, she was sure he'd be her ticket out of this terrible
predicament.
 
{w'What are you grinning at, filthy rat?'{g she spoke to the ugly man.
 
{w'Now what was dat you stupid bitch?'{g He shook his ineffective weapon at her. {w'I
ought to come in there and teach you a lesson!'{g
 
Ila leaned over, keeping her arms crossed, her shackles pulling forward with her
and spit through the bars right in the pig's face.
 
Disgusted the man pulled back, and jumped on the back of the wagon. Unbolting it
and opening the gate as it slowly rolled forward.
 
{w'Not very smart are you? What, being chained up and irritatin' a big strong man?
You'll pay for that now!'{g he climbed in to the cart.
 
It didn't matter, Ila uncrossed her arms, revealing her restraints having been
picked open. She plowed right into the disgusting creature's nose with a right
cross that destroyed the cartilage in his nose. He squealed and attempted to
shout, but Ila wrapped her chains around his neck and cut off his breath. He
immediately began thrashing about, and his left hand went to a knife tucked into
his belt. The old man in Ila's cage quickly pulled against his chains and was
able to reach the mercenary's hand. He continued gurgling and struggling, but
as Ila and her elderly friend in the cage subdued him, his thrashing eventually
stopped.
 
Ila moved over to the old man's chains, but he put his hand up.
 
{w'No young one, you should go before anyone notices.'
 
{gShe frowned at him. She then moved to the corpse and dragged him to the other
end of the cart, closing the door without its bolt, and assuming her position
again crossing her arms. A moment later a horse from the rear of the caravan
with another mercenary astride it came up. Its rider looked from side to side,
{w'Ah, where the hell is that Chum now?'{g He briefly peered into Ila's cage, but
sped up to the next cart. The old man looked at her.
 
{w'Go, now!'{g he said to her in a harsh whisper.
 
Ila took the knife from the recently deceased, nodded to her friend, and jumped
out of the cart, landing quietly, and quickly darting away into a copse of trees
next to the road. Only a few moments passed before she heard the shouting behind
her. She had to make her move quickly.
 
{w'Secure the slaves!'{g Marvok shouted to his men, and motioned to two other riders,
{w'You two, find the escapee, she couldn't have gone far.'{g
 
Ila shimmied up a tree so quietly, you'd have thought she were an elf. The loud
hoofing of a horse approaching signaled one rider's arrival. Then she heard the
deathcry of the old man come from the caravan. They must have discovered Chum's
fate. The rider and horse came past her tree. Ila released her grasp and pushed
against the bow with her legs, springing on to the back of the horse. The 
surprised rider attempted to hit her with his armored elbow, but she was quick.
Deftly she brought Chum's knife up and slipped it right under the back plate of
his armor, right between the back of his ribs. He tensed up, getting ready for 
another counter attack, but she twisted the knife, eliciting only a gurgle.
 
She shoved the barely-conscious man off the back of the horse, and quickly
brought the creature to a gallop. She had made it, but at the cost of how many
lives? She didn't have time to reflect on that now, she would mourn the loss of
her friends, the two men who died protecting her in the caravan, later. Now, now
comes the hard part.
 
Marvok backhanded the second rider off his horse when he returned.
 
{w'Enough of this, we have to get the rest of these dogs to the buyers, we'll
have to hunt that sneak down afterwards.'{g
 
He grumbled as he trotted his horse back up to point on the caravan. He was now
short one pretty girl for that special order in Lemish.{x

Amelia is in her right mind, at least, according to her.  Most times she is in her own little world, sometimes appearing outgoing and exuberant, other times seeming quite withdrawn and relatively hostile.  But what has gotten into her today?  Is she deliberately trying to cause chaos?  Or is she simply being a little adventurous?
 
After visiting several places, and slipping the right being or two a bit of coin, she let out a cackle of laughter before proceeding to hand out swords to little boys and girls in Palanthas, before trying to teach them to defend themselves!  She was also seen raiding the graveyard, killing the poor widows simply to take their flowers.  These were seen being given to the Hobgoblins! 
 
Someone should really stop this girl before every child is equipped full set of armor and the hobgoblins are seen singing while planting colorful flowers!

she has no want or need to be a Knight herself. Not that they would let her
if she wanted to. {yOut of respect she was going to attend{x, she told herself.
She, like so many, talked freely just before the Temple, guarded by them.
 
She takes her place a small distance away, near a broken gravestone and looks
on. A few Knights of the Crown are here. Their armor highly polished and
gleaming in a "high and mighty" sort of way. Two other women, who she can only
assume are the wives of the murdered Knights, both with children.
 
She wrinkles her brow slightly, trying to dig deep for an emotion that could
possibly match the anguish they're feeling. Unable to find the correct one, she
stops trying, and instead scans the rest of the funeral. Demetrius and two
others are here, one of the them a Knight as well. She has seen the Knight
before, but cannot remember if they've ever been properly introduced. The other
person.. ehh. It'll come to her if and when they speak, if they've met.
 
{yHow boring{x, she thinks, and instead loses herself in some other thoughts..
Traveling with her Mother from town to town, people being so skeptical of the
two of them.. Loud screaming brings her back to the present, only to see that
one of the wives have lost it. Screaming at the two Knights, blaming them for
what happened. Oh how it has become interesting again.
 
{R'You killed him!'{x one of the wives yelled as she fell down and started to
beat her dead husbands armor, sobbing almost uncontrollably. Screaming at the
Knights, blaming them for what happened. In vain, both Knights tried so
desperately to calm her down. Demetrius had given her a sack of coins. This
isn't going to fair very well for him, and she was right. The wife was even
more irate and angry. The other Knight seemed to be handling the situation a
little better, but only just.
 
A twinge of sadness crept over herself. Slowly, she walked over to the wife who
had finally begun to calm down, {w'The pain will never go away. All you can do
is remember him and try to live your life how he would have wanted you to. For
you and your child.'{x The woman smiled at her, even though she had started to
calm down by then, her smile was genuine.
 
Giving a slight bow with her head, she moved past the women, Knights, and
children. More than a little confused as to why she felt the need to comfort
the grieving woman. This was a first for her. Slipping her hand under her hood
she rubs her forehead a bit and talks to herself, {w'This place is not what I
expected.'{x Almost completely forgetting that a Necromancer had caused a scene
before anything had gotten started. Shrugging to herself, she made her way
slowly towards the Temple, not really paying attention along the way.

{gHow funny she thought.. she wanted so badly to be out in the fresh air and now she was taking a potion to take her right back home. Of all the moments she had to go into labor, it had to be now. Just one more day is all she needed.
 
Slowly she made her way up the long winding staircase of Urione. Stopping every now and then to deal with the pain. About half way up two nuns came to her aid. Discretely letting staff know it was time and to keep calm as they helped her up to the bedroom.
 
{w'Funny I should find you here.'{g she said to her hooded Mage friend.
 
{w'I told you, you shouldn't have left Ila. I could have managed by myself.'{g
 
{w'Oh be quiet and make yourself useful if you're going to stay. Now isn't the time I want hear that crap.'{g Ila said through a rather painful contraction.
 
{w'I come bearing a gift.. She's already waiting in your room. I know she's not the one you would have hoped to deliver your child..'{g Olana said.
 
The bedroom never looked so comforting right now, even with more people in it than she would like. Sitting down at the foot of the bed, Ila was helped out of her shoes and other unnecessary things, she instinctively grabbed at the hand trying to undo her weapon sheathe.
 
{w'No. I'll take them off.'{g Ila said calmly to the young girl. Realizing she had scared her a bit, she squeezed her hand gently, {w'Where is he? Do you know?'{g The girl gave her hand a gentle squeeze back and shook her head slowly.
 
The next hours were a mixture of slow and fast. People coming and going, yet Olana and her cleric friend stayed, sitting next to her. Exchanging stories keeping the air light, and even being oddly comforting when she was in pain. Olana was good at laying on the charm, and she was grateful for it at this moment.
 
{w'We can't wait anymore, you have to deliver soon.'{g Litai said calmly. {w'It's time.'{g
 
She shook her head stubbornly, taking in a deep breath. She could hear whispering and suddenly a calmness swept over her that she wasn't able to resist. She actually laughed out loud because she could almost hear Olana's eyes rolling with her loud sigh.
 
She knew she couldn't wait anymore, she closed her eyes and started to push. Olana and a nursemaid on either side of her, Litai talking to her and whispering softly from time to time. A large relief over came her as she suddenly heard a tiny little cry and opened her eyes, looking down.
 
{w'You have a son my Queen.'{g she heard a nun say excitedly, as he was taken away. She followed the nun with her eyes, trying to get another glimpse of her baby, but was snapped back into reality with the need to push again and Litai saying something to her.
 
{w'What?'{g she said annoyingly.
 
{w'You need to push again. You've been carrying two, not just one child your Highness.'{g
 
{w'I've WHAT?!'{g she said loudly. Olana grabbed her hand and leaned in close, whispering in her ear to push again. She inhaled deeply, the scent of violets and roses filling her nose and she pushed again. Just as she let out a loud cry of pain she felt calm again. Opening her eyes and staring up at the ceiling.
 
{w'A daughter. Oh my Goddess a daughter.'{g The same nun said, just as excitedly as before. Tears slowly streamed down her face as she lowered her head to look. Finally a very loud cry from her daughter, followed by one from her son. She squeezed both women's hands tightly and beamed a smile.
 
As the room calmed down with chattering and excitement, she was able to hold her children. Her son first, holding his tiny little hand as he squirmed around in her arms but didn't cry. Looking at every inch of his little wrinkled face, as he looked around blinking slowly, but constantly. He seemed to wear himself out and fell asleep.
 
As she put him in the bassinet her daughter was brought to her. A loud cry started to emanate from her tiny little lungs as she was finally passed to her. After a few moments, silence, her little tummy being sated. Resting her head back on the pillows behind her, she let out a sigh and spoke to the room.
 
{w'He missed it.. he wanted to be here so badly, holding my hand.. Why can't they make a spell for that?'{g
 
{w'I guess you'll just have to try for another and make sure you chain him to the chair won't you?'{g Olana spoke with a chuckle.
 
Ila couldn't help but laugh, {w'Oh shut up and go home.. and no you can't borrow any of my things.'{g
 
{w'I'm hurt you think I would ask.'{g
 
She smiled and closed her eyes, {w'I know you better than that. I swear sometimes you're part Kender. Besides, Shinzo will be here soon, you don't need to explain what happened. I think it's fairly obvious.'{g
 
She heard the door open and close softly as Olana left. She opened her eyes and looked down at her daughter and then to her son and smiled happily.{x
