calling after nearly losing his entire family to plague.  Rather than
abandon the Conclave entirely, he has chosen instead to remain with his
brethren and put his abilities to use for the benefit of all who reside in
the Tower.

to take great pleasure in the sounds of arcane battle emanating from the

chamber against unlawful use.  Also responsible for maintaining the wards
that keep the magics within from escaping, he is careful to ensure that only
two combatants enter at any given time.

The Master Alchemist having gone on a research expedition, this young
Apprentice has landed the unfortunate task of overseeing the laboratories in
his master's absence.  The original color of his robes is no longer
apparent; having been stained and spotted with all manner of chemicals and
components.  Sighing wearily, he sorts through a number of scattered piles
around his feet in an attempt to record inventory.

the Instructor~
A {RRed Robed{x Instructor is here to assist you with your learning.
~
This jolly-looking man looks to be in his mid-thirties; relatively young
for an Instructor, yet his eyes sparkle with a quick wit.  As tall as a
plainsman and heavy of frame, some of the more irreverent students
affectionately refer to him as "goblin-gut".  A bard by trade before coming
to study at the tower, his gift for storytelling is overshadowed only by his
capacity to remember detail.  Most of his time is spent here lecturing on
all manner of topics and lore, and every so often if the students beg him
long enough, he will raise his voice in songs that can be heard in the
courtyard.

Black velvet drapes hang from every wall, reflecting a cold light from a
number of large candles in iron sconces.  A carved four-poster bed sits
against the back wall next to a towering bookshelf overflowing with various
tomes.  An overstuffed couch lies against the south wall, with an equally
stuffed chair and polished writing desk near the hearth on the opposite
side.  Columns of polished ebony line the hearth to either side, supporting
a black marble mantle above the magical flame.  High above in the vaulted

An unnatural silence fills the air here.  No woodland creatures can be

every direction, row upon row of tall, majestic trees in full spring bloom
seem to whisper to one another.  Time quickly loses any meaning within this
magical woodland, and it becomes hard to tell whether one has been wandering
for hours or days.  Created long ago to ward off any unwelcome visitors, the

An unnatural silence fills the air here.  No woodland creatures can be
seen or heard, yet the air itself seems to hum with energy.  Stretching in
every direction, row upon row of tall, majestic trees in full spring bloom
seem to whisper to one another.  Time quickly loses any meaning within this
magical woodland, and it becomes hard to tell whether one has been wandering
for hours or days.  Created long ago to ward off any unwelcome visitors, the
Forest of Wayreth stands silent vigil over those foolhardy enough to seek
the Conclave uninvited.

Before the Unguarded Gates of Wayreth~
Gates of beaten gold stand here, as if suddenly risen from the forest
floor.  Closed and unguarded, they are framed by massive walls of polished
black stone.  A path beyond the gates leads into a barren courtyard paved
with grey flagstone.  Throughout the courtyard, wisps of black, red, and
white flutter past just at the edge of vision.  Beyond the stark grey
courtyard, a huge tower rises into the sky; its minarets seeming to reach
toward the heavens.

Beyond the Unguarded Gates of Wayreth~
To the south stand gates of beaten gold; delicately twisted strands of
railing resembling shining cobwebs.  Rising into the distance is the fabled
Tower of Wayreth - are those spires crooked?  Neither here nor there, wisps
of black, red, and white flutter about the edge of one's vision.  The ground
below is paved with gray flagstone that stretches out along the bottom of
the towering black walls, and to the north, toward the tower.  The courtyard
itself appears stark and bare; however, whispering words and bits of muffled
conversation emanate from unseen sources all around.

ominously before you, runes flaring brightly against the black surface of the
outer walls.  The spires themselves are bare, displaying neither battlements
nor guards to walk them.  Throughout the courtyard, wisps of black, red, and

fountain~
This fountain has been beautifully crafted.  The dwarven hands that
shaped it having taken great time and care.  Its three central spouts have
been fashioned into the likeness of humanoid figures.  One is an ancient
white robed wizard holding a delicate vase, with the name "Solinari"
inscribed under its feet.  The second is inscribed "Lunitari", and depicts a
beautiful woman in the robes of a mage pouring water from a barrel in her
hands.  The third and final figure is fashioned in the likeness of a wicked
looking young boy, holding a skull that spews water from its mouth; the
inscription at the child's feet reads: "Nuitari".

either side, the twin spires of the Tower itself seem to stretch endlessly

past, intent on their various tasks.

This atrium is lit with a soft glow borne by a number of floating candles
dispersed throughout the chamber.  To the east and west, expansive hallways
curve toward various classrooms and meeting chambers.  Boys and girls of all
ages mill past, their arms laden with textbooks and supplies.  Now and
again, a loud bang can be heard from the eastern hallway; various mages and
older students glancing toward the sound with a knowing chuckle.  A portrait
hangs on the wall just opposite the doors, while a vase of white roses rests
on a finely crafted endtable sitting directly below.

The Great Hall~
This vast chamber is reserved for official Conclave meetings.  A
cheerless white glow with no apparent source is the only light in the room,
the stark obsidian walls fading into the surrounding shadows.  The ceiling
itself is of such a height as to completely disappear into darkness above. 
In the center of the chamber, twenty-one stone chairs have been arranged
into a semicircle, seven for each Order.  Here, the High Council convenes to
conduct official Conclave business, hidden from any intrusion or prying
eyes.

The Dungeons~
The hallway is dark, cold, and damp.  A very cold blue light sulks around
the walls, casting ominous shadows against the ground.  The walls of the
dungeons have been blackened and are nearly impossible to see.  Hollow moans
come from within the cells of the dungeon.  A well-concealed door to the
west is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding wall, leading into the
Testing chambers.

A Holding Cell~
This holding cell is small and reeks of urine.  Moldy straw lies across
the floor and chains clang gently against the black walls.  Bones clutter
one corner of the cell as stains of some sort cover the other.  All in all,
this cell is not a good place to be.

The Testing Arena~
This chamber is huge, its walls and ceiling obscured by shadow.  A small
pool of light gathers in the center of the room; waiting for the next brave
applicant to risk life, limb, and sanity in the attempt to enter into the
ranks of High Sorcery.  Here, aspiring mages are confronted with all manner
of trials; mental, physical, and arcane, in order to prove their worthiness
to stand among their fellows in service to their Art.

A Holding Cell~
This cell is cramped and dirty, and reeks of rotting carrion.  Insects
buzz here and there through cracks in the stone as an icy breeze sweeps
through, making a hollow moaning sound.  Against one wall, a bleached
skeleton hangs from a torture rack, its empty eye sockets staring hollowly as
it seems to grin at you.

A Well Lit Hallway in the Tower~
The western hall is much like its eastern cousin.  Barren stone walls
sweep uninterrupted down the corridor, adorned here and there with portraits
of past Tower residents.  Students of various races and ages sweep up and
down the corridor, moving this way and that with their arms full of all
sorts of items.

The eastern corridor stretches deeper into the tower, its castle like

the ambient glow seems to radiate from the walls themselves.  Scattered
along the passage, portraits of famous mages both past and present hang in
silent vigil.

The intersection here stretches in each direction.  The black stone walls
are polished to perfection.  A stout wooden door is set into a runed archway
to the north; leading to the "Dueling Chamber", wherein mages may practice
offensive spells and countermagic with one another, and those of the Black
Robes determine the Heads of their Order.  To the west lie the central
towers dedicated to each Order, while to the east, the corridor branches
toward the Alchemy wing.

This intersection stretches in all directions.  Unlike most of the Tower,
the walls here are not polished.  Instead, the hallway is covered in a fine
layer of soot; carried by oily black smoke that occasionally seeps down the
stairs from the Alchemist's Wing to the east.  To the west, the corridor
leads to individual spires for the three Orders.  The northern passage leads
to the study of Archmage Antimodes.

The bottom of the stairwell to the Alchemist's Wing is covered in black

lewd comments on the wall.  Numerous footprints track soot along the

The fumes in this room are almost too much for your senses to bear!  All
about the laboratories, young mages bustle about, concocting strange brews
for any occasion.  The atmosphere is a bit unnerving, as several apprentices
with odd stains on their robes and singed eyebrows are shown to the
infirmary (and the occasional explosion from the Head Alchemist's office
does not do much to reassure you).  A sign has been tacked to the far wall.

The Study of Antimodes~
This study could best be described as a perpetual state of "organized
chaos".  A magical globe rotates slowly on its axis in one corner,
displaying the current geography of Krynn.  A small, but cheery fire burns
merrily in a hearth set into the west wall; a portrait hanging above the
mantle.  The southern wall is dominated by a series of large bookshelves
that run the entire length of this expansive chamber.  The northern wall is
dominated by even more books, while the eastern side of the room holds
countless scroll racks.  A massive desk sits in the center of the chamber,
piled high with an assortment of books and papers that seem to adhere to its
surface like iron shavings to a magnet.

The Dueling Chamber~
This bare room has come to be known as the "dueling chamber".  While
actual dueling among mages within the Tower is strictly forbidden, this
room is used for fellow mages to test their skills together and learn from
one another.  The popular term for the former "practice arena" was coined
due to the custom of the Black Robes to use it as a place to determine the
leaders of their Order by trial of combat.  A series of glowing runes have
been placed around the archway leading to and from the chamber.

An Intersection between the Towers~
The hallway opens here into an immense intersection, the ceiling lost
from sight.  A number of floating orbs light the area, illuminating the form
of three massive stairwells, each colored to represent its respective Order.
To the east lies a set of arcing marble stairs, while to the west, a spiral
of iron winds its way deeper into the upper towers.  The northern stairwell
serves as a centerpiece of sorts; its wooden double staircase covered in
luxurious carpet from Southern Ergoth.  Mages from all Orders nod in
greeting to one another as they go about their daily business, while a group
of students makes their way toward the Tower Library further to the north.

The stairwell to the east has been beautifully shaped from the purest
white marble and wraps around itself in a graceful spiral.  The banisters
have been crafted of ivory, and inlaid with flecks of gold and platinum.
The marble post at the bottom of the landing has been fashioned into the
likeness of an {Wold{x man.
~
E
iron~
The stairwell to the west has been fashioned from wrought-iron; its
twisting railings resembling intertwining serpents.  The steps are cold and
bare, and seem to radiate a noticeable chill compared to the surrounding
temperature.  At the bottom of the landing, a cast iron statue of a
{Dyoung{x man stands as if in silent warning.

The northern stairwell has been fashioned from highly polished
cherrywood, lending it an almost petrified appearance.  The stairs
themselves spiral upward in a delicate helix shape, and are covered in a
deep scarlet carpet studded with brass to keep it in place.  The bottom
banister has been carved into the likeness of a {Ryouthful{x looking woman.
~
E
woman~
This carved statue depicts a beautiful young woman in flowing robes.  The
wood has been stained in such a fashion as to give her hair a reddish tint. 
Her capricious smile and the mischievous glint in her eyes seems to hint at
a good-natured cunning intelligence, and in her hands she holds a large
ruby.  
~
E
statue~
This cast iron statue has been shaped into the form of a studious looking
young man.  His short hair is slicked back, and his face is devoid of any
expression; save for his eyes, which seem to burn with a dark intensity.  
~
E
post~
This statue depicts an ancient wizard with a kindly face.  Its eyes
appear bright and lucid, filled with the wisdom of countless years, yet the
smile he wears is cryptic; as if he knew a secret that the rest of the world
did not.

{WAt the Bottom of a Marble Staircase{x~
This wide, arcing stairwell has been beautifully shaped from the purest
white marble and wraps around itself in a graceful spiral.  The banisters
have been crafted of ivory, and inlaid with flecks of gold and platinum. 
The marble post at the bottom of the landing has been fashioned into the
likeness of an old man.  A small landing can be seen farther up the
stairway, while to the west lies the main floor of the Tower.

This stairwell has been fashioned from highly polished cherrywood,
lending it an almost petrified appearance.  The stairs themselves spiral
upward in a delicate helix shape, and are covered in a deep scarlet carpet
studded with brass to keep it in place.  The bottom banister has been
carved into the likeness of a youthful looking woman.

This carved statue depicts a beautiful young woman in flowing robes.  The
wood has been stained in such a fashion as to give her hair a reddish tint. 
Her capricious smile and the mischievous glint in her eyes seems to hint at
a good-natured cunning intelligence, and in her hands she holds a large
ruby.

The Great Library~
Currently the greatest repository for magical learning on the face of
Krynn, the Library of Wayreth is a massive circular chamber containing
spellbooks and scrolls of every color, from every region and Age throughout
history.  A large hearth rests along the east wall surrounded by several
large cushioned chairs.  A series of long semicircular tables are arranged
throughout the area for study and discussion of magical theory.  The
northern, western, and southern walls are obscured entirely by shelves.  A
life-size portrait rests above the hearth.

portrait~
A beautiful woman stands here, the epitome of youthful elegance.  Her
strawberry-blonde hair falls straight to her shoulders, and her pure white
robes are cut in a design more reminiscent of a lady's gown than of a
typical mage's.  While her face is youthful, her eyes are those of an older
woman who has seen more of the world than she would care to.  There is a
business-like quality to her expression, tempered with a sense of hope and
compassion deep within her gaze.  Mounted beneath the portrait is a polished

Within Wayreth Forest~
An unnatural silence fills the air here.  No woodland creatures can be
seen or heard, yet the air itself seems to hum with energy.  Stretching in
every direction, row upon row of tall, majestic trees in full spring bloom
seem to whisper to one another.  Time quickly loses any meaning within this
magical woodland, and it becomes hard to tell whether one has been wandering
for hours or days.  Created long ago to ward off any unwelcome visitors, the
Forest of Wayreth stands silent vigil over those foolhardy enough to seek
the Conclave uninvited.

Polished brass sconces illuminate the area and sparkle from crystalline

light from several oil lamps reflecting in the draped window behind it. 
Large bookshelves line the surrounding walls, and historical records and

them.  Thick, red drapes decorate the empty walls between the bookshelves,
of which there are few.  Along one wall sits a table piled with strange,

Here the trees have grown so thick as to be impassable; almost as if they
were closing ranks.  An unnatural silence fills the air; no woodland
creatures can be seen or heard, yet the air itself seems to hum with energy.
In every direction, the eerily imposing trees seem to whisper to one
another.  Time quickly loses any meaning within this magical woodland, and
it becomes hard to tell whether one has been wandering for hours or days. 
There is little choice but to return the way you came.

Rising above the forest below, the top of the Red Tower is open and
flawless.  Having been crafted out of the same wood and brass that the rest
of this tower has been crafted from, it appears magnificent against the rest
of the surrounding spaces.  The wood here has been flecked with gold, giving
it a very beautiful shimmer when the sun decides to rise from its slumber. 
A feeling of intense tranquility radiates around the area, easing the
burdens of every day life.
