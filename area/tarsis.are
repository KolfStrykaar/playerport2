dark shadow thief~
A dark shadowy thief~
A dark shadowy thief is hidden within the dark recesses of the room.
~
A dark, sinewy looking man slithers within the shadowy recesses of the
cavern; a large, billowing cloak obscuring most of his body.  His hood is
drawn up tightly about his face, causing it to be quite difficult to judge
his race.  His hands are long and slender, human in appearance.  A dark and
eerie presence forms around him causing some to possibly feel quite
threatened.

defined with small pouty lips.

This peacekeeper is clad in armor depicting Tarsis' insignia.  He is tall
in regards to many elven kinds, seemingly having a human mix in him.  A
small helmet hides most of his head, though two small, yet sharply defined
stick out on each side.  His eyes are constantly moving as he makes his way
through the city streets.

a robust merchant~
A robust merchant walks along, swinging his money pouch.
~
This robust elderly man seems quite content to whistle to himself as he
walks through the city.  His money pouch bulging from his side, a greedy
expression is evident in his eyes.  His bald head gleams brightly, and his
nose is large and slightly reddened; showing signs of heavy drinking.  His
watery blue eyes shift now and again as he passes a shop or someone with
interesting items.

large woman shopkeeper~
the large woman~
A very large woman is squeezed tightly behind the counter in the back.
~
This woman is by far large, and this would be an understatement.  She
glows with a translucency, most likely so she hasn't to worry about getting
around objects instead she simply walks through them.  Her hair is long,
rolled up into a tight bun at the top of her head.  Her eyes are large and
full of mirth that twinkle with a fair amount of mischief.  She grins to
those that enter her establishment giving a bit of a wink.  She holds in her
hand a long wooden phallus that hums with a strange magic causing the woman
to laugh loudly.

A blacksmith is in the corner tending to a piece of equipment.

This old man is black as coal; not by birth, but rather from soot that
seems to be at least two inches thick.  His black hair is long, pulled back
tightly with a piece of leather.  A few streaks of dirty gray run
sporadically throughout his hair.  His face is long, showing his years in
deep creases that litter his skin.  He is dressed in well-worn garb that is
obviously his work clothes.  He looks up greeting you with a smile.

Talina is a short yet slender woman.  Her long black hair lays in wave
after wave of tight curls that bounce joyously with every movement made. 
Upon her neck, if her hair moves out of the way just right, a mark can be
seen depicting a merchants guild.  Her clothes are extravagent to say the
least.  First is a simple black shift that is trimmed in a bright red lace. 
Covering the shift is a long yellow satin cloak.  Her feet are clad in soft
knee high boots with silk ribbons for laces.  She lifts her head from the
cauldron as you enter, a warm smile greeting you as she stops what she's
doing to help you with your shopping.

feathers are bright and seem to hold a magical aura within them.  She has
high cheek bones, a finely sculpted nose, and soft yet supple lips.  Her
eyes, however, show hatred and vengance within them.

Her bright gold eyes hold a strange glow; glinting with a life of their own,
they are framed in luscious silver lashes.  Her eyebrows are naturally
shaped to give the woman's face an even more feminine appearance.  Her
cheekbones are flushed with a light blush, as are her soft round lips.  Her
hair falls in a cascade of silver that the sun seems to have streaked with
white strands.  It falls short at the small of her back, waving gently as if
stirred by the wind.  She stands approximately five foot seven inches and
holds a gracefulness about her.

lightly about her face in many curly locks.  Her bright aqua eyes are masked
in thick black lashes.  Her nose is straight and slightly turned up at the
end.  Her cheekbones sharply defined with the contours of her thin face. 
Her lips are naturally a dark red and seem to hold a pouty expression to
them.  Each ear is decorated in many piercings, usually depicting crossbones
or snakes.  Her neckline is covered in many layers of silver necklaces.  Her
shoulders are bony in appearance beneath layers of cloaks that hide her
almost anorexic appearance.  Her hands are thin, yet hold a graceful
appearance to them.  Over all, the woman looks to be one that does not do
well in a large crowd.

Southern City Wall~
On the far southern edge of Tarsis lies the prominent southern wall. 
Composed of interlocking gray cobblestones, this street was built to allow
the passage of many down its wide path.  The sounds of the city echo about
as travelers and citizens alike make their way through to different
destinations.  A high wall of granite runs along the side of the road
creating a barrier of sorts from the outside world.  Large lanterns have
been placed along the side of the street as well to be lit as the sun sinks
below the horizon and night falls.  Plots of grass, small flowers and
ornamental trees have been planted along side the sawmill wall in hopes to
add color to the area.  Buildings made from gray stone line up and down the
southern wall, composing both shops and homes for the cities populace.

Southern Gate~
A dusty cobblestone courtyard surrounded by short dunes stands before a
sturdy wooden gate.  Several paths, leading into the desert plains, can be
seen following the natural contours of the land.  Guards walk the walls,
their spears glinting as they pace the wall's paths.  A pair of guards stand
in the shade of the gate's structure, watching all who approach with
interest.  The traffic coming through the gate is light and the guards seem
bored.  Scents of the city's merchant district and other less savory smells
waft on the hot breeze which blows lightly from the north.  The desert
stretches to the south, its sandy sun-bleached dunes stretching up to meet
the sky.

Main Street~
The city's main street has been paved with gray cobblestones that are now
well worn with the passage of time.  Despite their age they have been kept
cleanly swept and well repaired.  The different sounds of the city seem to

A wooden plank creaks, crackles and pops as one would walk across it. 
There is a layer of sand coating the wood giving it a grainy shuffling sound.
A handrail is placed on each side, worn down by time and lack of upkeep.  If
one were to lean just right upon it the odds would be good they would fall
to the bottomless sandpit below.  A large sign hangs precariously at the end

as travelers and citizens alike make their way through to different
destinations.  A high wall of granite runs along the side of the road
creating a barrier of sorts from the once sparkling blue waters of the sea. 
Large lanterns have been placed along the side of the street as well to be
lit as the sun sinks below the horizon and night falls.  Plots of grass,
small flowers and ornamental trees have been planted along side the sawmill
wall in hopes to add color to the area.  Buildings made from gray stone line
up and down the western wall, composing both shops and homes for the cities
populace.

Entrance to the Hall of Justice~
An ugly brick building has been built to represent the Hall of Justice. 
It appears as though the workmanship may have once been grand, but after the
Cataclysm it has to be rebuilt or remodeled.  The hall leads to a plain
wooden door that opens up into a small antechamber.  A tinker lies in the
corner, snoring noisily, having obviously drunk too much wine.

The Entrance to the Library~
Dust hangs in the air as the contents of the room are disturbed.  Broken
furniture and bits of debris litter the center of the room, the smell of
decay exuding from its depths.  Skeletal feet clad in rotted leather sandals
jut from the eastern edge of the pile and a skeletal hand, grasping a
fire-scorched book, lies at its northern edge.  Dark hallways stretch to the
east and west, while more debris nearly blocks the way south.  A slight
breeze whistles from the road, ruffling the singed cloth hanging from the
exposed and charred rafters.

A Deserted Road~
Overgrown with tall grasses and shrubs, the old cart path still has
notable ruts from heavy use.  A dead tree stands silent vigil at the
entrance to a stone structure to the north.  The wind whistles as it rattles
the gaunt branches of the giant.  The scent of wood smoke is prevalent
though there is no sign of a house or campfire.  No sounds of insects,
birds, or other wildlife are audible.  Towards the south an old building
rises up against the skyline.

streets themselves are lined with many torches that are lit at night keeping
a bright and cheery feeling about the area.  Towards the north is Sea Cove
Road and to the south is a few shops.

Jariah's Armory~
This building has been made of huge, dark blocks of stone.  What light
there is mainly comes from the large bonfire in the massive fireplace.  The
flames glare brightly and send heat rolling out across the room in waves. 
Attached to the fireplace is a large set of bellows that fan the flames
below.  Upon the walls hang different types and styles of armor, brightened
and polished for display.  The armor smith is over at the anvil working on a
new suit of armor.

This store has been made from large, black blocks of stone.  What light
there is mainly comes from the massive fireplace against the far wall.  The
flames glare brightly and send heat rolling out across the room in waves. 
Adjoined to the fireplace is a large forge that billows heat and fans the
flames below.  Upon the walls hang different types and styles of weaponry,
brightened and polished for display they glimmer in the dim light.  The
weapon smith is over at the forge working with a piece of metal as he
hammers away at it.

Jeanine's Fine Clothing~
This shop is completely decked out with fine clothes made especially for
women.  As the door is opened, a small bell rings; allowing the shopkeeper
to come out from the back room to greet the customers.  The walls are lined
with many different styles of dresses.  Elaborate gowns meant for an evening
of dancing sit side by side along more exotic dresses quite obviously made
for ladies of the night.  In the center of the shop is a rack with shoes
dangling from it.  The smell of vanilla is quite strong within the store,
some are even capable of smelling it simply by passing by.

A Small Path Leading to a Garden~
A brightly-lit path leads south to the main garden.  The path is lined
with many beautiful flowers that seem to always be in bloom no matter the
weather or season.  Along the path, sconces have been placed along the wall;
to be lit at night, so that any may visit the garden no matter the time. 
The flowers give off a lovely scent that resembles jasmine when they are in
full bloom.  To the north, the noise from the marketplace can be heard
bustling day or night.

A Tranquil Garden~
The beautiful Gardens of Tarsis lie along the very southernmost part of
the market.  They have been lined with many different flowers, shrubs and
trees.  The lawns are immaculately kept plots of grass and decorative
vegetation.  A small dirt path winds through the garden and past a small
wooden bench and an ornamental pool surrounded by yellow tulips.  Small
birds fly to and fro over the flowers, their songs echoing throughout the
garden.  In the far south corner a small sapling is growing.  Its branches
are blooming with bright blue flowers that leave a lingering scent over the
garden.

Talina's Potions~
The air within the store literally crackles with raw energy and the sense
of electricity fills the room, causing hairs on the back of the arm to stand
up on end.  All about are different books, tomes and scrolls filling almost
every available corner.  The rest of the space is taken up by what appears
to be nothing more than large piles of junk.  A thick layer of dust lies
over everything, making it apparent nothing has been touched in ages. 
Through the dim light you can make out an elderly man standing in the back
near a clutter of sticks.  He is examining a wand carefully in his hands
with a magnifying glass.  Every now and then a spark will appear from the
tip and he will mutter something beneath his breath.

Gray walls have been erected on either side of the way, making Coral Street

Torches mounted in wall brackets light the Inn.  A strong built man
stands behind the counter, drying some kegs.  A couple of small tables are
randomly distributed throughout the room; around one, three dwarves and a
gnome sit playing dice and drinking ale.  The bartender glances up at each
new arrival, arching an eyebrow with disdain showing uneasiness with the
presence of strangers.  From time to time, a strange sound can be heard

Sea Cove Road is a bustling section of the city as it connects to the
market place that is to the south.  Composed of interlocking gray
cobblestones, this street was built to allow the passage of many down its
wide path.  The sounds of the city echo about as travelers and citizens
alike make their way through to different destinations.  A low wall of
granite runs along the side of the road for decoration purposes only.  Large
lanterns have been placed along the side of the street as well to be lit as
the sun sinks below the horizon and night falls.  Plots of grass, small
flowers and ornamental trees have been planted along side the small wall in
hopes to add color to the area.  There is a small sewer grate in the ground
that seems to have been lifted a bit in the corner.

bald-head can be seen popping up now and again above the stack.  A small
bell is resting on the edge of the desk precariously close to falling.  Off
towards the east, a beautiful fireplace can be seen giving off a tremendous
amount of warmth.  A wonderful smell wafts in from the south entrance, where
the kitchen helpers can be heard wandering about preparing different
varieties of food.  A spiral staircase twists and turns upwards towards the
rooms for rent.

of food most likely to be delivered to a room.  The cook herself is near the

A Brightly Lit Hall~
The brightly-lit hall leads to a few rooms within the inn.  The hall is
covered in pretty tapestries depicting different dragons in battle.  Instead
of torches magical lights hover near the ceiling giving off a beautiful glow
the lights the entire hall.  The floor is made of wood with a red carpet
running up the center of it.  The carpet itself is made of a rich plush

The small room is quaint in appearance.  A bed is lined against the far
wall.  Its covers are clean in appearance and neatly kept.  The floor is
covered in a thick carpet of red.  A vanity is opposite the bed and has an
array of items left here for the comfort of the occupants.  A chest sits at
the foot of the bed allowing those staying for a long period of time a place

The Suite~
The suite is much larger in comparison to the small quaint rooms.  A
large queen size bed with a beautiful sheer canopy has been placed against
the far wall.  The deep red sheets are made of silk and the comforter is
also in a deep red, trimmed in black satin.  There is a huge vanity opposite
the bed.  It holds a wide variety of new brushes, mirror, and combs for the
lady of the suite.  A sharp shaving razor and cream for the gentlemen are
also among the things on the vanity.  The red carpet is made of a plush
material, losing the occupants feet within it.

Entering through the plain wooden doors the antechamber is not the most
glorious of rooms to behold.  The walls are dungy and dirty with years of
grime.  The stench is unnamable, perhaps a mixture of many things.  Two
large double doors lead to the audience chambers where the Lord of Tarsis
conducts the hearings.  To the east and west are the guards rooms while back
to the south leads to the entrance to the Hall of Justice.

dangerous or who's crimes have not been heard by the Lord of Tarsis.  Back

The double doors open wide leading into the audience chambers where the
Lord of Tarsis conducts all the hearings.  The stench follows into this room
giving off pungent and old bitter smells.  Five counsel members are seated on
a bench upon a podium, three on either side of their Lord, who is seated,
himself, on a tall chair in the center.  Each council member has orange
spiced cloves placed in their nostrils to absolve them of having to smell
the stench.  The lighting within the chamber is minimal causing most to have
to adjust to the dimness of the chamber.  Behind the council members a plain
wooden door is closed.

lightening in here is next to none, one small torch on the wall keeps it
from sinking within darkness completely.  The only exit out of this room is

The holding chamber is a room that is cold and dreary.  A few men are
shackled to the wall awaiting the Lord of Tarsis to bring down his
sentencing.  The air in here reeks worse than the other rooms as the men
that are shackled are sweating profusely.  Along the eastern wall is a
holding cell for those prisoners who do not wish to behave themselves in a
proper manner as they await the Lord.  The lighting in here is minimal, no
windows lighting it during the day only a torch that is placed on the wall.

of filth.  The walls are grimy oozing from the cracks in the floor something

layer of broken shelves, fire-scorched and smashed with blows from a blunt
weapon.  A battered skeleton lies, soot covered in the center of the

hallway leads back to the Entrance to the Library and towards the west leads

books, its brown robe faded with age.  It seems to grin as if in victory, an
eternal guardian of its pile of tomes and scrolls.  Towards the east the
hallway leads to the entrance, yet to the south there seems to be a dark

The tunnel opens up to a large room yet seems to be a dead end.  The
ground has been packed hard as if it once had been used as a storage room. 
There are imprints upon the ground where obvious boxes had been.  The
ceilings can hardly be seen, being so high the darkness swallows what might
be above.  If one were to travel further into the room they would find a
skeleton that has been shoved into the furthest corner, hidden within the
dark shadows.

Barely visible in the darkest corner of the library is a badly burnt
corpse, clutching a large tome which is largely undamaged.  Dark soot clings
to all surfaces of the walls and ceiling.  The stench of burnt flesh and
death pervade the corner.  The air seems heavy and oppressive within this
section of the library.  A sliver of a light cuts through the thick darkness
towards the east.

A Large Ante Chamber~
Entering this room one is able to stand up without even coming close to
reaching the ceiling.  The large dome-like ceiling is covered in soot and
cobwebs.  There is skeletal figures embedded within the walls as if from
some type of an explosion.  Tattered red tapestry is strewn here and there
covering many bookshelves.  One large bookshelf looms up on the southern
wall, covered with many books.  Near the bookshelf there appears a guardian
of the library protecting all that is within this old chamber.  As any
approaches the guardian begins to howl in warning.

A Plank Leading to The Thistle~
A wooden plank creaks, crackles and pops as one would walk across it. 
There is a lair of sand coating the wood giving it a grainy shuffling sound.
A handrail is placed on each side, worn down by time and lack of upkeep.  If
one were to lean just right upon it the odds would be good they would fall
to the bottomless sandpit below.  A large sign hangs precariously at the end
of the plank.

Upon the Deck of The Thistle~
On the deck of the ship called Thistle, time and sand rot the entire
floor of the deck.  Looking up one would see masts that are worn and
tattered through time.  An eerie presence seems to surround the ship giving
it an ominous feeling.  Looking out over the railing one can see for miles
upon miles of sand that was once massive water that rocked this ship once
upon a time.  The deck stretches in all directions.

The Captains Quarters~
Once one of the most exquisite and well-decorated rooms of the Thistle,
the captains lounge is now completely decayed and destroyed.  The furniture
made of fine elven wood and with descriptive patters of leaves and unicorns
still stands although the passing of time has tainted and corrodes these
high quality pieces.  Also in the same style a bed, for two stands on the
right side of the room by the wall.  The carpets, courting and all other
garments are old, dusty and pierced.  Some book lays on the ground and a
silver chandelier hangs from the ceiling.

that are still burning cast a flickering light across the room giving the
impression the floor shifting beneath those that attempt to travel through
such darkness.  Dark shadows play in the light, or perhaps it's a shadowy
figure that is darting in between the flickering light.  Cobwebs cover the
top of the dirt ceilings, causing some to entangle within the hair of those

The shabby room has a long, dirty bar centered within the middle of the
room.  A large obese man stands behind the bar cleaning dirty glasses.  His
eyes usually are trained on the next room where men and women alike sit in
shadows exploring the darkness with each other.  Obvious moans and grunts
can be heard coming from within the common room.  The bartender gets a
devilish grin every time one of the waitresses come up to order a drink.  To
the west one could see a very large woman behind a counter playing with
strangely shaped devices.

The fact this room is quite small by nature makes it worse seeing the
huge woman behind the counter.  Her obese frame makes the makeshift shop
look even smaller in appearance.  There are a few shelves as well as the
main counter in the middle of the room.  Upon the shelves and counters there
are a few strangely shaped devices one would normally either be quite
confused by their appearance, or blush for the boldness of their shape.  Big
mama greets every customer with a friendly wave as well as a wink, being it
male or female.

This room has many candles placed around various tables.  They are set
just so that they cast shadows just so over the many couches and chairs. 
This in turn gives the occupants of the furniture some privacy to do as they
please.  The noise coming from the southern corridor is obvious in nature as
the moans and grunts of men and women echo in and around the room.

center of the room though the shadow blends well with the rest of the
shadows.  Small-unseen objects litter the floor causing an eerie scraping
noise as one might move about the room.  The walls seem to be rough in
nature though one would only be able to realize such by touch unless they
were able to see within the darkness.  The only obvious exit is back towards

A broad archway, who's upper ridge bristles with its spike-covered

water.  Now types of sand craft and oddly designed wagons fill spots where
sloops and Barques used to float.  Guards wander back and forth, inspecting
imports and collecting the governor's duties and taxes.  A steady stream of
merchants and travelers is seen entering the port city's gate, each burdened
with its own unique wares.  A hot wind blows from the north, causing the
banners on the gate to rise and fall in a regular rhythm.  'The main part of
the city lies to the east', A merchant tells his crew, directing their
movements like a conductor would an orchestra.

the city.  There are torch brackets at 5ft-interval along the walls, and
those that are still burning cast a flickering light across the room giving
the impression the floor shifting beneath those that attempt to travel through
such darkness.  Dark shadows play in the light, or perhaps it's a shadowy
figure that is darting in between the flickering light.  Cobwebs cover the
top of the dirt ceilings, causing some to entangle within the hair of those
not careful.

The Sand Dunes~
Sand dunes rise every which way and stretch out to the horizon in this
area.  The yellowed substance seems the only thing that fills every inch of
the realm.  The desert has ravaged the road, apparently made years ago. 
Brutal winds and a mixture of sand have eroded each stone.  The air is dry
causing many to become quite parched as they travel through the area.  Small
dust devils swirl about a few tumbleweeds float by as well.

Along the Sea Wall~
On the far western edge of Tarsis lies the prominent sea-wall.  Composed
of interlocking gray cobblestones, this street was built to allow the
passage of many down its wide path.  The sounds of the city echo about as
travelers and citizens alike make their way through to different
destinations.  A high wall of granite runs along the side of the road
creating a barrier of sorts from the once sparkling blue waters of the sear.
Large lanterns have been placed along the side of the street as well to be
lit as the sun sinks below the horizon and night falls.  Plots of grass,
small flowers and ornamental trees have been planted along side the sawmill
wall in hopes to add color to the area.  Buildings made from gray stone line
up and down the western wall, composing both shops and homes for the cities
populace.

Road to Tarsis~
The dusty road is covered in small dust devils as the winds pick up
causing them to swirl about the area.  The ground is dusty, full of pebbles
and odd shaped stones that have been crushed and stomped upon.  A few desert
critters can be seen scrambling through the dry and crackling underbrush
upon anyone's sudden movement down the road.  The air is dry causing most to
need to check their water supply fearing to become so parched before
reaching the city.  The road itself continues on towards the west leading to
the city and north leading back the towards the Plains of Dust.

{DA Dark Tunnel{x~
A long and dark tunnel continues forward twisting and curving beneath the
city.  There are torch brackets at 5ft-interval along the walls, and those
that are still burning cast a flickering light across the room giving the
impression the floor shifting beneath those that attempt to travel through
such darkness.  Dark shadows play in the light, or perhaps it's a shadowy
figure that is darting in between the flickering light.  Cobwebs cover the
top of the dirt ceilings, causing some to entangle within the hair of those
not careful.

{DA Dead End{x~
The tunnel open up to a large room yet seems to be a dead end.  The
ground has been packed hard as if it once had been used as a storage room. 
There are imprints upon the ground where obvious boxes had been.  The
ceilings can hardly be seen, being so high the darkness swallows what might
be above.  If one were to travel further into the room they would find a
skeleton that has been shoved into the furthest corner, hidden within the
dark shadows.

Along the Sea Wall~
On the far western edge of Tarsis lies the prominent sea-wall.  Composed
of interlocking gray cobblestones, this street was built to allow the
passage of many down its wide path.  The sounds of the city echo about as
travelers and citizens alike make their way through to different
destinations.  A high wall of granite runs along the side of the road
creating a barrier of sorts from the once sparkling blue waters of the sear.
Large lanterns have been placed along the side of the street as well to be
lit as the sun sinks below the horizon and night falls.  Plots of grass,
small flowers and ornamental trees have been planted along side the sawmill
wall in hopes to add color to the area.  Buildings made from gray stone line
up and down the western wall, composing both shops and homes for the cities
populace.

The old waterfront once glimmered brightly with the sea, but now only
holds sand and wastelands in its sights.  Three huge winged ships sit in the
dry docks to the south tilted and slanted as the bottoms of the three ships
are buried at odd angles.  A large plank leads to the Ships Hull Graveyard
taking those to the ships who wish to explore them more closely.

The dusty road continues towards the west as the winds pick up causing
small dust devils to swirl about the area.  The ground is dusty, full of
pebbles and odd shaped stones that have been crushed and stomped upon.  A
few desert critters can be seen scrambling through the dry and crackling
underbrush upon anyone's sudden movement down the road.  The air is dry
causing most to need to check their water supply fearing to become so
parched before reaching the city of Tarsis to the east.

Entrance to the Palace~
Entering the Palace most would be in awe at the very sight of the
structure of this building.  Nothing seems to have harmed the beautiful
dwarven craftsmanship of this structure Large marble pillars detailed with
fine gold ivy running around them line the front of the palace.  Each one
has two white wings inlaid with faint gold detail, guarding the top of the
pillars.  Beautiful double marble doors guard the entrance to the palace. 
One could see their reflection within the white marble floors that have been
waxed to a shine.  Towards the north another set of marble doors can be
seen, each has been carved into the shape of two giant wings.  Towards the
east is the guard room, no doors have been placed upon them.  Two guards
stand at the entrance on duty.

each arm, in laid with gold around the high back a shining jewel is set
there, an odd light emanating from it.

Large, gilt doors open up onto a beautiful room.  The floors have been
made from squares of highly polished gray marble, and the walls are a light
green color with gold trim.  Elaborate oil paintings and large mirrors hang
from the walls while various plants have been placed about the room.  Next
to the door a Guard stands at attention in case of any problems that may
arise.  On the high vaulted ceiling are skylights and a large chandelier
made from crystal drops.  Clerks hurry to and fro carrying notes and
moneybags in and out from the back rooms.  Sitting behind a desk made of
gleaming walnut is the bank teller who handles all the transactions himself.
He is dressed in the finest clothing money can buy, and only ceases writing
in his ledgers when addressed.

silhouetted against the sky.  The surrounding area is filled with small

swirl, rotating around the area and kicking up clouds of blinding dirt. 
Small pebbles, stones, and at times trash litter the dirt-covered road.  The

winds east; back toward the Plains of Dust.

The Gates of Tarsis~
Sand blasted planks form a stout gate, which stands silent watch over the
dunes and scorpions of the desert.  In addition to the voluminous piles of
sand, which lie about the wide stone walls and the gate itself, shards of
broken crockery are piled against the outer wall to the left of the gate. 
The gate itself bears mute witness to its history, bearing scars of both axe
and flame.  Guards can be seen walking the wall above and pennants flap
slowly in the hot breeze which blows from the north.  The remains of a
cobbled path can be seen on the approach to the gate, mostly obscured by a
thick coating of fine sand.

The Inner Gates of Tarsis~
After passing through the outer gate, an inner gate formed of thick
wooden planks stands ominously closed, filling the gatehouse with the scent
of pitch.  Bound with thick copper bands, the inner gate's strength is
unquestionable.  With murder holes and arrow slits on the walls and ceiling,
the gatehouse is a veritable killing field not to be underestimated.  Its
thick stone walls complete the bastion's construction, its stonework even a
dwarf would be proud of.  To the north, the outer gate offers some
protection from the winds; blowing from the desert dunes which rise up to
meet the sky.  The sounds of commerce can be heard coming from the south.

Guard Station~
An offshoot of the inner gate has been made into a small guard room.  A
ladder sits against the far wall, allowing the guards to climb up and look
out over the surrounding area.  There is a rack full of different types of
weapons, as well as a few cots; allowing the guards to change shifts to get
their rest during a slow night.  The air is stifling, as it is a small and
cramped room with little space to move about.

Guards Outlook~
The guards' outlook is quite a bit more refreshing than down below in the
room.  It extends all along the walls, giving the guards plenty of room to
move about.  The guards can see clear to the north, even the peaks of
Thorbadin.  There is a small chest near the ladder that runs down into the
guardroom, containing food for the soldiers on duty.

Intersection of Main and the Northern Wall~
The city's main street has been paved with gray cobblestones that are now
well worn with the passage of time.  Despite their age, they have been kept
cleanly swept and well repaired.  The different sounds of the city seem to
ring about the area at all times, day or night, echoing broadly up and down
Main street.  Lanterns have been hung along the edge of the street to be lit
as the sun sets below the horizon.  Along with the lanterns, small plots of
flowers and ornamental trees have been planted along the side as well,
adding a bit of color and decoration to the streets appearance.  To the
north lies the city gates and to the south Main street continues on.  The
northern wall runs to the east and west.

{RRed Dragon Inn{x~
This is a warm and cozy entry way to the Red Dragon Inn.  A sturdy coat
rack is beside the door, giving guests a place to hang their cloaks.  There
is a quiet crackling noise coming from somewhere towards the west, where a
small head can be glimpsed bustling about behind a desk.  The entryway
itself is small, yet has a beautifully decorated wall.  Small paintings as
well as a case that holds a variety of antique equipment have been
tastefully mounted to either side.  The only obvious exits lead west into
the Inn, or out the door the the east.

Along the Northern Wall~
On the far Northern edge of Tarsis lies the prominent northern wall. 
Composed of interlocking gray cobblestones, this street was built to allow
the passage of many down its wide path.  The sounds of the city echo about
as travelers and citizens alike make their way through to different
destinations.  A high wall of granite runs along the side of the road
creating a barrier of sorts from the outside world.  Large lanterns have
been placed along the side of the street as well to be lit as the sun sinks
below the horizon and night falls.  Plots of grass, small flowers and
ornamental trees have been planted along side the sawmill wall in hopes to
add color to the area.  Buildings made from gray stone line up and down the
northern wall, composing both shops and homes for the cities populace.  To
the northwest one could see the large gates rising in the sky.
