[16290] Hiddukel: Innkeeper only transfers people to the SMALL ROOM, no matter how much gold is given to him
[ 2582] Vilae: When hidden, messages still  go to the intended and gives away position.
[ 9838] Akiran: when i dual a weap type that i dont have prac'd hardly, i hit 80-90's as if I had it pracd, but when i primary wield that weapon type, i hit 20's 30's.. maybe a bug? 
[11622] Darkahn: Tells come through when editing your description with DESC EDIT.
[11144] Simon: I think this is a bug, but am not certain.  The Bozak Draconian has the dark dagger.  And I don't entirely know what you're supposed to do to get it from him, aside from probably blind, then disarm, but, when I blind and disarm, then take the dagger on the ground, he dies, and drops another?  Sensible?
[ 3021] Delaris: When in spirit form, plague can affect you.
[  967] Hade: Okay for some reason Iam riding an invisible horse
[ 3710] Callyst: your prompt color leaks into the rest of everyting... its all pretty much maroon until something of another color comes in and changes it
[13789] Gilean: clan guardians display full NAME field in their clan messages (i.e. "solamnic knight headquarter guard guardian informs: __)
[ 3005] Serie: Found out the hard way, casting sleepless curse on someone who is already under sleep allows the person to move around but s/he is unable to talk (emotes, socials still work).
[ 3732] Reserk: Magic missile, at least at level 4, says it costs 15 mana, really costs 20.
[ 3145] Tylpea: Miniscule bug: trying to check "quest time" in your sleep gives you a "In your dreams, or what?" response.  Seems pointless.
[15207] Darkahn: Breath of the Dead works in safe-zones.
[17564] Simon: When you mount a horse, and stalk, you continue to stay as if you were mounted, although, you haven't a horse with you.  Once you dismount, there still is no horse.  Figure, you shouldn't be able to stalk with the horse in the first place.
[ 3857] Alvarish: rangers guild in kalaman, I entered as a battlemage
[ 2563] Reorx: The Street vendor is getting into the guilds... a procedure should be added to it so he don't enters a building
[ 3115] Darkahn: Word of Death, even if successful, starts the gate/shadow walk/recall timer.
[ 2861] Ivan: Well, i think the hunt command is making the mud crash as track was...
[ 3757] Arlo: There seems to be something wrong with the score code.  Everytime I type score, there is a strange sequence of numbers and such right before the word encumberance, and it causes part of my score to be scewed on my screen.
[  832] Ciro: the amazon in the store can't be bought using 'buy amazon' or 'buy warrior'
[17843] Dori: The polish skill isn't working like it should. I started with 15 at charisma and when i polish weapons, more then once, it starts droping. At this moment i have char at 6...
[ 2635] Tattiana: It seems if you polish to many items instead of letting the charisma max out it resets and starts over and begins to go up all over again. Example: My base charisma is 13 after 3 items polished it was 19 after tthe 4th or 5th it reset and now I have a 4 charisma
[11735] Rina: The little trick with the skeleton key and Maerty's tattoo doesn't seem to work anymore - Palid snaps the key every time, regardless of whether Maerty has the tattoo
[ 2900] Tabel: the fountain never has enough water left to drink.
[ 1215] Paladine: if a target evades a spell then the target used in an act message will be <@@@>
[ 9983] Reorx: i don't think this area should be here....
[ 3080] Haelan: Compare is doing some bizzarre things: Leather gauntlets looks worse than a leather facemask./A noble's garb and boots of speed look about the same.
[ 3700] Navarre: there is a door here when I try to go south, it says its closed. I try to do "open door" but it says there is no door here, thats contradictive
[ 3005] Sunder: if someone is mounted, and lull (effect name) is cast..they cant wake up after the effect has worn off..
[ 3806] Rina: "a statue of the Golden General" in Kalaman (3806) is out of water.
[ 3001] Vilae: I know it's not a bug, but it's something. I was fighting a zombie in the graveyard with Kaiin. I ended up dieing, but I didn't lose any exp. Kaiin didn't kill me and there was nobody else in the room. I didn't gain any exp to lvl at all.
[ 3261] Darkahn: Money changers cannot see invisible people, thus you lose all gold you give them if you are invisible. This has only been tested on some. Namely Otho in Palanthas.
[ 3713] Senji: "The ripped off face of Senji lies on the floor." after i killed a prisoner in the nwebie school, but i hadn't died.
[ 3344] Phyrexia: list
[ 1673] Kougyoku: add lev effect for a few hours while invul so players wont drown to their deaths.
[  902] Darkahn: Necromancer spell detect presence ignores wizinvis.
[ 9897] Darkahn: Give Charron some damn necromancer potions. :| Two years and he still sells nothing.
[16356] Jory: when i try to compare something like a neckguard for example it compares it to the eq in the body spot. and ive had this happen on other items as well.
[ 1209] Paladine: Fix so tells goto players first.
[ 1215] Paladine: change wiznet clan so it shows pc text only
[ 3054] Paladine: change so questmaster no longer assigns quests inside clan halls (ie find item inside a clan hall)
[17826] Sunder: port o call city guards leaving in the middle of a fight
[ 2600] Darkahn: ''The Kitchen'' with Tika Waylan has been constantly changed from safe-zone to non-safe zone.
[ 3005] Jory: compare is still really buggy.
[ 1215] Paladine: Fix so if players are deleted for any reason or logon with no clan remove them from their respective roster.
[ 3054] Darkahn: Trip is not affected by Paralysis
[  985] Frederik: Yeah, the compare skill is buggy like crazy. I usually compare my belt to my sword or something.... it needs some revamping
[ 4849] Darkahn: Some of the Undead mobs on Dargaard appear not to have the UNDEAD act on them, and none have an evil alignment.
[ 3011] Purteal: dagger
[ 3242] Darkahn: Charmed Mobs/Pets when attacked show up as a PK attempt on their owner.
[ 3242] Darkahn: Spells, even while in a fight already, show up as a PK attempt on the victim.
[16179] Darkahn: Lemli in The Pet Store in Thorbardin 2 is not in a safe zone.
[ 2853] Darkahn: The great white sharks don't have an attack word, so it looks like "A great white shark's  misses you"
[ 3110] Darkahn: Banquet Hall, east door cannot be closed from inside, only from audience chamber (where it is the west door)
[10959] Jibble: how do i tinker
[10035] Tuor: I think theese rooms shouldn't be here....
[ 3355] Dragkar: leg
[10128] Gulgor: I think that there is a bug to report.  It would seem that using the recall command can bring someone out of combat.  I have noticed this because someone who I have been in battles with for a few days uses the recall command to get out of battle and lunge me again.  Is this a bug or is this supposed to happen?
[ 3026] Tyee: This may or may not be a bug, but when I sneak and backstab someone, after the fight I'm still sneaking.  Should that be so?
[ 1805] Ciro: well, i was reading dwarf helpfile and it says they get berserk for free.... but it costs 50 mana.... 
[ 3255] Darkahn: The skeleton warrior mobs made by necromancers are ''it'' in their cposes and descs, but their actual gender is male.
[ 3005] Darkahn: Cancellation can be used on non-group members. In the helpfile, it says it can only be used on group members.
[14941] Bain: missing keyword on the item "an emrald" found on Tasslehoff in kender town
[ 9467] Bain: The desk with the gold ring in it disappeared while fighting the guardian for key..
[10891] Gulgor: I'm not sure whether to call this a bug or not, but it seems that if you try hard enough to get into Tinker Bell's shop atop of the tower in Mt.Nevermind, you can get in without the usage of a Senior report.
[17807] Alera: Tried rally and ended up with negative mana. My guess is that it subtracted mana for each person in the room that I tried to rally.
[ 3005] Darkahn: The 'comb' social is over-rided by the 'combine' command.
[ 3001] Dominus: i accidentily gave a frost reaver to a horse, when i killed said horse..i didnt get the frost reaver back, even when autoloot was on.
[ 3354] Dominus: ignore that last bug report by me...im an idiot...
[17850] Alera: The bloody dagger is a level 55 weapon. I'm fortyish yet I can wield it. But I can't use it in my second hand because my level is too low. Not sure if its suppose to work this way . . .
[ 1213] Sargonnas: The 'sing' command interferes with the sing social.
[13305] Alera: In the middle of crystalmir lake (and under it) are farmers harvesting grain. 
[ 3005] Alera: Not so much of a bug as much as this doesn't make sense. I attack a hobgolbin guard in the plains. The other hobgoblin guard screams "TIME TO DIE CRIMINAL!!!" and helps me to kill the guard. I'm 1000 good but this doesn't make sense...to me at least.
[ 3005] Bain: gully dwarfs seem able to pick stuff up even when there being slept in.
[ 3131] Vaurd: the door leading to the palace gardens in palanthas can be opened northward, but not closed southward from the ajacent room, ie from inside the gardens
[ 3145] Alera: Not sure where to put this so...here I go. At the questmaster's in Palanthas, the parchment says that it "Gives HP and Mana regen (Recovery) Bonuses" From my experiance, mana recovery is about 5-10% of what it is without the bag. So...either the sign is wrong, or the bag's not working right, or I'm wrong...
[ 3707] Tarsis: gloves
[ 3334] Vaurd: otho cant change gold to steel if your invis..lost 350K gold now..
[ 1211] Paladine: preach will reveal wizi immortals
[ 3364] Darkahn: Scrolls can be recited while paralyzed.
[ 3136] Lacitus: torag
[10966] Gurdok: There is a bug when brandishing the staff named Black Moonstone, which is sold at 'The Inner Glow' in Mt. Nevermind. After the two charges are used the message shown is 'Your a Black Moonstone blazes bright and is gone.' Obvisiously it isnt correct. Best regards.
[14950] Gurdok: at kendermore there is a pub named The Grande Pub. As we go upstairs we find the owner's office. there some papers are on the ground. when we cast identify on them the desc ends with a strange 'It is written in' followed by our prompt. Quite strange.
[ 3707] Yeirokou: leggings
[ 3334] Mazgord: Eversharp doesnt cost anything..neither does sharpen for that matter..
[ 3334] Darkahn: Dunno if this is a bug or not, but fingerbreak doesn't stop bard songs and such. Lemme ask you this, can YOU play instruments right with broken fingers? :P I also think 'forget' should stop bard songs, as they should forget the song, and maybe garblemind too.
[ 5721] Paladine: bribe not working
[17129] Darkahn: Spectre doesn't have the UNDEAD act/whatever, or atleast is not immune to Dark Magic, when other undead are
[ 9638] Darkahn: Massive Spiral Staircase:  No one can get in  by foot.
[ 9749] Gurdok: Im 101 and when I ask the Questmaster from Urione to make a quest he sends me to kill Urione's executioner. The thing is that the executioner is in a non-fighting room. Best regards
[ 3162] Darkahn: The door on the Palanthas to Nevermind ship can be sealed, thus fucking up the MPROG.
[17218] Darkahn: All the Urione mobs don't have waterbreath, thus, they try to breathe in the water and take damage.
[10973] Paladine: this room is sirrons temple and is also the cleric guild
[ 3145] Ganan: i think the quest sleeping bag isnt working correctly for mana regen i sleep in the sleeping bag and my mana regens extreamly slow slower even then if i was standing
[15766] Ganan: i beleave the alignment system is working wrongly when i kill "good" people i become more good
[17132] Paladine: all mobs in Urone2 need waterbreath
[10633] Ganan: if you are carrying your max amount of items you can not retreave a item from your container you are carrying
[17748] Ganan: I am not sure what is causeing it but the City guard's in port O call are walking out of the room in the middle of fights (NOT FLEEING)
[  500] Thoron: When I donated 8 Newbie Orbs to the shelves in the Forester Clanhall, they disappeared.
[17842] Paladine: add SECTOR_SOLAMNIC allowed to apprehend
[  901] Azaeruil: A few days ago, I had blackjacked Dalegard, and somehow he woke up, from poison or something, yet he couldnt be blackjacked again might be a bug.
[ 3009] Paladine: demand works on shopkeepers
[ 3001] Paladine: too many notes in the spool will disconnect you
[ 3714] Pallen: autoloot and autosac not working more than 25 percent of time... lost pet during log out, couldn't buy new.  char's 'tallen' and 'pallen'.
[ 3712] Pallen: if you have rabbits in newbie land and get booted for reaching level 6, rabbits don't follow, and you can't cast more.  thanks ya'll for all the hard work!
[17842] Dasku: bar
[17869] Ender: It says that there is a road to the west, but the only exit is east
[16387] Reimor: in the Plains of Dust when a sandstorm sweeps you away it takes away your mount but you are still mounted, like what happend with stalk while mounted!
[ 3210] Dietrich: Not sure if this is a bug or not, but hideous zombies (animated by the Necromancer spell 'animate corpse') are described as 'its' in their description, but their sex is male.
[ 9400] Danch: Its new and bound to have bugs, if your mounted while trying to get into the tower it takes away your mount but still considers you mounted, if you type dismount your mount appears back at Before the grove and wont heel if you are in palanthas.
[ 3145] Zallen: Second time I was given a 'quest' to kill the gully dwarf in front of Dragon Inn in Palanthas, I killed the dwarf, over and over, and quest still not complete.  Looked for other gully dwarves in Palanthas, but none had [target] flag.  Gully dwarves in fron tof inn had [target] flag... just FYI.
[ 3145] Zallen: sleeping bag bought from questmaster actually slows mana recovery.  Sleeping alone gives 33 mp per tic, in bag 4 mp per tic... if it matters, i am lvl 10 Battlemage, Minotaur, Lawful Neutral, Meditation=75%, 27 int/30 wis... Any other info required, contact Zallen.  Thank you for your time.
[ 3145] Zallen: It may be on purpose, but when questing in Palanthas, I have noticed that quests for items (Tahkisis Crown, Grey Gem, Tome of Astinus) are too easy.  The item seems to ALWAYS be in the same location as the last 'kill' quest was completed.  For instance, I get a quest to kill the 'Dreaded little boy' somewhere in the area of 'Worship hall'.  After I kill the boy, and return, get the reward... wait for a new quest.  Quest is to find the grey gem, i find it in the same room as the little boy of the previ
[ 1210] Adventurgirl: The blowjob social accepts a woman target, which is inappropriate.
[ 1210] Adventurgirl: The pronouns used by the blowjob social do not agree with the gender of the player when it is used by a female.
[ 1210] Adventurgirl: The pronouns used by the urine social do not agree with the gender of the target player when it targets a male.
[ 3806] Ronnik: The "A Small Marble Bench" in Kalaman can be slept on but not rested on, not sure if the builders made it that way for a reason but thought I'd let you know.
[ 1943] Talwin: I hope this is the right category, but I see there is no actual helpfile for feeblemind... indeed, I'm not even sure what the spell is supposed to do..
[17842] Sunder: though i realise ive been away for a while and things change, but shouldnt there be a bartender in the last call?..
[ 3163] Kougyoku: boat messages here come too quickly
[ 3009] Bromm: big
[ 3156] Saudin: boy
[ 5485] Kougyoku: taunt gets around nopk
[ 1202] Paladine: create rose spell allows you to go over item limit (ex: items 105/103)
[ 3052] Pallen: 'Help Report' needs to be changed.  'Report' is not a working command.  This help file is accessed by help 'report', 'commands', 'score', 'time', 'weather'.
[ 3011] Ralesha: There seems to be a slight problem with haggle. When selling, you seem to try to sell for a lower price instead of a higher one. Not very smart shopping me thinks.
[ 3054] Trallen: The 'Backstab' helpfile states that any weapon can be used to backstab.  When trying to backstab while wielding a sword, I recieved a message stating 'you can only backstab with daggers'.  Please correct the help file.
[ 1943] Tallen: help file for 'flaming shield' indicates it can be cast another.  In practice, caster can only cast the spell on himself.
[ 3145] Hoyt: Quests still put items in guild halls, had one for the master assassin's room in palanthas
[17703] Adrian: I can't play "Song of the Compassion." I've got a harp in my hand and I've tried just play song of the compassion, play song of compassion, play 'song of the compassion', play 'song of compassion'....and none of it seems to be working. It always says "That isn't a song."
[ 5946] Rylinthai: I'm pretty sure, not too certain though. Thats why I'm tellin ya. I kept getting extreme lag when I enterd this room. If bug command doesn't say the room, just ask me...Well, Luther sent me a tell saying OMG LAG!. I left the room and re-entered...again he said it. So yeah...
[ 9464] Marthias: I seem to not be able to quit. It tells me I am still fighting, however, I haven't been fighting for about 13 minutes now. And my heart isn't beating or anything like that. Just says 'No way! You are fighting.'
[17705] Sethis: Notes addressed to kotoasa are arriving to the KoT.
[11608] Sethis: Notes to "Kotoasa" are delivered to the KOT clan.
[17843] Kitan: So I was logging onto the game, minding my own business, when out of nowhere I start fighting Relith, now the strange part of this is that I was in the Questmaster's room, and he was on Daargard mountain.
[ 3354] Dominic: I was able to eversharp a mace. Is that supposed to happen?
[ 3354] Dominic: Was also able to runeblade a mace.
[ 3334] Silynt: Even if visible, Otho (at the Palanthas Bank) will not give your exchanged coins to you if under the affect of the Doppelganger spell.
[  152] Kaferana: I think that my create food spell is bugged. I have to create like...30 mushrooms just to get stuffed, but on another character, I can create 3 goodberry's and get stuffed from eating just 3....
[19112] Kaeliwen: enlighten stacks against another player, but it won't stack against me.
[ 3350] Paladine: Bounty is broken will not collect even when person has the head
[ 1200] Paladine: immortals should always be visiable on the who list unless wizi or affected by an invis spell.. so if the player is blind or in a dark room and has no light they can still see imms
[ 1200] Paladine: player can create more mirror images if they log off and log back in
[ 4800] Paladine: cannot find this room using rwhere
[ 3054] Paladine: illusion comes up as Someone even with wizi
[ 3009] Mictian: all i am carrying is a can o'whoop ass and a bottomless pouch, but when i try to get food from my Can, IT says i can't carry that many items.. But um, i am only carrying 2 items
[17797] Mictian: Jab skill doesnt trigger weapon affect, sutch as brilliant energy.
[ 2812] Mictian: cant pray when dead
[ 1943] Mictian: when someone is invis i can see them go to sleep or wake up. IF they are invisible, i wouldnt be able to see them!
