a puddle of slime~
A puddle of slime lies before you.
~
If you ever have a little too much to drink one night, you'll see this
puddle-like creature on your bathroom floor.  Slimes damage the durability
of any melee weapon used on them, AND they use a weak form of poison.  These
things are extremely annoying.

This scroll has been torn in several places, and crackles with age,
threatening to crumble if handled too roughly.  There is a dark stain that
might be blood obscuring a portion of the text, though some of it can still
be made out: 
 
"{y...weeks searching this blasted forest, and still no end in
sight. It is almost as if the very Gods themselves are against us!
I know something the others do not, however... The enchantment cost
me dearly indeed, but it will soon be worth it. Soon the secrets of
the forest will be mine! A shame I will have to kill Tangred and
Ristani.. but I simply cannot afford to share the secret. If
'They' found out... But they won't. I've taken all the
necessary pre-{x"
 
The text ends here in an abrupt scrawl, though there seem to be a
series of letters burned into the surface of the parchment...

Inside the Northern Gate of Thorbardin~
Stopping to take a look around, the walls here appear to have been
expertly dug out, leaving the walls with a nice obsidian look and a smooth
texture.  Although there are no torches to lead your way, dwarves not having
a need for such things, there does appear to be some moss growing all over
the ceiling of the cave hole.  What makes this moss so appealing, is it's
ability to give off just enough light for you to make out your surroundings,
yet isn't bright enough to be considerably noticeable.

Near the Northern Entrance~
Deeper and deeper into Thorbardin you go.  The walls appear to be as
smooth here as the rest of the tunnel is.  The same glowing moss, seeming to
dominate most of the walls, grows all about you.  A slight breeze blows by
you, the wind coming from over east, over where the entrance to this Dwarven
Masterpiece lies.  The moss gives off a poor amount of light, and your own
personal source of light isn't enough to penetrate the darkness of what lies
below.  Watching your step might be a very good idea, so you don't trip,
fall and break your neck.

Down upon a ledge~
You find yourself in a wide, open cave-like hole.  Dug out by the Dwarves
of Thorbardin, the walls have been polished to a very smooth texture.  Small
patches of glowing moss appear to be growing on the ceiling portion of these
caves, giving you just enough light to make heads and tails of where you
are.  The light is also bright enough to reflect off the smooth surfaces of
the wall, glimmering obsidian mirror like walls.

Bottom of a Shaft~
The cave here opens up into a wide cavern, leading south, or up into a
shaft which serves as the entrance and exit into this massive Dwarven city
Looking up, a large vine hangs down the length of the shaft, serving as a
rope which could be used to climb up out of here.  To the south, darkness
seems to prevail over light.

Down a tight hole~
You find yourself in a low, tight fitting cave hole.  Dug out by the
Dwarves of Thorbardin, the walls have been polished to a very smooth
texture.  Small patches of glowing moss appear to be growing on the ceiling
portion of these caves, giving you just enough light to make heads and tails
of where you are.  The light is also bright enough to reflect off the smooth
surfaces of the wall, glimmering obsidian mirror like walls.

Down a tight hole~
You find yourself down at the bottom of this small hole.  Looking on to
your south, it appears that your path opens up a little, although not much. 
Looking back up towards the darkness, it only seems to become more
constricting.  Perhaps a more relaxing journey further into the depths of
Thorbardin would be much easier than to try your luck back up the congested
shaft.  Not only does it appear to an easier walk, but it also appears to be
more promising, in the way that it seems to get brighter, rather than
darker.

Before the Kharolis Mountains~
Looking up at this great mountain before you, you realize that to climb
up, would certainly mean death, for the mountain travels too steep and the
surface too smooth to find any good footholds.  Looking back, straight ahead
to the south, stands the entrance into the fabled Thorbardin.  An
underground city built many, many years ago by different tribes of dwarves. 
The entrance here on the northern side was, for the longest time, sealed
off.  However, it appears that the rubble has been cleared and the entrance
has been reopened.  Although the hole appears to be a tight squeeze for
anyone larger than a dwarf, with enough determination and patience, even a
Minotaur could squeeze through there.

Intersection of Thenal and Barik~
The meeting of these two streets looks more like a police barricade than
an intersection.  With the upper class nobility and their manor houses to
the south, and the hangout of the worst portions of the city's criminal
element to the east, quite a bit of tension exists around this end of town. 
A sizeable force of the city guard is always present, making sure that the
large manors are protected from what might come out of the alleys.

Thenal Road~
Treading through this back alley road, many of the worst elements of the
city begin to appear all around you.  A strong scent of rotting garbage
hangs carelessly in the air, making it difficult to breathe.  This stench is
also accompanied by the smell of decaying corpses, which have been tossed
along the sides of old buildings and out of plain view.  Although they can
be seen by passersby, very few decent citizens would ever dare come to this
part of town.

Gateway to the Daergar City~
This appears to be one of the entrances to the city, though hardly
looking like the main gate.  The tunnel here seems to empty out into a back
alley road made from large chunks of gravel and dirt.  Because the Daergar
dwarves are repulsed by light, especially sunlight, the city is kept
completely dark.  Along with the stale, unmoving air, the stench of rotting
corpses is noticeable as you stumble upon several bodies tossed behind a
nearby building with their throats slashed.  This is a display of the
affection that awaits you in the city.

Intersection of Thenal and Galdar~
Perhaps one of the more vile and sinister street corners in the city, the
intersection of these two roads represents the meeting of the most destitute
and brutal portions of the Daergar.  Though there are a few homes in this
portion of Galdar Street, no shops would dare open this far north.  There
are also very few people who move around in this part of town, as the fear
of being mugged is greater here than anywhere else.  Most of the movement
that can be heard comes from the areas concealed by refuse and old
buildings.

Shop of Blak Coldforge~
Looking to be a small house converted into a weapons shop, this home
appears as a museum of death.  Weapons of every sort can be seen lining the
walls and countertops, matched only by the mob of customers perusing these
items.  Since the blacksmith of the town passed on several years ago without

an apprentice, all the weapons in the city needed to be imported from other
parts of the mountain.  This is what has allowed this small home of Blak to
be totally changed into an imported weapons shop, and turned Blak into one
of the most wealthy merchants of the Daergar.

street is also more crowded and heavily traveled.  This road, aside from
being made of perfectly cut stones and designed by some of the best
architects in the mountain, also has a rather advanced sewage system,
keeping a considerable of the city's refuse from building up along the sides
of the street.  The massive manor houses along this street are also an
architectural marvel, being made from stone bricks imported from all over
Thorbardin.  While most of the buildings here are single floor homes for the
warrior class, a few of the keeps for the nobles span near the ceiling of
this city.

towards the gods of evil and darkness, there are representations of every
deity here in this building of worship.  Along with the few seats which
appear in front of the statues of the gods surrounding the perimeter of this
room, there are also a cluster a pews in the center of the temple, facing
the main worship altar.  Quite a few of the citizens and clerics can be seen
wandering through the temple, stopping to pay homage to their deities as
they pass by.

The Temple Library~
The interior of this old structure certainly gives away the former
purpose of the building: as that of an old temple dedicated to the secret
priests of Hiddukel.  When the new temple was built next to this one, this
space was used for a library for students of the temple to continue their
studies.  Although seeming to be out of place in such a brutal society, the
library is stocked with books brought back from clan raids and from times
when the mountain was still open to the outside world.  Many of the books on
these shelves are either partially burned or contain bloodstains along the
pages....  Or both.

is plain to see why this area is much more rundown and destitute than the
rest of the city.  While most of the buildings are either boarded up or
filled with rubble, a few shops appear to still be in operation.  A few
citizens can be seen moving in and out of the various stores, buying mostly
masonic and leather wares for their homes.

Gateway to the Daergar City~
From the wind tunnels created by the air currents of the East Warrens,
the entrance to the Daergar City comes into view.  After allowing the eyes
time to adjust to the complete lack of light in the area, a rather primitive
and unkempt series of buildings and roads appear, reflective of the brutal
and uncaring nature of this clan of dwarves.  The houses and shops are built
with a mixture of wood and stone components, while the roads seem to be
nothing more than large slabs of rock laid together in an almost straight
line.  Although quite a few people can be seen wandering the streets, no one
dares walk around without some sort of weapon handy.

equipment and weapons for their next crusade.  To the north, there is a shop
which appears to be receiving quite a bit more business than the rest.  A

south are the homes and manors of the warrior class and the nobility, some
of which reach nearly to the ceiling.  To the east is the main thoroughfare of
the city, where both the temple and military barracks are located.  Although
there is not much in the way of shops in this area, quite a few people are
always wandering the streets here.

Within the center of the city lies the administrative buildings for the
Daergar.  Due to the brutal nature of the clan, most of these buildings
consist of police and military barracks, housing the ruthless guard patrols
which maintain order among the citizens.  This street also houses several of
the clerical orders in the city, who also attempt to bring about peace
through their own brand of order.  To the north, a large, intricately carved
temple can be seen, with quite a few robed priests walking around and
discussing matters of faith and politics.  Just above the massive wooden
doors of the temple are runic symbols, representing the twenty-one gods of
Krynn.  To the south is a large rectangular building, which appears to be
the main guard station for the city.  With no windows and only a single,
heavily guarded steel door for an entrance, this stronghold looks prepared to
withstand quite an assault.

books of all shapes and sizes.  To the south, a considerable amount of noise
can be heard, which sounds like the shaping of metal.  And with smoke coming
out of a small hole on the roof, the building would seem to be a smithy of
some sort.

dividing line between the artisans and warriors in the city.  Following the
road to the west, quite a few large buildings come into view, including a
black-stoned temple and the military barracks for the city guard. 
Continuing along this north-south street and to the east are the few masons
and artisans in the city, providing the necessary wares and furnishings for
the many homes within this part of Thorbardin.

be quite uninhabited, there seems to be some activity coming from a shop to

many items surrounding the room, there are also very expensive decorations
covering the floor and walls, including hand woven carpeting from the Life

Within the confines of this large yet simple building resides the patrol

justice, the hall is more of a trophy room for the various battles fought
and won by the city guard.  Other than pieces of armor and a few weapons
scattered around the room, there are very few decorations or furniture. 
Mostly, this building is used for either training exercises or interrogation
of prisoners.  Several fresh bloodstains can be seen along the floor.

Due to the constant violence in the streets, the ring of a large hammer

the considerable business this shop receives, the atmosphere here is very
plain and unsightly.  This dwelling, which is carved from a large mound of
granite, is completely devoid of decoration or comfort of any kind.  A
simple marble counter divides the shop area from the work area of the
blacksmith, making for quite a noisy place to sell armor.  However, this
shop never seems to disappoint customers, always having enough items in
stock.

Despite this shop being one of the few leatherworking posts in the
mountain, it doesn't appear to be doing much business within the Daergar
city.  Made from warping wooden planks imported into Thorbardin long ago,
the building interior attempts to reflect the atmosphere of woodsman life. 
This certainly makes the shop stick out in an area where the buildings are
designed mostly out of stone.  Although there are items of every sort in the
shop, the leather products are all made by the shopkeeper, and seem to
dominate the room on the shelves.

there are also the mansions and homes of the petty nobility of the Daergar. 
In this far western corner of the road, a gate can be seen to the north,
blocking entrance to the manor house of the Lord Chieftain of this clan. 
Although slightly more decorated and larger than the other homes along this
road, this manor still exudes the fear and ruthlessness which plagues the
rest of the city.  Atop this massive iron gate are the skulls of many of the
former enemies of the chieftain, a warning to all those who dare enter.

Gateway to the Daergar City~
Passing underneath a large stone gateway, the city of the Daergar dwarves
comes into full view.  Due to their extreme hatred of sunlight inherited
from their Theiwar cousins, the entire city is kept pitch black.  Because of
this, most of the buildings and the streets are in poor condition.  Most of
the housing and structures within sight seem to be rather primitive in
nature, displaying the somewhat crude and unrefined lifestyle of this clan. 
Although it's difficult to see, the sound of footsteps can always be heard.

to be very few people walking in this portion of town....  At least, that
you can see.  To the west is the more wealthy side of the city, where you
can see merchants and members of the nobility, dressed in their best
clothing, calmly moving through the street.  To the north, there is also a
considerable amount of activity, though most of the area consists of the
main markets and administrative buildings in the city.  A rather eerie
feeling passes over you as you peruse the alley to the east.  A shop carved
into the wall appears to the south, with several odd items displayed in the
window.

piled in front of a small steel door.  Obviously, only a select few know of
this place.  To the north, there appears a shop with quite a few bottles
displayed in the windows.  A bizarre bubbling noise can also be heard coming
from the north.  The area to the east darkens even further; a small side
passage just barely visible at the end of the alley.

mountain.  Although not very large, the size is compensated by the constan4
stringing of lutes and the singing of tales new and old.  Due to a conflict
of opinion about the actual events of a legend (and the continuous flow of
dwarf spirits among the patrons), an occasional fistfight can be seen
breaking out from one corner of the bar to the other.  Despite all this
activity, a lute can always be heard playing and a song will always be in
the air.

A Secret Shrine to Hiddukel~
This alcove is hidden deep within the shadowy recesses of the alley's
end.  A broken set of golden merchant's scales has been set atop a black
marble pedestal inset within the wall.  Cryptic chalk messages written in a
secret, scrawling language can be barely made out in places on the
surrounding stone.  Though the figures themselves are never seen, low voices
can occasionally be heard murmuring dark prayers to Hiddukel, god of
corruption and lies.  In the center of this room, is a large circular dias
made from pure gold, resting on top of a platinum frame.  Some writing has
been etched into the center of it.

altar~
Before you stands a large circular dias, made of pure gold, standing atop
of a platinum frame.  The frame itself is solid, with a semi-circle at the
top to hold the dias in place.  Upon the frame, in the center of it, is a
picture representing the face of Hiddukel, the mask of Comedy and Tragedy,
one half of the face is smiling, the other is frowning.  The circular dias
itself, made of pure gold, gleams brightly with lustre as the light from lit
torches reflect off of it's golden surface.  Upon closer examination, there
appears to be some writing etched in the center of the dias.

Entrance to the City of Klar~
After crossing through a large, stone pillar, you are immediately confronted
with a shabby, rundown building which looks like it has been in disrepair
for a long time.  This building is only one of many in such condition as you
peruse the city of Klar.  Once belonging to the artisans and smith's of
Thorbardin before the Cataclysm, it was later given to the Klar, a clan of 
hill dwarves trapped in the mountain and forced into servitude by the ruling
classes.  The city has been in shambles ever since.

Chieftain’s House~
Despite the low station of the Klar, they were allowed a chieftain in
power, though having little actual influence.  Although this house seems in
similar disarray as the rest in the city, it appears more lavish and eloquent.
The place appears decorated with paintings and weapons, perhaps to keep
memories alive of the glorious warriors these hill dwarves used to be.

This small, oblong area offers a slight reprieve from the bleak appearance of
the rest of the city.  With several old statues standing in the center and
many vendors setting up shops along the sides, this park offers a more 
congenial space for people to come and rest.  Thanks to the age-old acoustics
of the room's design, even the largest crowd's can function and hold their own
conversations without noise pollution from other discussions.

This street, which runs through the center of the city and connects the many
different districts together, once housed the merchants and middle class
citizens of the city.  Now, this dark, barren road only houses the families
of the Klar.  Due to overcrowding and poor sanitation upkeep, the road has
gone into major disrepair and is extremely dirty.  Many of the homes along
this street, once the pride of dwarven architecture, sit crumbling and badly
in need of repair.  To the east, a large building stands with many 
well-armed soldiers moving in and out of.

the western gate leading out of this magical like city of Theiwar.  Heading
north or south will continue your journey on Glume street, the street named
after the Theiwar's second Chieftain.  Walking east will bring you down
Thorer street, named after the great Thane of Thorbardin itself.  Looking
around the walls, you realize you don't really even need a light source, as
the walls appear to be emitting an eerie magical glow.  Quite odd for a
dwarven tribe to be dabbling in the arcane art of Magic.

directions in which you may travel.  Heading north will bring you deeper
into the Theiwar city and heading west will take you along the wall of this
strange pier.

Along the pier~
You find yourself walking along some sort of make shift pier, built to
hold back the deep, cold waters of the Urkhan Sea.  A slight cold mist of
the, seemingly odd for being underground, rough Sea water can be felt
hitting your face.  The Sea stretches off into the darkness to your south,
as dark as the black moon Nuitari itself.  Looking around, you notice that
you may only continue to walk along the wall of this pier, heading in an
easterly or westerly direction.  There doesn't appear to be any way of
getting down to the Sea's waters where you could eagerly travel across the
Sea and find yourself in another city.

Along Glume street~
You find yourself walking along a magically lit street, forged out of the
cavernous rock of the Kharolis Mountain.  This street was named after the
Theiwar's second Chieftain known better to all of Krynn as Glome the
Assassin, for his evil deeds and poor leadership as a forger of ore.  No
torches line the walls, only the mysterious moss which grows all about the
place.  Moss glowing as bright as if a hundred candles had been lit and
placed along the walls.  To the south, the distinct sound of water splashing
up against something hard can be heard.  Perhaps it leads to the fabled
Urkhan Sea.  Only way to find out would be to head in that direction, or
head back north, deeper into the city.

You find yourself walking along a lowly lit street.  Obviously this is
a street which once used to be nothing more than solid rock, but the Theiwar
Dwarves whom reside here, dug out a tunnel running through as a street.  A
small sign on the wall, surrounded by a few poorly lit torches, reads 'Glume
Street'.  The obvious ways out of here would be to head either north or
south.

east, there appears to be some sort of doorway, an open doorway with no
doors or anything of the sort to keep out anyone.  A small sign hangs over
the top of the entrance.  Perhaps a closer look will give you some clue as
to what resides through there.  Heading north or south will, obviously,
continue your journey down this street.

You have approached a corner in these cavernous streets.  Only a few
small pieces of glowing moss grows here, barely giving off enough light for
you to make your way around, without bumping into the smooth walls.  The
walls, smooth as a baby's behind, but fairly small, as it would seem that
these caves were only built for the passage of Dwarves.  Heading south will
bring you down Glume street and heading east will continue your journey
further down into another street.

Down a cavernous street~
Walking this smooth cavernous street makes you feel more like your
walking among a holy place.  The entire area having been well carved and
polished, giving the walls a very smooth texture and look to them.  Almost
smooth enough to see your own reflection in them, the lack of light prevents
it from becoming a reality.  There appears to be a very limited amount of
light, with only a few small patches of glowing moss growing here and there.
Not even your own source of light could cut through the dank darkness in
these caverns.

You find yourself standing at what appears to be an intersection in these

smooth texture, making it safe from impaling yourself on a sharp rock if you
accidentally stumbled into the walls, or on the floor.  Heading south will
bring you down into a more well lit area of Theiwar, whereas going east or
west, only brings you down to poorly lit areas of this Dwarven city.

The walls appear to have been carved with perfection.  Smooth to the touch

opening.  There doesn't appear to be any sights or sounds coming from

door is a small sign, just barely large enough to make out, perhaps you
better get closer to get a more accurate look.

of the room, is a short, old dwarf.  He appears to be open for business,
which is a good thing because you get the feeling that dwarves, not needing
much of a light source to see their way around the darkness, don't keep many
torches in their streets.

still gives off a good amount of light to give you a better look around at

could contain a magical power seems to be scattered about the room in a neat

south will give you an answer as to why there are any carvings at all like
this on the walls.  Extremely odd for a dwarf to carve into his beautiful
rock creation, let alone carve anything having to do with magic.  On the
ground, right before your feet near the southern entrance, is a large
pentagram with a circle running all the way around it.  Could it really be? 
Do dwarves actually dabble in magic?

poorly lit room stands a small dwarf.  Clad in black robes, with his head
looking down, he is intently studying a spellbook.  His hood has been pulled
over to conceal his face, requiring you to step closer than you'd care to,
to get a good look.  With the glowing moss growing all over the place, a
source of light seems almost out of place.  Perhaps this would be a good

which grows to provide an adequate amount of light here, appears to be
growing in perfect squares.  As if someone comes out all the time to tend to
it as one would with a garden, these patches of moss remind you of the way a
quilt pattern appears.  Heading south will bring you back out into the
streets of Theiwar and heading north will bring you further into this,

Carved out of the finest wood and done only by dwarves, the chair in itself
is a beauty to look at.  A marvel which could be considered to be one of the
great wonders of the world.  Although there doesn't appear to be anyone
occupying it at the moment, hopping right in would probably be a bad idea,
especially if one of the guards came back and caught you.  To your east and
west, are two small entrances to some sort of sub-chamber.  Perhaps none of
the Theiwar dwarves would be angry if you just peeked in to take a quick
glance.

cavernous street seem to hug you as you continue to your walk.  Although it
is oddly narrow, even for a dwarf, the ceiling is fairly tall, as if
stretching up towards the top of the mountain.  The smooth, glass like
obsidian walls make it easier to slip right through without too much
trouble.  Long gold chains hang down from the ceiling, with crystal
chandeliers attached to the bottoms of them, giving off a brilliant amount
of light.

At the corner of a pier~
You find yourself rounding a corner, where heading north will take you
along a pier along the Urkhan Sea, and heading east will take you to other
parts of Daewar city.  The smell of salt water overwhelms your senses as you
find yourself standing next to the Urkhan Sea.  However, the slight breeze
which usually comes with an ocean of any size, does not seem to come,
instead, only the salty scent reaches you.

Along a lustrous pier~
You find yourself standing along a very high pier.  Looking down over
the edge, it appears to be a high enough drop to kill a person if they
should fall.  The ground, as well as the wall opposite of the Urkhan Sea,
has a lustrous brilliance to them, as if forged from black opal.  The pier
continues to the north and south, the smell of salt lingering in the air.

Down a wide street~
The black opal walls appear to be much wider down this cavernous street
than most others you've walked upon.  Although now you have much more
breathing room, almost enough for two minotaur to walk along here side by
side, the ceiling is almost painfully low.  Where it would be a perfect
height for a dwarf, it would force anyone taller to hunch over to get
through without bumping their head.

Daewar way~
Here you find yourself standing on one of the most well forged streets in
all of Thorbardin.  The Daewar Dwarves appear to have put their heart and
soul in their work when they were digging out this street.  Intricately
carved statues of Dragons, protrude half way out of the glossy, obsidian
walls, a third dimensional look, giving the appearance that they are trying
to reach out and grab a hold of you.  The details in which they have, must
have taken weeks, if not months to complete.

A well constructed corner~
Rounding this corner in these cavernous streets gives you an insight as
to how well these Daewar Dwarves do business.  The walls have been perfectly
forged from the black opal which makes up this part of the Mountain. 
Polished to give it a smooth finish, the torches which have been well placed
reflect a brilliant shine off of them, making it fairly easy for you to see
your own reflection as if looking into a mirror.  The corner continues west
down a widened street and south down the infamous Daewar Way.

Gold Molder Bank~
Here you find yourself surrounded by large piles of gold.  Sitting right
in the center of the room is a well dressed dwarf, counting every piece one
by one.  Whereas it would appear that anyone interested in robbing this
place wouldn't have any trouble at all.  However, as you try to get one of
your greedy hands on some of the gold from the pile nearest to you, you
suddenly feel a tingling sensation, unable to get any closer than a two
finger width's away.  This is Thorbardin's great bank, the one and only
place all dwarves residing down here trust to keep their life savings.

The Architectural Shoppe~
You have walked into a small little shop, run by an old Dwarf standing
behind a counter in the back of the room.  The room has been forged into a
perfect cylindrical shape, with jewels encrusted into random spots to give
it a spectacular, wealthy look.  Behind the Dwarf is a large display case,
with all sorts of tools used to forge weapons, armor and other miscellaneous
furnishings.  Perhaps, even some of them could be used for battle.

Entrance to the Aghar city~
You stand before the opening of a long, dark tunnel.  Because the tunnel has
no light source, you cannot tell if this portal has an end or even opens into
anywhere.  The only thing you notice is the strong stench of a large amount
of garbage, and the occasional scurrying about of some animal.

Mounds of Garbage~
You stumble out of the tunnels and find yourself in a large area filled

used to house the waste from all over Thorbardin.  Although the stench is
excruciating, you are able to catch some breaths of fresh air from the
natural air ducts above you.  Strangely, you also get the feeling of
something moving in the trash piles under your feet...

Although there appears to be no torches or light source of any kind, the crypt
appears to be well illuminated from somewhere...

A tunnel~
You are traveling in a mid-sized tunnel, which appears to have been
burrowed by hand out of the soft surfaces around you.  Accompanying the
sticky mud collecting at your feet is a stench strong enough to drive away
insects.  You wonder how anything could possibly want to live in these
tunnels.

Before an Altar~
Clearing away the dust and cobwebs from your face, you find yourself in
the remains of an old tomb, obviously constructed for some great dwarf of
old.  Although there appears to be no torches or light source of any kind,
the crypt appears to be well illuminated from somewhere...  An altar is
built here, apparently designed to worship the god Reorx.

A Sarcophagus~
You find yourself in a cramped space underneath the altar, barely any
room to move.  Beneath your feet is an old sarcophagus, with many designs
and runes carved into the lid.  This space appears to be unusually cold...

Road before the South Gate of Thorbardin~
Standing upon the road before a great gate, more like a big hole in the
side of a really big rock, the Kharolis Mountains loon up into the sky,
blocking out most of the view to the heavens.  To the north is the entrance
to the underground city known as Thorbardin, a place built by many tribes of
dwarves.

Inside the Great Mountain~
You find yourself just inside the fairly large entrance into this vast
Mountain.  The road leading further in, continues on to your east, whereas
the exit is to the south.  Although it appears to be fairly dark, after your
eyes start to adjust, you notice that there appears to be some sort of
glowing moss, growing on the cavern ceiling.  It doesn't provide much light
in human terms, however, it's bright as the sun itself for a common dwarf.

Inside a dark tunnel~
You find yourself walking along this dark tunnel, with only a limited
amount of light, that which comes from the glowing moss growing on the
ceiling.  The slight, dim glow is just enough to help you see your way
around, but not enough to see what’s up ahead in either direction.  The light
seems to reflect a slight glow of the smooth, obsidian walls, almost enough
for you to see your own reflection.

Top of a steep slope~
Coming up to the top of a steep slope, you look down into the darkness
and realize that it is an amazing climb, regardless if your traveling up or
down.  One would think that the dwarves would be smart enough to install a
few torches, or possibly, some more of that glowing moss, so a person could
at least see where they were going and what they climbing, instead of
getting around only by feeling your way around.  The darkness seems to
devour the path leading downwards, whereas a small bit of light coming from
the moss, lights up your path to the east.

Somewhere on a dark path~
Looking around, nothing up nor down can be seen.  It's almost a struggle
just to see your hands right in front of your face.  Regardless of the
darkness, being that the walls feel unusually smooth to the touch and there
being only a limited amount of places for you to grab hold of to climb up or
down, the urge to press on with your travels reach out and grasp hold of
your soul.

At the bottom~
You are standing at the bottom of a very dark shaft.  Glowing moss grows
all around you, reflecting off the glass like surface of the obsidian walls
which make up this cavernous road.  Looking up, nothing but complete
darkness lurks through there and yet, looking further on north, the path
seems to get a little brighter.
